"RE: Rice. Nelson, I don't see any problems with #1. For number 2, mention that the paper was written when you were a studentt at Rice.

Most of the preparatory work for the class is already complete, so I don't foresee any large time commitment for this endeavor. If there is a problem, let me know. 2) A manuscript based on my dissertation work was recently accepted for publication by ASCE Journal of Environmental Engineering. I would like to use my Enron address and contact information on the work, but am unsure of company policies. I can certainly default to the Rice information if there is a problem. Nelson",4

"Re: CONFIDENTIAL - Residential in CA. Agreed. Trying to be too cute with our strategy is difficult. Look, about 4 years ago we pulled out of the market. I think that we need to simply accept that these customers are going back sooner or later. NPC won't even pick this up. Jim Paul Kaufman@ECT 04/13/2001 01:06 PM To: Karen Denne/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Jeff Dasovich Subject: Re: CONFIDENTIAL - Residential in CA I like the idea, particularly if we can time any decision to turn the customers back so it falls after the failure to get some action out of Sacto (instead of after our earnings release). The only problem I see is that we would need a decision from the top that we're not going to turn the customers back if we get direct access (so we can end the debate). I don't think it helps us if we get lucky, get direct access back, then make a decision to return customers to the utility.

I strongly believe that the public hit we will take will be far greater than our actual out-of-pocket losses. We will be crucified by the public, media, consumer groups, legislators, governor, attorney general, etc., and this action will reaffirm our reputation of packing up and leaving when it's not in our interest. The impact of this action would be exacerbated since it is on the heels of UC/CSU. I would also argue that this hurts our national dereg efforts. If we're advocating that competition and choice benefits consumers and then we turn around and pull out of a market and abandon customers when we're not ""profiting,"" we'll kill any chances we have of ever serving retail customers in California -- or in any other state. We look foolish advocating for direct access when we're not willing to serve our existing -- let alone future customers What about a preemptive strike that engages these 16,000 customers to weigh in on direct access -- i.e. a letter that says ""Enron may be forced to cancel its contract -- call/write/send the enclosed postcard to your legislator and tell them you want to keep your right to choose your energy service provider."" Our credibility is on the line. Before we take this action, we need to be cognizant of all the long-range strategic implications, and we need to seriously weigh the negative impact this will have on our corporate reputation, on our legislative abilities and on our commercial success going forward. kd James D Steffes 04/12/2001 09:05 PM To: Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT, Sandra McCubbin/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Janel Guerrero/Corp/Enron@Enron, Mark Palmer/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Karen Denne/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron, Peggy Mahoney/HOU/EES@EES, Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Dan Leff/HOU/EES@EES Subject: CONFIDENTIAL - Residential in CA In the meeting today, no decision was made about what to do with Enron's 16,000 residential customers. Each of the contracts gives a basic 30 day out right to Enron. That being said, I think that we have a short window to push for DA before any public action impacts us in Sacramento. I realize that the ultimate action (which I think is inevitable) makes it harder for our advocacy on DA, but real $ are flowing out of the company. EES will give us notice when a decision is reached.

"Protecting Confidential Information. The exciting cocktail of credit derivatives and Enron Online raises significant novel legal risks for Enron. As most of you will by now know, probably the most significant risk would arise in a situation where Enron has confidential information about a reference entity and wrongfully uses that information in pricing the credit derivative on that entity. This could well result in legal proceeding against Enron. In practice, an allegation of misuse of confidential information can be very difficult indeed to defend without adequate procedures in place to safeguard that information. In fact, Enron's credit trading will, as you know, rely strictly on publicly available financial information and will not involve the use of confidential information, unless the reference entity has specifically consented. Nevertheless, to avoid the appearance of impropriety, we are taking additional steps to consider confidentiality agreements we have in place with potential reference entities before deciding whether or not we will quote prices on such entities. Against this background is the ever-present risk of ""insider dealing"". This crime - which in the UK carries a maximum prison sentence of 7 years and an unlimited fine - is committed where a person (or member of their family etc) deals in the securities (shares, bonds or derivatives on them) of a listed company on the basis of unpublished (confidential) price-sensitive information. We do not expect at this time to deal in publicly traded bonds as part of EnronCredit.com, but insider dealing is relevant to the conduct of Enron staff and could affect other parts of our business. In addition, SFA rules in the UK require the safeguarding of confidential information, the misuse of which is a serious disciplinary matter. In order to ensure the success of this new business and that confidential information is not misused either by Enron or its staff, we are now introducing important new policies and procedures in Europe and in the US. These procedures have been drawn up specifically for your credit trading group by lawyers in London, Houston and New York and are attached. Please familiarise yourself, and any future member of the group, with these procedures. Once you have read and understood the attached procedures each one of you is required to confirm this to me in writing (or by note mail). Please note that similar procedures have been distributed to the key business heads in Europe who may have confidential information about reference entities (similar procedures are being disrtibuted to US business heads). This requires them to safeguard confidential information and to abide by the Restriced List procedure described below. Nevertheless, you should treat your group as being within a Chinese Wall and see it as your personal responsibility not to solicit or accept from anyone in Enron information about reference entities which may be confidential. Thank you for your co-operation in implementing these important new procedures. I look forward to receiving your confirmation mentioned above (which is also described in the procedures). Best regards Paul",0
"Re: AGA. What have they done for us? Terence H Thorn@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 10/03/2000 08:30 AM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: AGA Steve I need your help. Twice in the last three months I have run into the Chairman of AGA who has taken my head off for Enron not renewing its AGA dues. I understand that the dues had been paid by Stan Horton who had decided that the pipeline group with INGAA representing it had no need for and received no benefit from the membership. I guess a few years back, when AGA ""kicked"" the pipelines out, they renegotiated the dues into some type of sub membership for around 85K. AGA approached the gas marketing team and talked to Mike Roberts about renewing the membership and maintaining relations with his customers and later to Jeff Shankman who passed them off to some other person and never got back to them as promised. This is a heads up to tell you that Bob Catell of Brooklyn Union fame- one of Enron's oldest customers and friends will be calling Lay. It seems to me that pro rating the dues among ENA and EGM and maybe GPG might be a solution. Anyhow, I promised to pass on the complaint. Thanks.",0

"California Refund Proceeding Privileged and Confidential Attorney Work Product Attorney-Client Communication. In our litigation meeting last Tuesday, we learned that netting of spot purchases and sales is of paramount importance in limiting our exposure to refunds, under the FERC's July 26 Order, in both the California and Pacific Northwest proceedings. However, in the California proceeding we are also afforded the opportunity in the Order to offset our receivables against any refund that would otherwise have to be paid by us. Also, to the extent that our receivables exceed the refund amount, the Order provides for payment of interest to us in accordance with CFR Section 35.19a. At present, I am aware of the existence of three receivables. As you will recall, I mentioned at Tuesday's meeting that we should be able to treat as a receivable for purposes of offset, the revenues due us from the application of the CAISO underscheduling penalty. I communicated the possibility of offsetting this receivable against any potential refund at this mornings Western Wholesale conference call, and subsequent research conducted by Alan Comnes indicates that the CAISO owes us $30MM, as per the CAISO's own numbers. The CAISO also owes us approximately $40MM due to nonpayment for one to two months of business. These two figures alone, totalling approximately $70MM, exceed the estimate of our potential exposure in the California proceeding. Finally, the negative CTC issue is another receivable due us by IOU's that, under the plain language of the Order, could potentially be used to offset any refund amount. I am not aware of the magnitude of this receivable but do understand that there are some sensitivities regarding this issue, including concerns about revealing the amount of the credit due us.

LOS ANGELES -- In the latest attempt to fix California's troubled deregulated energy market, officials adopted a unique variable-pricing plan that already is being criticized by power generators and traders as unworkable and praised by utilities and consumers as much needed protection against gouging. Under the plan, adopted late last week by the governing board of the California Independent System Operator, or ISO, a quasipublic agency responsible for maintaining electricity reliability in the state, the cap on wholesale power will be reset hourly from about $65 per megawatt hour at low-demand times to no more than $250 an hour at periods of high demand. It was the third time this year that officials effectively lowered the price cap on wholesale electricity in a bid to contain -- so far unsuccessfully -- soaring total power costs. The move underscores the chaotic atmosphere prevailing in California's power market after a two-year-old experiment in deregulation has come undone. In other deregulated markets such as New York and New England, prices are capped at $1000 per megawatt hour, which are intended to be low enough to prevent market abuse but high enough to give generators incentive to build new plants. California's system was supposed to work the same way. But because utilities in California divested themselves of the bulk of their plants but weren't allowed to lock in fixed-price supply contracts, unlike in the other markets, merchant generators have had much greater sway over prices here on the spot market, where most power trades. During the first nine months of the year, the average price of wholesale electricity was $90 per megawatt hour in California, triple the price of a year earlier. Even on cool days in October, the price generally has remained above $100 per megawatt hour. California utilities have lost money on those power purchases because their customers' rates are frozen at $54 to $65 per megawatt hour, far lower than the average price utilities have had to pay for that power. The deficits exceeded $5 billion in the June-to-September period. California utilities buy the power used by their customers from the state-sanctioned auctions administered by the ISO and a sister organization, the California Power Exchange. In New York and New England, by comparison, less than 20% of power is purchased from the spot markets because utilities there were able to sign the fixed-price contracts, which California utilities weren't allowed to do. The price-cap decision passed last week by a vote of 13 to 10, primarily with support from utilities and board members representing consumer interests. It was pushed aggressively by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, the state's two big investor-owned utilities that have gotten caught in the price-spike vise this year. Some ISO members say they had no choice but to support the measure to ratchet down price caps. ""We're going after the windfall profits,"" said S. David Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, who voted for the measure. ""What we've got now is a market accustomed to ripping off the consumer. This can't be allowed to go on."" But other experts said the hasty measure may make California's problems even worse. ""The short-term regulatory fix is always to fix prices,"" said Pam Prairie, director of the Institute of Public Utilities at Michigan State University in East Lansing. ""But there's a real danger you'll set prices too low and make your supply problems even worse."" Other economists agreed. ""At best, this is poorly administered cost-based regulation,"" said Frank Wolak, an economics professor at Stanford University who sits on an independent market-monitoring committee at the ISO. ""At worst, it creates all sorts of perverse market incentives."" For example, it may increase the problem of ""megawatt laundering"" on hot days in which in-state generators sell power to out-of-state customers who then sell it back into the state, effectively bypassing the cap. Likewise, it could encourage generators to build new plants outside of California, rather than where they are needed near its major cities, also to avoid the cap. In the end, it could increase stresses to the state's already overburdened transmission system. In fact, the decision already has brought to a halt the state's forward electricity market, which allows wholesale customers to sign contracts for power they will use in the future. The market had been trading as much as 1,000 contracts a week. On Friday, there was practically no activity. ""This decision shows the height of lunacy,"" said Rick Shapiro, a managing director at Enron Corp., the giant Houston-based energy trader. Mr. Shapiro said Enron and other generators will file appeals at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission asking that the new pricing formula be rescinded. It is possible the FERC may throw out the pricing formula anyway. It is expected to issue a major order on Nov. 1 directing changes in California's market structure. That order will include its determination of the effectiveness of price caps. It also is expected to judge the merits of the governance structure at the ISO, which has lately been marked by infighting. Recently, consumer groups have charged that the ISO board has put the business interests of its members ahead of members' fiduciary duty to California residents. The most recent price-cap measure was approved over the objections of executives at the ISO whose job it will be to implement the formula. ISO Chief Executive Terry Winter said the measure is flawed because it doesn't take into account the amount of power available to the California market. Mr. Winter fears the caps will place the state at a disadvantage relative to neighboring states with no price caps. About 11 states are electrically interconnected in the West, meaning power can be moved between them and chase the highest prices. ""We keep getting accused of making our market too complicated,"" Mr. Winter said. ""Then along comes this proposal"" with caps that would adjust repeatedly throughout the day, depending on demand.

Enron Offers Cash To Help Azurix Take Itself Private By Rebecca Smith Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/30/2000 The Wall Street Journal A12 (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) Enron Corp. offered to lend Azurix Corp., an Enron spinoff, $275 million so that it could take itself private. Enron, which has been frustrated with the global water company's performance, suggested Friday that public shareholders receive a cash offer of $7 a share for their Azurix stock. While nearly double the stock's value prior to the offer, the suggested price nevertheless was far below the $19 at which Azurix made its debut in 1999. An Azurix spokeswoman said the board, on which Enron has seats, had not yet decided how to treat the Enron offer. An Enron spokesman said that taking the company private would ""give us more opportunity to directly affect our investment."" In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Azurix soared $3 to $6.56 in heavy trading. Azurix had hoped to create a splash by doing to the water business what Enron had done to the energy business -- increase competition and provide trading skills capable of creating new financial products out of old commodities. But Azurix stumbled, nearly from the outset. Deregulation of the water business and government privatizations of water systems, on which it was counting, were slow to come, crimping growth opportunities and profit. And Enron, accustomed to higher, faster returns, grew impatient with the capital-intensive water business. The company's first chief executive, Rebecca Mark, a onetime head of Enron's international division, resigned in the summer with the agreement of Enron executives, who said it was time for new leadership. The incoming chief executive, John Garrison, said he would look for buyers for some of the company's businesses; he was unavailable to comment Friday. Ms. Mark was believed to be considering making an offer for some of those businesses, herself. She declined a request for an interview. In its letter to Azurix officers, Enron said the water company received four offers from prospective suitors after Ms. Mark's departure, the best of which came from an unidentified bidder who offered $7 a share and went through a lengthy due-diligence process before backing down, apparently spooked by Azurix's cash flow, capital structure, tax considerations and some securities litigation. In its proposal letter, made public Friday, Enron said it concluded ""that there is no other buyer willing to pay the $7"" and so proceeded with its own offer. But Enron said it won't try to limit Azurix's ability to negotiate a better deal with others, should they come forward. Finally, Enron noted that Azurix had considered various partial or full-liquidation alternatives but said they didn't seem likely to produce more than $7 a share.

Business Wessex switch likely Adam Jones in New York 10/28/2000 The Times of London News International 2W 64 (Copyright Times Newspapers Ltd, 2000) Wessex Water's American parent company is likely to be taken private after a disastrous 14-month spell as a quoted company. Wessex, which provides water services to the South of England, was bought by Azurix in 1998 for Pounds 1.6 billion. Azurix wanted to use Wessex's expertise in privatised water supply to build a global business. However, since listing at $19 a share in June last year, Azurix stock has gone into freefall, closing at less than $4 earlier this week. Azurix slumped because it drastically misjudged the number of privatisation opportunities. It emerged last night that Enron, the Texan energy and trading company that is Azurix's biggest shareholder, has taken the unusual step of offering to lend Azurix $275 million (Pounds 190 million) to buy its publicly held shares, thereby taking it private. The Enron proposal would value Azurix at about $800 million or $7 per share - 63 per cent less than the IPO price. Enron would control Azurix and Wessex Water if it went private. Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. BUSINESS Enron water unit could go private under loan plan NELSON ANTOSH Staff 10/28/2000 Houston Chronicle 3 STAR 1 (Copyright 2000) Enron offered Friday to lend Azurix, its struggling water affiliate, about $275 million so Azurix can go private by purchasing 38.6 million shares that are publicly traded. The deal would have Azurix buying back its stock at $7 per share, about double what the shares were trading for Thursday. That's a big comedown for Azurix shares, which sold for $19 each when the Houston company went public in June 1999. The maneuver technically can be called a ""take-under,"" said analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities in Houston. She also described it as Enron's least painful solution for what to do with the venture that never lived up its ambitious plans. ""Nothing about Azurix has been positive for Enron, in my view,"" said Coale. ""This is a solution to a problem."" Azurix spokeswoman Diane Bazelides said its board is studying Enron's proposal. She added that it was too early to comment on the offer because the proposal's structure had not been outlined. Enron imposed no deadline for a decision by Azurix, but reserved the right to withdraw the offer if Azurix's position with prospective customers and employees deteriorated. One of Enron's conditions is that Azurix not sell any major assets before the buyout. The deal would not change Enron's large stake in Azurix, said Palmer. It owns a third, while the other third is owned by the Atlantic Water Trust, in which Enron owns a 50 percent voting interest. The proposal's advantages include giving public shareholders a premium to the market price, said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. The common stock of Azurix zoomed Friday on the news, gaining $3 to close at $6.56 on the New York Stock Exchange. Becoming a private company would give Azurix management greater flexibility in restructuring. Coale said it would reduce Azurix's general and administrative costs, helping it to bid against lower- cost foreign competition, particularly two big French companies. Azurix's high cost structure has been its primary problem, she said. Azurix has been looking at cost and strategies ever since it got a new president and chief executive on Aug. 25, said Bazelides. That was the date that Rebecca Mark resigned as Azurix's high-profile chairman and chief executive. Enron and Azurix have been looking at ""strategic alternatives"" for nine months, J. Mark Meets, Enron's executive vice president for corporate development, said in a letter filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. One alternative was selling the company, he said. That didn't work out because the offers from three companies didn't exceed $4 per share. The fourth potential buyer said it would consider offering $7 per share, said Meets. But that suitor backed out, citing reasons like cash flow, complexity of the capital structure, tax considerations and pending securities litigation. ""We are obviously quite disappointed by this most recent turn of events,"" Meets said in the letter. ""However, we strongly believe that there is no other buyer willing to pay the $7 per share initially proposed (but later withdrawn) by the fourth bidder."" Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Ken Herman American-Statesman Capitol Bureau Chief 10/28/2000 Austin American-Statesman A1 (Copyright 2000) Not long ago, at a glossy wooden table in a Texas Capitol office, two of Gov. George W. Bush's high-level appointees discussed one of the key issues in state government these days. It involved the relative merits of White House posts that could be available to the two appointees if Bush becomes president. Asked this week whether it's a common topic around the Capitol, one of the appointees gestured to the anteroom of his office and made a motion indicating that even the midlevel folks have Washington on their minds. Near the banks of the Colorado, Potomac Fever is a near-epidemic. And though it is political faux pas to be too open about doing White House transition planning before Election Day, be assured it is going on at Bush headquarters, where top officials are cognizant of the fine line between looking too confident now and looking too unprepared later. The candidate himself -- as well as his top aides -- steers clear of transition talk. When asked who might wind up in his Cabinet, Bush looks backward instead of forward, saying that his selection of Dick Cheney as his running mate should offer a glimpse of the kind of people who would wind up in his administration. The transition work, such that it is, is under the aegis of longtime Bush friend and aide Clay Johnson, who began as head of the gubernatorial appointments office and now serves as chief of staff. Johnson said nobody has been interviewed for any Washington post, but he has compiled a file of folks who are interested in serving in a Bush administration. Johnson also has been reading up on previous transitions -- ones that went well and ones that didn't. His preliminary conclusion is that the outgoing administrations are generally helpful and supportive, even if they were ousted by the incoming administration. It's the incoming administrations that can make the mistakes, he said. There is no shortage of think tanks that have think-tanked the topic. Back in August, the Heritage Foundation, based in Washington, issued a transition handbook titled ""The Keys to a Successful Presidency."" ""Though we really don't expect either campaign to talk about it (and would discourage them from doing so), the message here is it's time to start planning for a possible presidential transition, quietly, well behind the scenes, but with the understanding that the preparation done during the next 70 or so days, and the work done in the 70 or so days that follow (between the election and the inauguration) will very well determine the initial success or failure of the next administration,"" Herbert Berkowitz, a foundation vice president, said in releasing the study. All indications are that the Bush team has been following the advice, with Johnson at the helm. Johnson cautions against expectations that a Bush administration would be overloaded with Texans. ""It's the United States of America, not the United States of Texas,"" he said. Despite that caveat, there is no shortage of Texans who are considered shoo-ins to fill some of the thousands of slots Bush could offer if he wins. Johnson confirms that he is very interested in a Washington job. Early speculation among Bush aides makes Johnson a potential leading contender for head of personnel at the White House. Karen Hughes, Bush's communications director since his 1994 gubernatorial campaign, is expected to become Bush's press secretary if he wins the White House. Karl Rove, Bush's longtime political guru, also will be on board, though he could wind up with an out-of- the-White-House post, perhaps at the Republican National Committee. Not as certain is the potential future for Joe Allbaugh, who is part of the ""iron triangle"" of top advisers -- along with Rove and Hughes -- who have been on board with Bush since the 1994 campaign. Allbaugh serves as manager of the presidential campaign and previously served as chief of staff in the governor's office. Capitol speculation indicates Allbaugh could decide to skip a White House post, possibly in favor of a lobbying job, if he is not tapped as chief of staff. That post could go to Don Evans, a longtime Bush friend who headed the megasuccessful fund-raising effort for the presidential campaign. However, not everyone has Potomac Fever. For example, Terral Smith, Bush's legislative director, said he will stay in Austin to lobby. In addition to the speculation about appointees, the approaching election has sparked talk about when Bush might leave office if he wins. Under the U.S. Constitution, he could remain governor until he has to become president on Jan. 20. Much more likely, however, is that Bush would leave office sooner than that, perhaps as soon as two or three weeks after the Nov. 7 election, if he wins. That could cause a housing problem for Bush, whose main residence is the Governor's Mansion, which comes as a free perk of the job. The Bushes have a home under construction at their ranch in Crawford, near Waco. The ranch also has a smaller house in which the Bushes now spend weekends. Not out of the question is that Bush could work out an arrangement with Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, who would become governor if Bush resigns, to remain in the Governor's Mansion for several weeks after he leaves office. If the race among Texas senators to replace Perry as lieutenant governor complicates the timing of the resignation, Bush could stay in the governor's office a little longer, but no later than the first week of January. After all, he will want to give Perry time to bask in his gubernatorial inauguration before the Legislature convenes Jan. 9. No matter when Bush resigns, confidantes believe he might use his Crawford ranch for interviews with potential top-level appointees, including Cabinet members.

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A Dynegy executive said Friday that the California Independent System Operator's plan to impose hourly price caps on the wholesale power market will compromise reliability by forcing generators to sell electricity out of state. ""If the ISO says it will not buy above a certain price and generators cannot operate below that price, then we have no choice but to find other markets to participate in,"" said Dynegy senior vice president of marketing and trading asset management Lynn Lednicky. ""That may lead to the ISO not finding the power it needs at a price it wants to pay."" The ISO plans to construct hourly price caps each month based on forecast load, natural gas prices and generation unit efficiency. The caps will take effect Nov. 3 or soon therafter. Dynegy Inc. (DYN) sent a letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission asking it to address reliability consequences of the price caps before Nov. 3. Dynegy specifically requested that FERC discuss the issue at its Nov. 1 meeting, when it will release a report on California's electricity problems. Enron Corp. (ENE) and Southern Company (SO) share Dynegy's concerns about reliability and plan to petition FERC about the issue, said a trader listening in to a conference call between the three companies. -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872; jessica.berthold@dowjones.com Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES New York -(Dow Jones)- Shares of Azurix Corp. (AZX) jumped 84% in heavy trading Friday after parent Enron Corp. (ENE) proposed to take the company private in a $7-a-share buyout. Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that Enron made the proposal after not being satisfied with offers it had received from four third parties for its stake in Azurix. In a letter to two members of Azurix's board, Enron said three potential buyers ""were unlikely to be willing to pay more than the then-current market price of approximately $4 a share."" Enron said a fourth potential buyer indicated it would consider a $7-a-share offer, but it said that proposal was recently withdrawn. ""The reasons given by the bidder included pro forma cash flows, the complexity of the capital structure, tax considerations and the currently pending securities litigation,"" the letter said. Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Houston-based Enron, declined to say whether Enron was entertaining current third-party interests or was in any talks with other parties regarding its Azurix stake. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Azurix ended Friday up $3 to $6.56 on 2.8 million shares, compared with average daily volume of 239,000 shares. Enron was up $1.38, or 1.8%, to $78.88 on 1.6 million shares, compared with its daily average turnover of 2.4 million. In the SEC filing, Enron, saying it's familiar with Azurix's various partial and full liquidation alternatives, said its buyout proposal is conditioned upon Azurix not selling any significant assets prior to the buyout. ""Although we agree that such plans may result in greater value to Azurix's shareholders than the maintenance of the status quo, we believe that these options almost certainly will not result on a present value in a greater return to Azurix's shareholders than $7 a share,"" the letter said. Enron also said its buyout proposal doesn't include any breakup fees or other ""deal protection devices."" This frees Azurix's board to pursue an acquisition that ""might provide greater value"" to shareholders. Daine Bazelides, a spokeswoman for Azurix, declined to say whether Azurix is now entertaining offers for the company. She did, however, confirm the information contained in Enron's filing. ""The historical information in the filing is factually correct,"" she told Dow Jones Newswires. She said she doesn't know when Azurix board will respond to Enron's proposal. In the filing, Enron didn't set a deadline, but warned that Azurix's position with customers and employees may deteriorate further. ""We must therefore reserve the right to withdraw our proposal at any time,"" Enron's letter said. In the letter, Enron pointed out that Azurix had retained two ""internationally recognized investment bankers"" early this year to evaluate strategic alternatives, which included the potential sale of the company to unrelated third parties. Enron said it strongly believes there isn't another buyer willing to pay $7 a share for Enron's indirect interest in Azurix. ""We believe it is in Azurix's best interest, as well as the best interest of its shareholders and employees, if Azurix were no longer a publicly traded company,"" Enron said. -By Christopher C.

Enron offers to buy out Azurix Financial Times By Hillary Durgin in Houston Published: October 27 2000 23:31GMT | Last Updated: October 27 2000 23:36GMT Enron, the Houston-based energy and trading group, said on Friday it had offered up to $275m in funding to take Azurix private at a buy-out price of $7 per share. The specific structure of Enron's proposal has yet to be determined, Enron said. Azurix said its board would now consider the proposal. The timing of any decision was unclear. Enron owns directly and indirectly about 66 per cent of Azurix, the troubled Houston water company, whose main asset is UK-based Wessex Water. The buyout offer is the latest development in a history of problems at Azurix, which was spun off from Enron and taken public at an offering price of $19 per share. But a combination of poor market timing, competitive industry conditions and empty promises by the company on Wall Street took their toll on the company, whose shares have since plummeted and have been trading most recently around the $3-per-share range. In August, Rebecca Mark, Azurix chief executive officer, resigned both from Azurix and from the board at Enron. Enron's offer came after four unnamed parties approached Enron about buying its stake in Azurix. While three of the four were unwilling to pay more than the then market price of about $4 per share, a fourth party who was considering offering $7 per share (before accounting for any dilution for stock options) later declined to pursue the transaction, Enron said in Friday's letter to Azurix, outlining the buyout proposal. ""We strongly believe that our proposal is fair to Azurix's public stockholders,"" the letter stated. ""Our proposed transaction would permit Azurix's stockholders to receive, on a timely basis, a cash payment for their shares that is significantly above the price at which those shares have traded in several months."" Analysts that follow Azurix and had valued the shares at between $6 and $8 per shares said the offer was fair. Analysts that follow Enron said that Azurix's business strategy had proved to be a failure and was characteristic of the hard asset approach that Enron has gradually distanced itself from. Enron's shares closed at $78.88 up $1.38 on Friday. Azurix's shares rose $3 to close at $6.56.",0

SDG&E puts a full= =20 page ad in the local newspaper telling everyone that SDG&E is doing=20 everything it can to lower their electric bills, including asking the ISO f= or=20 a $250 price cap, but the public can help by calling the ISO [address and= =20 phone number provided in the ad] and urging them to lower the cap.?

Such an investigation would provide the factual foundation that=20 California policy makers and regulators need to recover any illegally=20 obtained profits.=20 =01&A momentous consequence of California's attempt to create a market in= =20 electricity is that the federal government now regulates California's=20 electric system.

What are the specific pressures and volume considerations that could make it operationally necessary to sell gas at the California border? 2. What is the process that is followed to make such a determination? 3. Which individuals or groups are involved in determining whether an operational sale is necessary? 4. In what way have system operations changed since last year and how do those changes contribute to the increased frequency of such sales compared to previous years? 5. What alternatives to operational sales are considered before the decision to make a sale is reached? Thanks for your attention to this request. Please give me a call to discuss and please designate your response as ""Privileged and Confidential, Attorney Client Privileged.""",0

"CPUC Hearing in SD on 9/8. In light of the Commerce Committee Hearing and the FERC Hearing on the 11th and 12th, wanted to provide a quick synopsis of the CPUC Hearing in SD. It was the same quasi-legislative format as the previous hearing. Speakers were invited by the Commission and only the ALJ and the Commissioners could cross-examine the witnesses. Commissioners Lynch and Wood presided. Michael Kahn, chairman of the Electricity Oversight Board was there and participated in some cross-examination as well. Speakers were: ISO: Kellan Fluckiger, COO Anjali Sheffrin, Director of Market Analysis Frank Wolak, Chairman of Market Surveillance Committee Cal PX: David Jermain, former VP, Compliance, Audits & Reg. Affairs Seth Wilson, South Coast Air Quality Management District: Carol Coy, Deputy Executive Director CPUC: Harvey Morris, Principal Attorney SDG&E: Donald Garber ISO's main message was that many factors contribute to the high prices in the wholesale market: 1. Demand growth over past two years at or around 5% (98-99, 99-00) 2. Lack of generation additions in entire west 3. Reduced imports of electricity from NW, due to low hydro and policy to retain water in spring. 4. Natural Gas price increases over 1999, at almost 2x's 1999 levels in August 5. Nox emissions trading at or around $40/pound 6. Increased underscheduling from June-August ISO has concluded that the reduction in the price caps (from $500 to $250) have increased the overall cost of electricity, with the highest total cost/MWh ($180) experienced in August, relative to $167/MWh in June and $118 in July. Reason given is that the caps have reduced markup (could be interpreted as generator profit) in peak hours, but supply costs have been driven up in lower load hours. While ISO staff said they will seek an extension of its authority from FERC to be set price caps, also raised concerns about the affect any further reductions would have on the market. They conclude that such a reduction would deter new investment, preclude generators from recovering fixed costs of production, and increase dependence on OOM purchases (as a result of lower imports). ISO staff will make a proposal to the ISO Board, October 6, to do the following: 1. File for extension of price cap authority to FERC. 2. Request FERC to institute mandatory forward contract requirement on generators for a significant portion of their capacity. 3. CPUC should allow full peak requirements to be forward contracted and hedged by UDCs 4. CPUC and state should promote price responsive demand programs 5. Maintain sufficient planning reserves. ISO Staff also stated that: 1. Need to create disincentive for underscheduling for load and generation a. Charge OOM cost to underscheduled load b. Charge replacement reserve cost to underscheduled generation c. Additional charge for real-time market transactions 2. Attract and expedite new resources MARKET POWER: While the Commissioners spent the majority of the day picking apart the underlying reasons for the rise in prices, the conclusion of the hearing was President Lynch asking the ISO and PX to name names on who has been exerting market power. Both the PX and the ISO said that it would be impossible to determine from the information they have. Secondly, the analysis they have done show that no single market participant is consistently exhibiting the ability (opportunity) to exercise market power. Therefore, at one point or another, nearly every market participant has market power. Wolak suggested that in order to reduce the amount of market power in peak periods, require forward contracting OR increase profit incentives in off-peak period, where generators many times sell below short-run marginal costs. No further quasi-legislative hearings are planned.",0

"Re: Barton Bill. Thanks for the explanation. I agree, though I may not have explained the context adequately to Ken. Linda Robertson 05/11/2001 04:32 PM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: Barton Bill You seemed troubled by the call to Barton. This bill may or may not be subsumed by the comprehensive energy bill that Congress undertakes this summer. Both bills have a very difficult, if not nearly impossible, path ahead given that the Democrats are in no mood for compromise. The call to Barton was to: a) repair relationships (and with the Wall Street Journal calling Barton about his troubled past with Enron, repair is needed); b) proclaim victory, even of a limited nature (something I think Enron has not done much of); c) build a further bond with Barton so we would have more input at full Committee (something we will need given the chances that this will go off the track are real); and d) allow Enron to get significant credit for the defeat of price caps. I hear from lots of DC sources that we have not had any success in the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Numerous folks at the markup noted in private conversations that this was Enron's first real role in the Committee. Thus, even though this is a very limited bill, the call made sense. I do not think that this means we should call the White House to push the bill with them. The bill itself still has lots of obstacles and many potential threats ahead.",0

"Observations on the Hearings this Week. We're in the process of developing a strategy to take us through the next few months. But while the (otherwise perishable) thoughts are still fresh in my mind from the hearings on Monday and Tuesday, I wanted to throw out some observations for discussion in the days/weeks ahead. OBSERVATION--The pressure to finger somebody for ""price gouging"" is increasing. The administration is hell bent on finding a ""fall guy."" The price spikes pose real political risks for Davis and he and his folks need and want an easy way out. His press release following the hearing renewed the call for ""refunds."" On my panel, Loretta Lynch asked Reliant and Duke to supply her with the details of the contracts they cut to sell their power forward to marketers. And Carl Wood's remarks were extreme. At the Barton hearing, a liberal democrat (Filner) and a conservative Republican (Hunter) locked arms in calling for refunds. Bilbray joined the ""gouging"" band wagon. The utilities repeatedly called on FERC to do a ""real"" investigation, with hearings, testimony, data discovery---the works. On the positive side, the FERC commissioners lauded Wolak, his analysis, and his remarks on the panel. Wolak said somewhat emphatically that the nature of California's market structure makes it impossible to single out a single participant as the culprit. He also stated that just everyone's just acting in their own self-interest, responding to the screwed incentives embedded in the structure. IMPLICATION--It seems prudent for Enron to understand better its risks of getting fingered. In the best case, the clamoring for a ""refund"" subsides. In which case, the only cost to Enron is the internal cost incurred to understand better the risks of getting fingered. In the medium case, investigations find that Enron (like others) ""played by the rules,"" but the rules stunk, and Enron profited at the expense of California consumers.",0

"Re: A&M - Bush Library Foundation & School of Public Policy. Let's talk. While there is always some value in these things it is ususally quite small and consumes more valuable resources in trying to capture the benefit than the benefit itself. From: Michael B Rosen@ECT on 07/13/2001 08:44 AM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: A&M - Bush Library Foundation & School of Public Policy Steve- We have been approached by the Texas A&M/George Bush Presidential Library Foundation and School of Public Policy to endow additional funds. Enron had made an original contribution to the library foundation back in 1998 totaling $250K over five years. I am working with Community Relations and A/A Recruiting to evaluate the latest request and to discuss where Enron may have interest or find leverage for our Government Affairs, Recruiting, or PR efforts. The Foundation is willing to work with us to establish whatever type of program(s) and/or participatory involvement we would like. We have discussed an Enron speaker series, classroom lectures, advisory committee seats and the likes. I have already had a chance to run this by Rick Shapiro and Rob Bradley.

"Re: FW: fact sheet- latest draft. I think it's a good document and carves out some solid policy ground for Bush. I think the electricity section needs some additions though. There is not a lot that the current administration can do about siting new plants and power lines -- its largely a state and local decision. Further, the problem has been less about government failing to provide adequate incentives to utilities than it has been about a failure of the current commission to opening the grid on a nondiscriminatory basis. Once utilities are in the open access transmission business they will look for ways to invest in the grid and stop getting in the way of independent power producers who want to connect to the grid. The answer is open access, so power can get from where it is to where it is needed. This has been clear for a long time, yet the current administration (and its appointees on FERC) have yet to use their authority to make this happen. The result: spiking prices and reliability problems.

"Re: NEW DRAFT OF ENRON STATEMENT. I know we are holding for a later filing, but I have attached further comments anyway. The document is still too rough to send out. We need to take the opportunity, as soon as possible, to get a hard hitting, thoroughly researched and carefully written document in front of the Commissioners. California's reaction to the Judge's recommendation is likely to give FERC (especially the new commissioners) a feel for how irrational the California politicians can be. We will have a limited opportunity to take advantage of that realization. We need to hit it hard in the pleading, our conversations at the Commission, the Hill and the media.

But he also said there is a right way and a wrong way to do it. Enron and others had provided a market based answer by offering a fixed price deal to SDG&E (which would have enabled them to cap rates to those who had not switched.

PELTZ, Times Staff Writer=20 ?????A debate now rages in California over whether price controls should be= =20 adopted to stem the state's soaring power costs and help consumers who are= =20 bracing for huge spikes in their electric bills. ?????But price controls are one of the most controversial actions in=20 economics--and in politics, for that matter. And now the caps are more in= =20 dispute than ever because they run counter to the nation's move over the la= st=20 two decades to deregulate more and more industries, from airlines to=20 railroads to energy. ?????Yet California is a good example of deregulation gone haywire, so=20 controls are again being demanded by lawmakers, consumer advocates and othe= rs=20 as a way to check surging prices. On the other side is a chorus of critics= =20 who ridicule price caps as being ineffective and, at times, making matters= =20 worse for consumers. ?????Case in point: the Golden State itself, which tried last summer to use= =20 temporary price caps to keep a lid on skyrocketing wholesale electricity=20 prices. ?????Critics claim that the caps drove power sales out of state, thus=20 widening the imbalance between supply and demand, reinforcing the existing= =20 shortages and contributing to this winter's rolling blackouts. ?????But defenders of the caps note that the dysfunctional California marke= t=20 had no way to self-correct. The utilities couldn't simply refuse to buy=20 electricity in the face of higher prices, and with no price ceiling in sigh= t,=20 something had to be done. ?????And now Gov. Gray Davis and others are again calling for temporary=20 controls until more electricity supplies can be added, especially as the=20 state enters the peak-power summer season. On Tuesday, Sens. Dianne Feinste= in=20 (D-Calif.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) introduced legislation that would impo= se=20 price controls on wholesale energy throughout 11 Western states. ?????Mindful of the controversial history of controls, Feinstein and Smith= =20 stressed that the caps would last only through March 1, 2003. But they also= =20 argued that the economic damage to industries and consumers from escalating= =20 power costs would exceed any harm caused by price controls. ?????""I have a strong preference for markets, but it's a mistake to believe= =20 that we have a free market when it comes to energy,"" said Smith, the only G= OP=20 co-sponsor of the legislation. ?????Their bill would require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, whi= ch=20 regulates U.S. wholesale electricity prices, either to impose a regional=20 price cap or institute a rate schedule for each power generator, tying the= =20 price of electricity to the cost of producing it. ?????Coincidentally, FERC today is expected to decide on various other=20 proposals to again limit California's power costs--but without explicitly= =20 stating that the plans include price controls. Why? Because the Bush=20 administration and FERC Chairman Curt Hebert Jr., among others, are on the= =20 record as adamantly opposing price caps. ?????That's not surprising. Price controls often are tagged as a liberal=20 maneuver that flies in the face of conservatives' free-market ideology. Yet= ,=20 ironically, hanging over the California debate is the legacy of a Republica= n=20 president who was the last one to mandate price controls on a nationwide=20 level: Richard M. Nixon. ?????The late president took that rare step 30 years ago this August to try= =20 to quell inflation and spark an economic rebound. His actions were so=20 dramatic that they are still invoked by those wanting to criticize or, in= =20 some cases, endorse setting limits on prices. ?????""What he did is almost larger than life now,"" said Shannon Burchett,= =20 chief executive of RiskLimited Corp., a strategic consulting firm in Dallas= . ?????Nixon's controls were the most far-reaching since World War II, when= =20 prices were capped so that profiteers couldn't reap huge sums for scarce=20 commodities being used for the war and simultaneously rationed at home. ?????In most cases, price controls have been much less sweeping and targete= d=20 at specific products or services. They don't always involve changing the la= w,=20 either. In 1962, President Kennedy publicly rebuked the then-U.S. Steel Cor= p.=20 and its chairman, Roger Blough, for starting an industrywide move to raise= =20 steel prices. The price hikes were rolled back a few days later. ?????Since Nixon, price controls have become rarer as industries that were= =20 once regulated--which means their prices were government-controlled--have= =20 been deregulated. ?????So it is in California, where electric utilities' prices were controll= ed=20 for decades until the state's deregulation law in 1996. But now that the la= w=20 has been blamed for the soaring wholesale prices, power shortages, crippled= =20 utilities and the need for a huge jump in ratepayers' costs, some again wan= t=20 price controls on electricity until the crisis eases. ?????Which brings everyone back to Nixon. ?????Some Nixon Controls Were Lifted by Reagan ?????""I've heard people make the analogy to what happened . . . when Nixon= =20 put on controls,"" but in California ""this is fundamentally different,"" said= =20 Mike Florio, a board member of the California Independent System Operator,= =20 which oversees most of the state's electricity grid. ?????""When you get into a situation of shortage [of supplies], there is=20 really no restraint at all on prices,"" said Florio, who said he normally=20 prefers unfettered markets but also defended the state's caps last summer.= =20 Such government intervention ""on a temporary basis is better than nothing,= =20 but I don't think it's ideal."" ?????The reverberations from Nixon's fiat aren't just felt in California=20 either. When New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani recently proposed more stringe= nt=20 controls on wholesale electricity costs in New York state, critics promptly= =20 pointed to Nixon's controls. ""They were a disaster,"" one columnist wrote. ?????Even Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who was in the private= =20 sector in the early 1970s, turned down several requests to take high-level= =20 White House jobs in part because he was disgusted with Nixon's price contro= ls. ?????Many economists and historians also judge Nixon's controls as a mistak= e.=20 But some maintain that his decision--which began with a 90-day freeze on=20 prices, wages and rents--wasn't entirely a failure and even provided ""shock= =20 value"" that, for a while at least, arrested higher inflation. ?????In addition, part of Nixon's move involved taking the dollar off the= =20 gold standard--which in effect meant its price was controlled--and letting = it=20 float in value against other major currencies. And that, many believe, is t= he=20 base upon which today's global financial markets operate. ?????Others disagree. ?????""There really isn't an example of where they've [price controls]=20 worked,"" said Robert Goldberg, a senior fellow at the National Center for= =20 Policy Analysis, a nonpartisan think tank in New York. ?????""Controls always lead to an underproduction"" of the commodity involved= =20 because producers don't have any incentive to spend more on additional=20 output, he said. When the caps ultimately are lifted, prices typically soar= =20 anyway as producers move to quickly recoup the profit they lost when the=20 controls were in place, Goldberg added. ?????Others note that although most of Nixon's price controls lasted only a= =20 couple of years, various forms of controls over crude oil and natural gas= =20 lasted for another decade until they were removed by President Ronald Reaga= n. ?????In the meantime, the controls--aggravated by embargoes and other suppl= y=20 cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries--distorted the fr= ee=20 market for energy, critics say. The controls kept U.S. oil prices=20 artificially low, which in turn kept demand for oil high, giving OPEC more= =20 power over world production and prices in the 1970s, they contend. ?????Nonetheless, proponents keep calling for controls when prices for=20 certain items seem to be spiraling out of control. ?????Critics Say Controls Worsen the Problems ?????President Clinton's massive health-reform proposal in the early 1990s= =20 included price controls on drugs. But the idea set off howls of protest fro= m=20 the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, and ultimately the entire= =20 proposal was shelved. Consumer advocates and others also demanded federal= =20 controls on rising cable TV rates in 1997 and 1998, again contending that t= he=20 cable operators were hiking prices at a much faster rate than inflation.=20 Cable firms were allowed to keep passing certain costs on to their=20 subscribers, but specific price caps weren't enacted. ?????But proponents of temporary price controls on California power emphasi= ze=20 that electricity isn't in the same category as an airplane seat, steel or= =20 other commodities that don't have to be bought if the price soars too high. ?????""In soybeans maybe the market can adjust quickly"" to changes in supply= =20 and demand, ""but in electric generation in California it can't,"" said Flori= o,=20 who also serves as an attorney for the Utility Reform Network, a consumer= =20 group. ""For most products, one of the ways prices get determined is if buye= rs=20 refuse to buy when the price gets too high. But that's generally not an=20 option for people when it comes to electricity."" ?????Critics of California's attempt to cap prices last summer said the=20 controls instead prompted many power suppliers to sell their electricity to= =20 other states. That ""actually made the tight-supply problem worse [in=20 California] by driving imports out of the state,"" the Bay Area Economic=20 Forum, a research group funded by regional business and government agencies= ,=20 said in a report last week. ?????Indeed, the temporary caps were basically abandoned by year's end to= =20 keep enough electricity in the state. ?????Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economics professor who heads the= =20 Independent System Operator's market surveillance committee, said there are= =20 ways to mitigate the state's power prices without having to set rigid=20 controls. One proposal: Have FERC require that generators supply 75% of the= ir=20 expected future sales to California under long-term contracts at ""just and= =20 reasonable"" prices set by the federal agency, he said. ?????That would ""send the right [price] signal to suppliers to come into th= e=20 state,"" Wolak said. ?????And because it will take time for California to get more of its own=20 power-generating plants up and running, the state's electricity crisis isn'= t=20 unlike a natural disaster in which ""normal public service is disrupted"" and= =20 short-term controls serve a purpose, Florio said. ?????""Over time, market forces will work"" and controls shouldn't be need, h= e=20 said.

And those living downwind are subjected to twice as much= =20 air pollution as before California's energy crunch. ?????Not every Glendale resident is happy. ?????""You don't want anyone to get stuck with a rolling blackout, but we ge= t=20 struck with the pollution,"" Jerold Petrosian said as he and his family boug= ht=20 plants at a nursery across the street from the power plant. ""It is a tough= =20 decision."" ?????Not so for Ignacio Troncoso, director of Glendale Water & Power. ""Ther= e=20 is a pretty decent trade-off, helping our neighbors in the state to keep=20 their lights on,"" he said. ?????A USC specialist warned that increased power plant emissions raise the= =20 risks of asthma and other lung ailments in the young and old. ?????""There is a potential for more emergency room visits, more people seei= ng=20 their doctors and more hospitalizations this summer,"" said Dr. Henry Gong,= =20 professor of medicine and a specialist in the health effects of air polluti= on. ?????With extended hours, the Glendale generators are emitting as much as 9= 95=20 pounds of pollutants into the air during peak demand, more than double the= =20 old limit of 390 pounds a day, city and air-quality officials said. ?????The other 14 power plants in Southern California also have more than= =20 doubled their overall emissions, according to preliminary figures from the= =20 South Coast Air Quality Management District. As a group, the plants emitted= a=20 total of 2,045 tons of smog-forming nitrogen oxide in the first three month= s=20 of 2001, compared with 905 tons for the same period last year. ?????The AQMD hearing board on Tuesday eased pollution controls so Glendale= =20 may continue to generate excess electricity for sale to the energy-starved= =20 state. Under the plan, Glendale may run three of its old steam boilers=20 around-the-clock to meet the state's energy demand. Usually, these boilers,= =20 hidden behind a tall brick wall, sit idle except during the peak summer=20 demand because they are inefficient and costly. ?????Glendale, like Burbank and the Los Angeles Department of Water and=20 Power, continues to produce electricity at its city-owned plant. The three= =20 cities opted against participating in a scheme of deregulation, a decision= =20 that has shielded their residents, by and large, from the huge utility rate= =20 hikes and rolling power outages experienced elsewhere. But they also will= =20 contribute to easing the state's energy emergency in the dirtier air they= =20 will be forced to breathe. ?????Air-quality officials said power plants contribute just about 3% of th= e=20 900 tons of pollution emitted into the air daily, with about 70% of the=20 pollution coming from vehicles, not factories. And in recent years, many of= =20 the region's municipal power generators have been updated with=20 pollution-control devices that reduce emissions. ?????Glendale's three steam generators, built between 1953 and 1963, are=20 inefficient by today's standards, but they are 85% cleaner since the city= =20 pumped millions of dollars into upgrades. They will be even cleaner, city= =20 officials say, with more retrofitting. ?????Under the plan, Glendale must reinvest profits from energy sales,=20 estimated at $3 million to $5 million this year, in equipment to reduce=20 future emissions at the plant and in community-based programs, such as mobi= le=20 asthma clinics and programs to reduce school bus emissions. ?????The city plans to sell as much as 50 megawatts of power, enough to ser= ve=20 50,000 homes. Under the decision Tuesday, pollution limits resume Jan. 1,= =20 2002, or when the energy emergency ends. ?????In Los Angeles, power officials said they don't expect to exceed AQMD= =20 caps, because they are adding pollution controls at two of the city's four= =20 power plants. Although they will produce more electricity, they should not= =20 produce any more nitrogen oxide, which in sunlight and heat form ozone, sai= d=20 Angelina Galiteva, LADWP's director of strategic planning. ?????""We will have much cleaner equipment in place by June,"" she said. ?????Even the environmentalists are trying to balance the risks. ?????""We realize we have a problem this summer. We have to run these plants= ,""=20 said Sheryl Carter, a senior policy analyst for the National Resources=20 Defense Council. ?????Carter said natural-gas-powered generators, like the ones in Glendale,= =20 are ""a far superior solution to diesel generators,"" which produce 50 to 100= =20 times the emissions and would be turned on in businesses across the state i= f=20 energy is unavailable from other sources. ?????""We are trying to make sure the environment overall is made whole,"" sh= e=20 said. ?????Carl Zichella, regional staff director for the Sierra Club, said the= =20 generators should be run as a last resort. He also urged consumers to unplu= g=20 spare refrigerators and use energy-efficient light bulbs to reduce the=20 state's overall energy demand. ?????""The only thing that is going to work to offset air pollution is=20 efficiency,"" he said. Otherwise, ""we will pay not only with higher rates bu= t=20 also with our health."" ?????In neighboring Burbank, city officials are preparing for peak summer= =20 energy demands, when they expect to sell about 10% of their locally produce= d=20 electricity outside the city. ?????""For four or five years, we have been polluting Utah, Arizona, Nevada,= =20 Washington and Oregon, importing power to Los Angeles,"" said Ron Davis,=20 general manager of Burbank Water & Power, listing the energy-producing stat= es=20 that typically produce the bulk of Southern California's power. ""We are=20 returning the favor."" ?????Profits from those outside sales, Davis said, will help hold down=20 utility costs for local users. ?????""I think most people would take a little more smog to guarantee there= =20 are no rolling blackouts,"" he said.

Noise and pollution are concerns.=20 By CHRISTINE HANLEY, Times Staff Writer=20 ?????On Hula Circle in Huntington Beach, families have tried to live with= =20 their two very different neighbors. They live steps from the Pacific Ocean= =20 but next door to the mechanical shrieks and foul smells of the massive AES= =20 Corp. power plant. ?????But California's power crisis is rapidly unhinging life in the=20 neighborhood of ranch houses and bungalows. ?????State regulators will decide next week whether to allow the company to= =20 double the plant's operations by July, providing much-needed electricity bu= t=20 taking what residents fear will be a heavy toll on them. ?????It's one of several proposals to restart or build new power plants in= =20 the wake of the power crisis using a ""fast track"" process that allows the= =20 projects to go forward before environmental and pollution studies are=20 completed. ?????""The plant is so close. We want to know if it is impacting our kids in= =20 ways we won't know about until 10 years from now,"" said Janette Mortimer, w= ho=20 lives with her husband and their two young children in one of the homes=20 closest to the plant. ?????Already, residents say, the AES plant is casting a mightier shadow.=20 There are the ear-ringing rumbles and roars. There are the mysterious plume= s=20 of smoke that waft over the neighborhood. Then there is the grime that seem= s=20 never to go away. ?????If the California Energy Commission approves the permit for AES, the= =20 facility could run at full capacity for the first time in memory. Officials= =20 said the plant's previous owner, Southern California Edison, typically ran = it=20 at 30% of capacity. ?????AES could be allowed to run the four gas-fired boilers and a ""peaker""= =20 unit whenever California hits a Stage 3 alert--which is expected to happen= =20 often this summer. The ""peaker"" plant alone is powered by eight jet=20 engines--and sounds like it. ?????Currently, only two boilers are operating. ?????But residents say they are most worried about the air they breathe and= =20 the water they swim in. ?????Under the fast-tracking process designed to get more electricity for t= he=20 state as soon as possible, several key environmental questions have yet to = be=20 studied. ?????Scientists studying the cause of ocean pollution that closed much of= =20 Huntington Beach's shoreline in the summer of 1999 said that the plant, alo= ng=20 with other factors, played a role by drawing partially treated sewage that = is=20 discharged miles offshore back toward the coast. ?????AES Inc. will pay $1.5 million to further study the issue, but the=20 research won't be complete for some time. ?????""So much is uncertain,"" said Huntington Beach Councilwoman Shirley=20 Dettloff. ""These are big, big things."" ?????For now, residents say they are bracing for more noise, smoke and=20 disruption. ?????To begin with, AES' proposal calls for 20 hours a day of nonstop=20 construction to get the two mothballed generators in service by July. ?????Then there are the sizzling summer temperatures. Residents usually ope= n=20 their windows to let the ocean breezes cool their homes. But the noise and= =20 smells from the plants may make that impossible. ?????""It's going to be bad. There's no escape,"" said Bryan Visnoski. ?????The plant has towered over the Huntington Beach coastline for nearly 4= 0=20 years. The housing tracts came later, but most inhabitants of Hula Circle a= nd=20 surrounding streets seemed to make peace with their industrial neighbor. ?????Some have installed double-paned windows to dampen the sound. Others= =20 have remodeled their homes to obstruct ugly views. The Mortimers grew tall= =20 trees and trained vines past the windows. ?????The problems, they say, began with the energy crisis. ?????The plant was owned by Edison until 1998, when it was sold to=20 AES--California's largest private electricity producer--at the dawn of=20 deregulation. ?????The two gas-fired boilers that AES wants to restart have been dormant= =20 since 1995 and were slated for demolition until the power crisis struck. ?????But a few months ago as rolling blackouts hit the state, Gov. Gray Dav= is=20 signed an executive order allowing ""peaker plants"" to operate at extended= =20 hours. ""Peaker plants"" can produce electricity in quick bursts but guzzle= =20 large amounts of natural gas and are noisy. ?????Hulu Circle residents said the order has resulted in more hours of lou= d=20 jet noises that make then feel like they live by an airport. ?????Whenever the peaker plant goes on, residents call the Air Quality=20 Management District to send someone to test the plume of smoke. The=20 inspections have not detected any violations. ?????The proposal before the state Energy Commission would allow AES to=20 double its electricity output in Huntington Beach from 500 megawatts to 1,0= 00=20 megawatts. ?????The company's two 40-year-old units represent about 10% of the 5,000= =20 additional megawatts Davis has promised to meet an expected energy shortfal= l=20 this summer. ?????Despite the fast-tracking process, the company has vowed that it would= =20 safeguard against environmental damage and remedy any problems from plant= =20 operations. ?????If the plant is identified as drawing bacteria back to shore, AES woul= d=20 have to pay the costs deemed necessary to fix problems. ?????This is little consolation to residents, who would prefer a full=20 environmental review.

Gray Davis on energy issues=20 Gov. Gray Davis visited the Mercury News editorial board Monday. On the=20 subject of electricity, Davis talked about increasing the number of power= =20 plants, the rejection of price caps by the Federal Energy Regulatory=20 Commission, and the condition of the state's two largest utilities, Souther= n=20 California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. Davis has proposed a deal to= =20 rescue Edison, and the Legislature is considering it. PG&E has filed for=20 bankruptcy.=20 Here is a condensed version of Davis' remarks.=20 Q: What would you like to say by way of introduction about the state's=20 electricity problems?=20 Davis: There are really two problems. One is the amount of power available= =20 and the other is the price of power.=20 In 2002, we'll have more megawatts on line, at least 5,000 more. By 2003,= =20 we'll have a slight excess of power over demand. That's very important.=20 Because at the moment, we import 20 percent of our power. We have no=20 leverage. We are at the mercy of forces that show no mercy. That will never= =20 change until we have more power than we need.=20 OK, price. As you know, the only entity that can influence the [wholesale]= =20 price of electricity is the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.=20 Deregulation surrendered the ability of the state to do that.=20 In 1999, this state for all power, including municipal power, spent roughly= =20 $7 billion. In 2000, we spent $32.5 billion. I don't know what it will be= =20 this year, but it will be substantially higher.=20 Through all this the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has refused to do= a=20 thing, zero, zippo. Lest you think I'm being partisan, that commission=20 consists entirely of Clinton appointees.=20 The final piece is the financial consequences of what's happened to date. I= t=20 is our hope that if we can keep Southern California Edison credit-worthy an= d=20 able to re-enter the power purchasing market Jan. 1, 2003, we can then go t= o=20 the PG&E creditors committee [the generators to whom PG&E owes money] and s= ay=20 to them: ``Look at the arrangement we made with Southern California Edison.= =20 We believe that this is a far better deal than PG&E can give you.''=20 I think this is a fair plan. We get every electron that Edison's utility ow= ns=20 committed for 10 years, at a cost-of-service basis. Under [current law] the= y=20 could sell that next March at market rates. We got $400 million returned fr= om=20 the holding company, a $3 billion investment in the transmission and delive= ry=20 systems .?.?. a permanent easement on about 20,000 acres of environmental= =20 property around all their hydro facilities.=20 Q: Do you have in mind a finished product for the changes that are happenin= g=20 in the electric system? What will it look like in a couple of years?=20 Davis: It is my expectation that the utilities will be purchasing the power= =20 entirely, commencing Jan. 1, 2003. Our goal is to get them back in business= .=20 In addition to investor-owned utilities, I believe we also need a public=20 power authority. At some point I believe the private sector will say to=20 itself, ``I want to build new plants to replace the 40-year-old plants, but= =20 do I really want to get the state to a 15 percent margin over supply, there= by=20 reducing the value of the electrons I already own?'' If they do, God bless= =20 them. But if they don't, at least we'll have the opportunity to build them= =20 ourselves.=20 Once we have even a slight margin of capacity over demand, the spot market= =20 prices will come down dramatically.=20 Q: You said in February that you could have solved the electricity problem = in=20 20 minutes if you'd been willing to raise rates. Now, rates are going to be= =20 raised. Should you have favored a rate increase earlier?=20 Davis: I should have been more specific. I should have said I could have=20 solved it in 20 minutes if I wanted to triple rates. I think the rate=20 increase I proposed is fair. It rewards people who are the most energy=20 efficient, the people who only use up to 130 percent of their baseline. The= y=20 are approximately half the state. So half the state will see no rate=20 increase, beyond the 10 percent that everyone saw in January.=20 Q: Is the state willing to spend anything it costs to keep the lights on, o= r=20 at some point, would it stiff the generators and just say we will accept a= =20 blackout?=20 Davis: We have to provide power. There are many people who have medical=20 devices that have to keep running. Blackouts can cause deaths, traffic=20 accidents, all kinds of calamities that I wouldn't want to happen.=20 I'm reluctant to tell the generators we'll pay any price, so I'm not going = to=20 say we'll pay absolutely any price, but my bias obviously is to find a way = to=20 keep the lights on.=20 Q: When will you reveal how much electricity the state has bought, from wha= t=20 companies, at what prices and what this will cost the state this year and i= n=20 coming years?=20 Davis: We'll reveal an awful lot of information as soon as the bonds go to= =20 market. [The state plans a bond issue to cover the upfront costs of=20 purchasing electricity.] That information has to be made public. That will= =20 probably be in less than two months.=20 Believe me, I don't like going around getting beat up for hiding informatio= n.=20 I'm doing it for one reason only, which is that I know every additional edg= e=20 I give the generators will result in higher prices for customers.=20 Q: There's an impression that the state budget is being drained by the powe= r=20 crisis. Is that right?=20 Davis: The simple answer to that is no, because the state will be fully=20 reimbursed with interest as soon as these bonds are sold.=20 At the moment, in the short term, it is crowding out other spending. But I= =20 think everyone understands that's a temporary phenomenon, until the state i= s=20 reimbursed by bonds that are repaid over time through the rate structure th= at=20 I proposed.=20 Q: Would it be your pledge that ratepayers, not taxpayers, will fully repay= =20 the state's cost in purchasing electricity?=20 Davis: That is the assumption underlying these bonds. That's right as it=20 relates to electricity, but obviously the conservation incentives came out = of=20 the general fund.=20 Q: Have you talked to President Bush about this?=20 Davis: I hear all these rumors as to why the Bush administration doesn't wa= nt=20 to be helpful, but this state, and particularly this region, has been=20 disproportionately helpful in America's economic growth and technological= =20 productivity. If he wants America to grow, it behooves him to keep Californ= ia=20 growing.

""The implications for the development of competitive energy markets go far beyond the Western United States,"" Andersen's national utility practice head Matthew D. Smith told a Washington briefing. ""Unfortunately, California has taught the nation that regulatory and political barriers can create and sustain an energy crisis."" ""California has demonstrated that the risks in the electricity industry, if not properly acknowledged and managed, can simultaneously and profoundly impact all market participants. To be effectively managed, these risks need to be exposed, assumed or shared, measured and monitored. When they are hidden or ignored, all parties can potentially suffer. A shared, integrated view of these risks, and a strategy for their assumption and management, is critical to avoiding rapid value destruction within the energy market,"" Smith said. An Andersen survey of senior utility executives outside California, also released at the briefing, indicates most utility companies believe they inoculated themselves against the California virus so that it is unlikely to affect their operations beyond slowing the pace of deregulation and increasing investor scrutiny. However, based on the potential implications it sees of the California situation, Andersen believes a series of booster shots are advisable for power companies and regulators. ""To deliver reliable service at a predictable cost in today's environment, companies must focus on market integration by developing new and innovative relationships between suppliers, customers, employees and investors -- while working with government officials and regulators to chart a smoother transition to a deregulated power market,"" according to Smith. Eight Implications The Andersen report identified eight overriding implications emanating from the Western energy crisis that are shaping the longer-term operations of the Western grid, the regional and national economy, domestic energy policy and the industry's evolution: 1. Increased deregulation uncertainty and risk -- Tension and differences between state and federal regulators raise the specter of repeating the regulatory and political conundrum California's investor-owned utilities have faced. If federal initiatives open wholesale markets while retail markets remain regulated, a crucial question is raised: Will state regulators pass-through higher wholesale costs if they should materialize? Tensions between state and federal regulators over policies on deregulation will grow if states delay or abandon retail competition. As wholesale markets are deregulated and RTOs begin operating, the prudence principles that state regulators have used for many years may have to be changed. For example, if FERC and RTO monitors determine that deregulated wholesale markets operate fairly, prices derived from those markets must be considered reasonable. If so, these costs should be allowed into state-regulated retail rates without regard to the prudence principles state regulators have used for years. Therefore, utilities' traditional burden of proving costs are or are not justifiable shifts to regulators. 2. Reduced investor confidence -- Prior to deregulation, stringent prudence review and disallowance of generation costs in the rate base made regulatory risk largely uncontrollable, killing IOU interests in most new investment. A major purpose of deregulation was to create an environment in which risk could be managed, but California's political and regulatory environment provides only a limited ability to manage risks. The confidence and perceptions needed to support investment decision-making will be slow to return given the approach of the state to remedy the crisis. 3. Contributing factor in economic softening -- Uncertain energy reliability and higher costs can drive-out marginal businesses, cause healthy companies to constrain expansion, and lead new entrants to question whether to make new investments. As such, an extended energy crisis contributes to inflation pressures and may slow economic growth. 4. Increased pressure on the Western grid -- Even as capacity increases and demand reductions work to resolve the California crisis, these solutions have long-term implications for the Western Grid. These include a realistic possibility of California becoming an ""energy island"" as a result of near-term reduction in available regional resources for export to California; increased emphasis on security control to protect against overall Western grid failure as sub-regions have problems; RTO requirements to strengthen locally available supplies to bolster overall system reliability; longer-term development of new plants using plentiful coal resources and clean coal technology will alter the pattern of imports into California; and the emergence of Mexico as a major supplier to southern California and Arizona, contributing to a bifurcation of the Western Grid into northern and southern markets. 5. Unbundling failures that push companies back to portfolio strategies -- For California investor-owned utilities, unbundling has achieved neither the least-cost solution sought by regulators nor value maximization targeted by investors. This necessitates a reevaluation of portfolio management strategies potentially involving generation, transmission, power trading and marketing, and retail businesses in multiple geographies serving multiple markets. 6. Ineffectiveness in changing siting and development restrictions -- California's retail price caps and multiple explanations for the crisis have left accelerated siting processes and environmental standards changes open to challenge by various interests. In addition, limiting application of new siting orders only to small generators contributes to uncertainty and investor hesitancy. 7. Procurement management that alters user-utility negotiating leverage -- Competitive markets compel participants -- suppliers, marketers, large industrial buyers, etc. -- to strategically manage procurement as a critical value-driver. Because risk is explicitly shared and always has the potential of shifting advantage to either seller or buyer, the sophistication of negotiations and contracts increases as competitive markets evolve. 8. Increased emphasis on distributed generation and new technologies -- California's reliability and price challenges have triggered a re-emergence of energy crisis measures from the 1970s. End-users are investing in solutions they control, and the distributed generation market is being aggressively developed among large retailers, industrial users and residential customers. This makes possible the development of microgrids connecting consumers in local areas and related changes in traditional grid systems, from modifications in interconnection agreements to changing definitions of reserve margins and system reliability. Industry Executives' Response Senior executives from sixteen non-California utilities with a combined market capitalization over $120 billion and $145 billion in revenues responded to an Andersen survey with their views of the implications of the California power crisis for their companies and for the industry. The survey, conducted between February 19, 2001 and March 2, 2001 by Knowledge Systems &amp; Research, Inc. of Syracuse, found that the companies are observing the California situation carefully, expect a slowing -- but not a turnaround -- of deregulation, and believe their internal plans and preparations are on-target for the changing environment: -- Deregulation -- Nearly all executives believe recent California events will slow the pace of deregulation over the next five years for states that have not begun or finished writing restructuring legislation. None believe that it will cause advanced states to re-regulate markets, although many states will review their legislation to assess their risk of duplicating California's current situation and make any changes necessary to avoid it. -- National legislation -- Few executives suggest the situation will initiate national energy policy/legislation; others believe it will be a continuing issue but, because of state-to-state variances, Congress will be unable to pass any comprehensive measures or force states to a restructuring timeline. Some expect additional state-level legislation. -- Company strategies -- Most do not see any changes to their business models or strategies for generation, distribution or supply procurement as a response to the situation in California. However, many have expanded their risk management programs, reduced spot market purchases, begun emphasizing long-term supply contracts, planning new power generation capacity, and started hedging with futures trades. Those facing price caps are rethinking their stance on them. -- Investor scrutiny -- Many executives indicate their shareholders are aware of the situation and investors -- particularly institutional investors -- are more heavily scrutinizing their actions. Many say news coverage has prompted retail, commercial and industrial customer skepticism of industry restructuring. -- Transmission deregulation -- Many executives agree the California situation will increase interest in FERC's regional transmission organizations (RTO) deregulation effort. Utility Company Action Items Both to guard against a sudden California cascade and as a potentially powerful competitive thrust, forward-thinking utilities should bolster their basic preparedness with a variety of tactics -- or inoculations -- specifically aimed to combat a potential California power virus, according to Andersen partner Mark Moskovitz: -- Improve procurement management and risk management capabilities -- To manage exposure to volatile supply and demand shifts, organizations must be sure that comprehensive and clear supply procedures, controls, decision points, risk limits and communications are in place. -- Plan and design innovative rate and pricing structures -- Companies and regulators must focus on communicating price signals that create value for both the customer and the provider. Innovative rate and pricing structures that more closely tie the customer's price to the real cost of supply will better signal the value of the service as well as providing more accurate information upon which both end user and supplier can make decisions. -- Increase emphasis on demand side management (DSM) strategies -- In addition to new pricing strategies to help achieve and maintain supply-demand equilibrium, companies must now focus on employing more extensive and innovative demand side management programs. These programs may offer significant benefits with limited risk to both the customer and energy supplier. -- Assess the supply and generation dynamics in adjacent jurisdictions -- Companies must take a broader view -- beyond typical geographic market definitions -- of the economics of generation and related business decisions in an increasingly volatile market in which supply will follow the best prices. -- Develop contingency plans for the continued deferral of new generation capacity -- In the face of potential ongoing generation capacity shortages, companies and regulators must be prepared to move with a portfolio of strategies to meet demand, including for example DSM, flexible pricing and distributed generation. In addition, they should explore efficiency-improving upgrades to existing facilities and seize any opportunity to accelerate near-term construction plans. -- Proactively address potential organizational disruption -- As regulatory and economic changes continue to churn the industry waters and companies adjust and/or restructure, they must be highly cogniscent of, sensitive to, and directly address employees' concerns with information about the company's future and theirs'. Industry/Regulatory Lessons There are also a number of broad primary lessons the electric power industry -- nationally and internationally -- should take away from its first major domestic test case in deregulation and restructuring, according to Andersen principal David O. Jermain: -- Simplify market design. -- Build a continuing role for regulators. -- Maintain communications with multiple constituent interests. -- Prepare contingency plans for extreme stress conditions. -- Couple real-time retail pricing with transparently priced wholesale competition. -- Provide special incentives for RTO investment, formation and development. -- Break down regulatory and political barriers to market signals and responses.

The first warm spell of the season is expected to cause temperatures to jump 10 degrees, leading to a 2,000 megawatt increase in electricity consumption -- the equivalent of two large power plants. The week started out with a peak demand of 28,835 megawatts, but by tomorrow it is forecasted to top 30,500 megawatts. This comes as hydroelectricity resources (both Northwest and California) run low, more than 10,000 megawatts of power plants remain off line due to planned and unplanned maintenance, and some 3,000 megawatts of Qualifying Facilities or alternative energy suppliers are not operating. The California ISO's renewed call for conservation precedes a forecast of 90 degree highs in the inland areas that may tempt many Californians to flip on air conditioners. For conservation tips -- such as using fans instead of air conditioners, setting thermostat at 78 degrees, etc. -- please see the California ISO's web site www.caiso.com. New Notification System: With a challenging summer around the corner, the California ISO wants to do all it can to bring information to the public as quickly as possible. For that reason, a new notification system is being brought on line. Media and the public can now access the Internet to keep current if rotating blackouts are issued. Navigation: Visit www.caiso.com Click on System Conditions for current information on rotating outages (will appear only when activated) For previous outage information (last hour, etc.), click on Market Notices, scroll to bottom of page and click on Notice Log The California ISO is also testing a new service to notify newsrooms immediately by email should the ISO initiate electrical emergencies (Stage One - Three) or rotating outages. If you would like to participate, please email kwerst@caiso.com with a maximum of one email address per newsroom. Additionally, a single on-call media pager number has been established: 916/815-0679. To make it easier on media, ISO Communications will no longer be posting on-call schedules for media spokespersons on the web site. Simply call the on-call pager after hours. News releases alerting the media to electrical emergencies will continue, as will news conferences held on-site in Folsom and via telephone. As a reminder, if you wish to visit the ISO control rooms (in Folsom or Alhambra) always call ISO Communications first at 888/516-NEWS to make an appointment. Access to the control rooms may be limited on certain days, depending on system conditions and/or level of requests from media.

"Burlington: PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION. Lorraine, here are a few notes from my review of the Val Verde contract, and my initial impressions. Let's talk more about how to approach the issue after we meet with Ron tomorrow about MAOP. 12/31/92 Interconnect Agreement: Sec. 1.3 specifies pressures and states that unless there is an agreement to provide firm compression service TW will accept up to 200,000 on an interruptible basis. Sec. 2 states that the Blanco Hub MAOP shall not be exceeded. Sec. 4.2 limits damages (no consequential damages). The contract also has a fairly standard force majeure clause. 2/18/93 letter amendment: Sec. 3 obligates TW to provide firm compression service in order to accept 200,000 into TW's system (provided MOGI has pressure of at least 650 and quantity of at least 140). Acknowledges that this is an agreement to provide firm compression in accordance with Sec. 1.3 of 12/92 agreement. 9/25/95 letter amendment: Increases quantity to be received at the interconnect to 250,000 once the San Juan expansion is effective. My initial conclusions: It is pretty clear we have an obligation to accept 250,000 on a firm basis, provided that Burlington complies with the pressure requirements. Probably the only way we can avoid this obligation is if accepting 250,000 would cause us to exceed the hub MAOP. In that case we can argue impossibility of performance. Also, we could avoid the obligation because the summer heat above certain temperatures constitutes force majeure. This argument is strengthened by the fact that temperatures seem to have gotten hotter over the years. The fact that we entered into our most recent agreement with Burlington in January of this year weakens the credibility of our arguments (they will say we should have known by now). Burlington might try to argue that we have an absolute obligation to comply with the agreement, even if it means expensive system modifications. That argument is not a very strong one because the agreement contains no such affirmative obligation and in fact quite clearly describes the facilities that are the subject of the agreement.",0

In ERCOT, Enron is in support of nodal pricing. I would not go so far as to say we are pushing for PJM's implementation, however, but for a market with nodal prices (and unilateral bids - aka unbalanced schedules, congestion reflect by price differentials, etc). I was unaware PJM had such great power to alter bids. This is something we don't want, and something for which I am not aware we have advocated. Perhaps in Enron's promotion of locational prices, it has been retold as PJM-style locational prices. Given that PJM is the most commonly cited example of locational prices, it does not surprise me to have the sloppiness in discussions that could lead to the rumors.

Vince -----Original Message----- From: ""Frank A. Wolak"" <wolak@zia.Stanford.EDU>@ENRON Sent: Friday, October 19, 2001 4:28 PM To: Kaminski, Vince J Subject: Vince, I've been hearing rumors that Enron has decided to endorse the nodal pricing model as implemented in PJM. I just wanted to warn you that I'm not sure this is in Enron's long-term interest at all. Let me explain why. Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talk more about this. First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing and specifically pricing congestion. However, the way that PJM implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility and reduce the transparency of the market. Specifically, the PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a %10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems is out of merit in one of the three zones in region. (The fact that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.) Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting software to compute new nodal prices. The way I have (somewhat unfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the PJM ISO decides what prices it would like for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them. This is not a transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buy the risk management services that Enron provides. The only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area to meet demand. Under these circumstances, you need to pay the imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market. However, bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on the East Coast. This will effectively mean little imports to the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated at the discretion of the ISO. Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-service mitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility. It effectively kills off the development of risk management at the wholesale and retail level. Power marketing becomes much less profitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigated prices. In short, the PJM model is not market. It is just an alternative form of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces price volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just get a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-service regulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-service mitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-service prices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators. As we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sources of benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-side involved in the market and from more efficient risk management. A necessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect actual conditions in the market (including the extent of market power exercised). Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market participants to make the investment necessary to management. The PJM model is just way to have a market in name without achieving any significant benefits to consumers or energy traders. Frank",0

"FW: Southern, Regulators clash in Power grid fight. Very interesting article. -----Original Message----- From: Nersesian, Carin Sent: Wednesday, October 10, 2001 4:21 PM To: Robertson, Linda; Shelk, John; Shortridge, Pat Subject: Southern, Regulators clash in Power grid fight Atlanta Journal and Constitution October 10, 2001, Wednesday Copyright 2001 Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News Copyright 2001 The Atlanta Journal and Constitution Atlanta Journal and Constitution October 10, 2001, Wednesday KR-ACC-NO: AT-ENERGY LENGTH: 718 words HEADLINE: Southern Co., Regulators Clash in Power-Grid Fight BYLINE: By Matthew C. Quinn BODY: Southern Co. appears to be on the verge of losing a big-money power struggle over control of its four-state electricity transmission system. But both sides in the tug-of-war offer different takes on which result would help consumers and which would hurt them. At issue are long-distance transmission lines, mounted on huge steel towers, that carry electricity across state lines to towns and cities. Atlanta-based Southern Co. has invested $ 3 billion in its 26,000-mile system, but federal regulators want it to cede control to a larger agency that covers eight states. The matter is coming to a head now after three years of wrangling. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission wants to carve up the country into four regional transmission organizations, or RTOs, for the Southeast, Northeast, Midwest and West. Under such a plan, local utilities like Southern would be unable to stop competing power shipments from out-of-state suppliers. Regional transmission organizations ""yield significant customer savings,"" said FERC Chairman Pat Wood III. Commission spokeswoman Barbara Connors said lower rates will result when barriers to competitively priced electricity from outside the region are dropped and transmission costs reduced. But there are sharp differences of opinion on that score. Andy Dearman, Southern Co.'s chief transmission officer, cites estimates that a super-regional agency could cost more than $ 100 million to establish, and he says those costs could be passed on to consumers in the form of higher rates. According to Georgia Power Co., a Southern Co. subsidiary, transmission costs already account for about 6.5 percent of Georgia electricity bills. There's also a question of reliability when a new system is established, Dearman saud. ""It impacts the ability to keep the lights on,"" he said. Some state regulators, who stand to lose regulatory control, see a Washington power grab. ""We've got low prices and a reliable system,"" said Georgia Public Service Commissioner Stan Wise, who sees a back-door move toward utility deregulation of the sort that has failed with electricity in California and been severely tested with natural gas in Georgia. ""Don't tell me about the new system when I've got blood on my face from the last battle,"" Wise said. ""There are some parallels that make us squirm."" PSC Chairman Lauren ""Bubba"" McDonald wrote President Bush following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks urging a delay. ""This is not the time to consider or implement any change to the management of the nation's transmission grid,"" he said. But the federal commission has only toughened its position. Wood, a Texan recently named chairman by Bush, said last month he wants to use the commission's authorities as a ""stick"" to force reluctant utilities into line. Wood would deny utilities that refuse to join a ""new world"" of regional power grids by Dec. 15 the authority to charge deregulated prices and delay merger approvals for those firms. The commission plans a series of workshops in Washington next week for what Wood called the ""brightest minds available"" in the utility field to brainstorm over transmission reorganization plans. Southern Co. is sending a representative. Companies like Enron Corp., the Texas-based national energy suppler, are pressing for RTOs as the first step toward a national transmission grid -- a concept favored by the Bush administration. Prodded by federal regulators, Southern Co. in June agreed to dilute its control over the 26,000-mile system by joining with public power agencies in five states to form a larger, 39,000-mile transmission agency to be operated by an outside company. But a federal mediator rejected the plan. The issue has also split Southern Co. from onetime subsidiary Mirant Corp., an independent power company with plans to expand into the Southeast. Large regional grids are ""more cost-effective and reliable"" than the present territorial hodgepodge, said Mirant spokesman Buddy Eller. By encouraging development of new and cleaner power plants, the environment would benefit too, he added. But Wise called such predictions ""totally unproven.""

Such a program (with appropriate measures to address local concerns) would provide significant public health benefits even as we increase electricity supplies. Establish mandatory reduction targets to emissions of three main pollutants: sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury. Phase in reductions over a reasonable period of time, similar to the successful acid rain reduction program established by the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act.

"Comments On Draft RTO Letter On Barton Proposal. Following up on last night's e-mail, here are some specific suggestions to strengthen the draft EPSA letter on the Barton RTO draft. The second paragraph and the first few bullets after it should be rewritten as follows to make it clear that the current legislative proposal on RTOs is far off the mark as opposed to being fixed by ""technical corrections"" as the draft letter now states: You have identified RTOs as critical to the development of a well-functioning transmission system, and we wholeheartedly agree. We commend you for including all transmission-owning utilities in the RTO provisions and for requiring that transmission be conducted on an open-access basis. However, to accomplish the RTO and transmission goals we share, it is essential that any legislation on RTOs not slow down the process already underway at FERC. Unfortunately, the discussion draft as issued on October 9th does not meet this test. Specifically, the proposal Establishes a lengthy and cumbersome process that will delay the formation of RTOs by imposing procedural requirements that advantage those who oppose properly functioning RTOs, including evidentiary hearings and court appeals review under standards of judicial review not normally applicable to Federal Power Act cases. Removes the ability of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to deal with an evolving marketplace by statutorily freezing market and operational structures in place as of date of enactment regardless of changed circumstances. [rest of the bullets as in the draft letter] We appreciate the opportunity to offer these suggestions to strengthen the draft letter. Please call with any questions or comments before the Legislative Affairs Committee meeting tomorrow. Thanks. John",5

"Fwd: Portland Consultant's Investigation Finds California Has Capacity for Electricity Needs. FYI Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable Date: Tue, 17 Oct 2000 08:53:16 -0500 From: ""Tracey Bradley"" <tbradley@bracepatt.com> To: ""Deanna King"" <dking@bracepatt.com>, ""Paul Fox"" <pfox@bracepatt.com>, ""Ronald Carroll"" <rcarroll@bracepatt.com> Subject: Portland Consultant's Investigation Finds California Has Capacity for Electricity Needs Mime-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII Content-Disposition: inline FYI - It sounds like this consultant's findings are being questioned by many in the industry, including by the CAISO. Portland, Ore.-Based Firm Says California Has Capacity for Electricity Needs Dan McSwain , North County Times, Escondido, Calif. ( October 17, 2000 ) Oct. 13--PORTLAND, Ore.--A private investigation of state power markets has come to the conclusion that California had plenty of electricity generating capacity this summer. The state enjoyed a 32 percent reserve margin even as wholesale prices soared and the state's power manager declared 36 separate ""power emergencies"" because California was thought to be in the grips of a critical shortage, according to the investigation. The author of the investigation's preliminary report, Portland-based economist and utility industry consultant Robert McCullough, said at a conference of analysts, power traders and electricity industry regulators Thursday that he has found evidence that generators and trading companies manipulated the production of power from June through August to create a false shortage and push up prices. The Encina power plant in Carlsbad provides a stark example: it ran at well below its full capacity for much of June, even though wholesale power prices ---- and consumer electricity bills ---- shot to well above the generating plant's cost of production. The actual production of electricity by the plants was determined by an analysis of data from the Environmental Protection Agency, which monitors emissions. ""We are seeing a lot of under-generation,"" McCullough said. ""This is market power in action."" Market power is a term used by economists to describe the ability of market participants -- in this case suppliers -- to influence prices. Many of the industry experts present at the conference Thursday reaffirmed their belief that supply shortages were very real this summer, and contributed to high prices, but several participants said deregulation has reduced the amount of market information that is available to analysts. Mainstream economists have questioned the accuracy of data from federal agencies, including the EPA. Conventional explanations for the low energy production observed in San Diego County are scant. Encina's operators, a joint venture of energy giants Dynegy Inc. and NRG Energy Inc. called Cabrillo Power, confirmed that the power plant had no abnormal maintenance problems. The San Diego Regional Air Quality Board said Wednesday that the power plant was well within its state-mandated pollution limits. But David Lloyd, the corporate secretary of Cabrillo, denied that the Encina plant has been used to game the San Diego County power markets. ""That can't possibly be right,"" Lloyd said of McCullough's analysis. ""In North County, we were right on the ragged edge of being off (an emergency shutdown because of heavy output). ""Without knowing the specific details of time and which units were on or off, I can't comment,"" Lloyd said. ""We certainly don't want to be accused of anything wrongful,"" he said. ""We don't have that much power in California, and for us to be shutting down in California to push up the price somewhere else doesn't make sense for us. We want to run all we can when the prices are high."" Electricity prices have soared to record levels since May, resulting in a doubling and tripling of power bills this summer for the 1.2 million customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Co. and causing an estimated $5 billion in losses for Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. State lawmakers have intervened on behalf of San Diego County consumers with a retail rate cap, but the law in turn created a looming IOU that could grow beyond $300 million if high wholesale prices persist. No fewer than five private, state and federal investigations are under way to assess the competitiveness of power markets in the interconnected Western states. The investigations also seek to answer charges that the companies which produce and trade electricity have either figured out how to exploit deregulated markets to outmaneuver regulators or have engaged in outright manipulation in order to increase profits. Inquiries by the California Public Utilities Commission, Electricity Oversight Board and attorney general, along with a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission investigation, were launched in July and August. Staff investigators of the state and federal commissions said this week that they are still in the process of issuing subpoenas and gathering market data. McCullough was hired in late May by the Seattle city utility and a consortium of large industrial power consumers in the Pacific Northwest to investigate the price spikes. His effort is thought to be the first to complete an exhaustive analysis of state and federal information that tracks the amount of electricity that was available and compares it to the amount of power that was actually used. Chief among McCullough's findings was that demand for power was lower this summer than what was forecasted by the Western Systems Coordinating Council, a federal agency that is charged with ensuring the stability of the vast web of power transmission lines that connect California to 13 other Western states, British Columbia and northern Mexico. McCullough provided a copy of his preliminary findings Tuesday to the North County Times, and the initial reaction of the state's energy community was one of deep skepticism. ""EPA data is notoriously unreliable,"" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford professor and the chairman of the market surveillance committee of the California Independent System Operator, the agency that manages the state grid and which has paid enormous sums for emergency power this summer. To gauge the actual output of power plants that burn fossil fuel, McCullough used emissions data from the EPA. ""Greed would get the best of anybody,"" Wolak said. ""I found a lot of hours where in-state generators were exceeding nameplate capacity. These guys were cranking it out."" Wolak, in a study of power markets for the system operator, did conclude, however, that exercise of market power by power generators and traders was the major cause of higher prices this summer. At the conference in Portland, most of the panelists did not openly criticize McCullough's analysis, but implicitly disputed his conclusions by attributing higher prices and the presumed exercise of market power to a very real shortage of electricity generating capacity among the Western states. Low hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest and high temperatures in the Southwest were blamed for limiting California's ability to import electricity. Others said state and federal regulators, along with market participants themselves, won't really know what happened until more experts look at hard market information that is in short supply. Ron Eachus, the chairman of the Oregon Public Utilities Commission, said market information is routinely withheld from regulators, the public and buyers of electricity, but is shared among power generators and trading companies. ""If the market is sharing it with themselves, but not us, I don't buy that,"" Eachus said. Tim Belden is the vice president of West Trading for Enron North America, the largest marketer and trader of electricity in the world. Enron takes the unique stand that more information which has been labeled ""proprietary"" by companies, such as when a plant is being run and how much the electricity is selling for, should be made available instantly to the markets. ""Is there a smoking gun out there or are market participants behaving rationally?"" Belden said. ""California is characterized by secret, black box market models that nobody understands,"" he said. ""If you've got nothing to hide, release the data."" ----- To see more of the North County Times, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.nctimes.com (c) 2000, North County Times, Escondido, Calif.

"Ken Lay Mention At NRSC Reception Last Night. Last night I attended the National Republican Senatorial Committee's reception at Senator Frist's home in DC. (Frist is the NRSC chairman this cycle.) Enron, including Jeff and Linda, had been invited to the reception, the purpose of which was to introduce ex-RNC chairman Haley Barbour as the NRSC's National Finance Chairman. Present were over a dozen Republican senators, including Minority Leader Lott, Whip Nickles, and Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison, Bunning (KY), Fitzgerald (IL), Cochran (MS), Inhofe (OK), Bond (MO), Crapo (ID), Voinovich (OH), Allen (VA), and Chafee (RI). The ""news"" from our perspective is that Haley Barbour singled out Ken Lay for praise as the first person to step to the plate and agree to help with their new ""Majority Makers"" program. This is the effort that Barbour will head up to raise $21 million for this election cycle by concentrating on events outside DC that would target businesses and business leaders without a DC presence. Barbour said that Ken had agreed to organize and chair a Houston fundraiser to raise $1 million toward the $21 million total. Ken was the first name he mentioned. The only others were the DeVos family in Michigan and Julie Finley, a major GOP fundraiser based in DC. Needless to say, I was suddenly quite ""popular"" after Haley made his remarks to the assembled group. Haley said he looked forward to working with us on this project. As you know from a previous e-mail, Pat Shortridge had earlier seen our mutual friend Mitch Bainwol, the executive director of the NRSC, who had told Pat at lunch last week that Haley had spoken with Ken, but last night was the first I had heard a dollar figure -- and a big one at that -- linked to the effort. While it was not stated, I assume from the location and size of the event's goal that the President would be involved (but this is only an educated assumption on my part). Later I saw Karen Hughes of the White House staff, but I do not think she was present when Haley made his comments.",0

"Report On EPSA Legislative Affairs Committee Meeting. The EPSA leg. affairs cmt. met today during the fall meeting. The speakers were Howard Useem, Republican counsel to the Senate Energy Committee, and Jimmy Glotfelty, senior policy advisory to the Secretary of Energy. Useem said Senate Energy Committee Republicans were meeting later this morning to finalize their energy proposal. (We later learned that they opted against including any electricity provisions, not even the PURPA, PUHCA and reliability issues that Howard thought might be included when he spoke before the senators met; this is good news since it makes it less likely that anti-FERC provisions will be added.) (Howard said now is the best time to legislative on electricity because the Supreme Court has not yet acted on the bundling/unbundling issue.) On RTOs, in some what of a surprise, Useem said that there is general support among Senate Republicans for RTOs, including consolidating them into a few RTOs of large scope (surprising since this is not what we have heard in meetings with individual Senate offices). While he said that, he also said that support is stronger in the abstract than in specifics. He said the biggest opposition was coming from very vocal state regulators (EPSA staff did a good job of pointing to state regulators, mainly in the Midwest, who support larger RTOs). Most importantly, Howard said none of the senators on his committee take a ""not over my dead body"" approach to RTOs. Jimmy Glotfelty explained to several EPSA members who asked questions just why it is that the Administration wants Congress to be silent on RTOs. He said while they would prefer a sentence or two affirming FERC's authority, they do not believe this is what would come out of the legislative process. They are not willing to run that risk. He stressed that the president wants to include other electricity issues. He said they were very close to an agreement with Western governors on regional transmission siting. Jimmy further said that the Administration also wants silence on incentive rates, another issue where FERC can act now. They continue to talk to Barton and his staff in an attempt to get them to back away from the restrictive approach to RTOs in the Barton discussion draft. (He said Pat Wood spent several hours with Barton and other House committee staff yesterday.) Of concern, Jimmy said something like ""could be 4 RTOs, could be 8 RTOs,"" what is important is getting standard design. He also said DOE will make sure that PMAs are included in RTOs.",0

I still think I need to talk to FERC staff before we file. Here's why: - - FERC, as you know, is about to issue a new rule on market-based rate eligibility. - - In the meantime, they've been kicking out a very high percentage of MBR applicants for trumped up reasons. I.e., issuing deficiency letters on issues we know they don't care about. I think the real reason is they don't want to issue a lot of approvals until the new rule comes out. - - No matter how perfect our filing is, we're liable to get kicked out, too. They might not want to give MBR to a new Enron entity until they see the new rule. - - The best way to deal with that is to sit down with staff, go over the draft page by page, and see what more they want. But that would take too long, because of staff's schedule. - - The second best way is for me to call Dan Larcamp or Mike Coleman, at FERC; tell them that we're not in a huge hurry, but we really don't want a deficiency letter; read him the language in the draft about how we'll comply with the new rule, and see if that's good enough. If he suggests different language, we'll have to put it in there. - - Alternatively, if we really want to try to slide this through without saying anything to FERC in advance, we can file it, and just hope that the language we have about complying with the new rule is good enough. But that's really not what I would recommend. If we do decide to call FERC, I could call right away, and probably get an answer in time to file today. If not, then certainly tomorrow. Otherwise, we're pretty much ready. 2. I really do think that we could ask for 30 days without raising any eyebrows.

FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, t= he commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of= all questions. There was a general consensus that standards were needed; = much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seeme= d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo= rward and how far they needed to go. Panelists urged the need to mover for= ward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha= t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t= o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward. There was d= iscussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the= reins in the future. On an interesting tangential note, there was noticea= ble conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two org= anizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20 =20 FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne= eded from the Commission. Staffers probed all panelists to find what they = felt was critical. =20 The first major topic was ""How many RTOs? What is their scope?"" All panel= ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b= y FERC, in strong definitive language. N o one offered any specific langua= ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement. The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?"" Panelists varie= d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent. Some urged f= or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta= ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (= followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre= nt situation. The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha= t the industry needed to move forward. They continually visited this topic= throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue = a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you= need us to provide?"" General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they = wanted strong leadership in this areas. Kormos and Burkes went so far as t= o say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a= little further."" Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu= t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t= he need for cautious investigation. =20 One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc= heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th= e ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the que= stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design. Korm= os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying = a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry. The se= ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following = questions: ? Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu= r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i= s nonetheless efficient? Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there= be others that must be accommodated? ? Transmission Service - Are transmission services required to sch= edule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect= ing from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are a= llowed)?=20 ? Loop Flows - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission = services appropriate? If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues= to be addressed? ? Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr= ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti= re those contracts? Are there other solutions? ? Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?= Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)= , be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche= dules), or will they be required at all? ? Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed = in standard ways? Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary= services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina= ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)? ? Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? = Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce= ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical= ly unwieldy? ? Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate= d into the new world? Should systems be designed with the assumption that = non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO? Or should they be designed to t= reat each NJE as a separate entity? Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica= l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which = to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions= , pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will t= ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financi= al hedging instruments"") will take only months. The Commission asked Mike = about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible = to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed. Now for a funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer= red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati= on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest. Kormos flat out= said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't = believe that that statement is true."" He then backpedaled a bit and said t= hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert= ion by the Northwest interests was false. NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se= tting organization. Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a bea= uty contest between NERC and GISB?"" Cook and Boswell then went into severa= l short polite jabs at each other's organizations. Other participants cont= inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization. Interesting= ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI= SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and= did not focus on its history. Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a= sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were= they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?). GISB was easily a= ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin= g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin= t, Brownell. Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m= an. He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos= ed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag. If staffers have tenure, they will = likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulti= ng in several filings and interventions. We may also wish to file comments= in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show= the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction. There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues= , but general consensus was that I could not be done. There was also some = talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB. The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur= ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade= rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward. NERC s= omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position. In general, I would= say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top. Let me know if you have any questions.

"Re: Andrew Lundquist. Your assessment makes perfect sense to me. What do you think about having Nels make the call to Lundquist just to find out what his status is, what he might look for when his current assignment is over, etc. (obviously without identifying us -- presumably Nels would have reason to talk to him anyway in the normal course of business)? I am not wedded to the idea but am inclined toward at least getting the information, unless you see a problem. Linda Robertson 03/13/2001 02:16 PM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: Andrew Lundquist I got your message about Andrew. He would be an excellent catch. However, I see a couple of significant problems. My guess is that Andrew is too senior for this position, particularly after having chaired the Cheney task force. Also, I would not anticipate that he would be available for several months, if then. We should fill this position immediately. We are already missing opportunities because this position is vacant. As for our search, using Korn Ferry, I have narrowed the field to two very good candidates. I am setting up time for Rick to interview these candidates next Monday. The first candidate is Drew Maloney with Rep. Tom Delay's office. Drew would give us enormous visibility in House Republican leadership circles, seems trustworthy, and capable of learning most of the substance of the energy portfolio. Drew has strong networking skills, which I think would nicely fit with Tom's strategic and technical skills. The second candidate is John Shelk, whom I have known for nearly 15 years. John was the lead Republican staff on the House Energy and Commerce Committee under Norm Lent. John left the Committee in 1992. Since then John has worked in the financial services and gaming industries, where he has enhanced his political and Republican networking skills. John in very short order would have extremely strong technical skills, atlhough he has been away from the industry for eight years. I believe both candidates bring different but very strong talents to the job. I have a second opening for an enviromental advocate. I am discussing with Rick the possibility of whether we could redirect one of these candidates (probably John) to that slot. That said, please let me know if I should have Nels pursue Andrew.",4
"Fantastic Article in wash post on Refunds. - California Changes Stance on Refunds Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks By Peter Behr Washington Post Staff Writer Friday, July 6, 2001; Page E01 California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity, saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis. ""We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get us $8.9 billion,"" Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. ""You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion."" The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close to the negotiations. Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise. ""What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood,"" Wagner told reporters. ""In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment."" The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday. Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California's largest utility, drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn, chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said. Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides, is closed to the public and media. Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a ""joke"" that the parties might as well wear ""clown suits,"" according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks. But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said. Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure, some energy analysts believe. Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals. California's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile ""spot market"" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so did the state's electricity bills. In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy analysts say. A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a ""refund"" because the deals were reached ""under commercial duress,"" according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. ""There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be,"" said Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a ""just and reasonable"" standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. ""It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate,"" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid. Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room ""billions of dollars apart,"" as the talks approached their final weekend, sources said. , 2001 The Washington Post Company",0
"FW: Possible co-sponsorships. All, Lee asked me to forward this. I'm still awaiting additional suggestions from anyone on speakers. I guess Lee's e-mail changes things.

As for the Frank Wolak suggestion, Frank is a Stanford economist who is an outstanding analyst and has published probably more than anyone else on electricity market design performance, regarding the UK, Australia, and California.

"Re: Daily Update/ Legislative activity - 08/24/00. I attended Cmmr. Wood's two-day hearing on Wholesale Markets, which concluded today (8/24) in San Diego. Three Commissioner's were present (Wood, Lynch and Neeper) with Duque and Bilas participating by phone. Administrative Law Judge Wetzel was present and a transcript was taken. The quasi-legislative hearing was the beginning of a record developed for the investigation into the workings of wholesale/retail markets. This session focused on Wholesale markets. There will be subsequent sessions on retail issues, market structure and other related issues in the future. My conclusion from this session is that Wood is looking for support for increasing regulatory intervention in the market. Dan Larcamp, Director of the Office of markets, Tariffs and Rates, FERC, was present. He relayed FERC's concern of this matter and a desire to hold hearings in San Diego. He also relayed that Hoecker held a press conference announcing the opening of a 206 investigative proceeding into the operation of the wholesale markets in California, which carried with it refund authority. The format of the hearing was to respond to pre-filed questions developed by Wood/Lynch. Each member of the panel would respond to the questions and any questions posed by the Commissioners, the Judge or the CPUC Attorney. No questions were posed by members of the audience. Yesterday's panel of academics were comprised of: 1. Dr. Timothy Duane-UC Berkley 2. Dr. William Hogan-Harvard 3. Dr. Frank Wolak-Stanford (ISO Market Surveillance Committee) 4. David Marcus-Energy Consultant for the Coaltion of Utility Employees 5. Dr. Gene Coyle 6. Dr. Jean-Michel Glachant, Universite Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne The panel was asked to speak as individuals and not on behalf of any institutions they may represent. While the purpose of the panel seemed to be to determine that market power was being exercised and that prices were too high and therefore not just and reasonable, the panelist stopped short of blaming generators and market participants in behaving illegally. The concensus generally was that market power did exist at various times, but the mere existence did not constitute bad behavior. None, with the exception of Dr. Wolak who is in the process of doing a study using recent data as part of his role for the Market Surveillance Committee, had done a study. There was some discussion, though not much, of the monopsony power of the utilities. I think ultimately the group conceded that scarcity of supply amplified concerns about the exercise of market power, as even the increase in gas costs did not fully explain the recent spikes. Wolak believes that encourage utilities to enter into forward purchases will reduce the exercise of real-time market power. Hogan seemed to be there with Sempra's interests in mind. He continued to promote expansion of the ISO's abilities to dispatch load as well as maintain system reliability. There was alot of discussion about forward purchase ability for utilities so as to be less subject to volatile market prices. The concerns were also discussed about the appropriateness of a distribution utility making purchasing decisions on behalf of its customers. This included discussion of separation of these functions and the default provider role. Most everyone agreed that rolling back to a regulated market was not feasible without raising other major and serious concerns, however there seemed to be support for some interim measures where cost-of-service regulation may be a good idea and that was during peak periods. All agreed that a demand response, and price signals, are important in the long-run, although not to the extent currently experienced in San Diego. Today's panel included representatives from SDG&E, SCE and PG&E, TURN, UCAN and ORA. While yesterday's panel maintained objectivity as to whether or not generators were exercising market power to the detriment of the system, today's panel made no bones about the generators being to blame. SCE/PG&E indicated their need for relief for recovery of market costs in excess of the rate freeze. SDG&E was still on the hot seat for their inaction in hedging any of their supply. SDG&E brought up their failed PBR proposal and ORA and UCAN thought that that may be one way to incent the utility to be more responsible with their purchases. UCAN discussed the Governor's direction and the potential for putting rate caps into affect for residential and small commercial. He mentioned that C&I customers are experience difficulties as well. TURN raised the need for cost-based bid caps and cost-based peaking contracts. Mike Florio, TURN, urged against any further divestitute of assets and alleged market concentration on those assets that had been divested. In fact, TURN urged the Commission to seek legislation to clarify the Commission's authority to order retention of assets. Neeper urged that part of the solution should be changing the current requirement to use the PX as the only authorized exchange, although TURN disagreed.

Good new - The Williamson Act passed the Senate 34-1, It should be heard at the assembly Saturday or Monday if it is not redirected to a Committee hearing. 2. There was a long meeting with Ducheny with regards to AB 970. The enviro's boycotted, they want to draft a bill with Keeley. Labor was obstructionist - they wanted to gut all the expediting siting language with regards to all facilities except for the peaking plants. Rate Cap related bills 1. The Edison Language on Rate Stabilization may not go anywhere. Edison has not found an author because of the efforts of Enron and others lobbying against it. Furthermore there are signs that Gov. Davis opposes it. 2. The Governor's office has issued a proposed language for a rate cap bill. The language however is not available as of yet. It may be released today or tomorrow. SDG&E has shown concerns over the content of the bill. They seem to think that it is worse than initially proposed by the Governor in his press release. The bill includes retroactive rate caps through 6/1/00. The rate cap could reflect Wood's rate cap proposal (6.5 cts cap on the energy component The bill does not specify who or how the costs associated with the cap will be recovered. (The reasoning is that UDCs will be more cautious in their procurement if there is uncertainty on who is responsible for the costs.) All of this is speculative. We hope to see the actual language soon. 3. Enron has been working with the Republican leadership to promote a rate cap proposal similar to the amended language we have proposed for AB2290. The bill focuses only on SDG&E customers and our major principals are the following. The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to residential and small commercial customers, plus specific institutions that have a significant public role, such as schools and hospitals. The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to the period ending December 31, 2001. The Interim Rate Cap must be structured so that any undercollection is eventually recovered from the same customers who benefit from the lower rates provided by the rate cap.",0
SB 27x meeting,3
Attached is my testimony.,0
"New Congressional Report on California. Ray Alvarez brought to my attention today a news item indicating that the Congressional Budget Office released a report earlier this week entitled ""Causes and Lessons of the California Electricity Crisis."" The 30+ page report is available on the home page of the CBO's web site at www.cbo.gov. I have quickly read through the summary and it is largely favorable. For example, the summary says: ""Much of the blame for California's electricity crisis attaches to the state's restructuring plan -- but not to its objective, electricity deregulation. (...) But deregulation itself did not fail; rather, it was never achieved."" ""The restructuring plan did not remove sufficient barriers on both the supply and demand sides of the market to allow competition to work -- in part because it was not designed to."" ""Even without restructuring, California's electric utilities would have faced a difficult challenge in meeting the demand for power and holding down prices in 2000."" ""Consequently, wholesale electricity prices were higher than they probably would have been in either a traditionally regulated market or a more fully deregulated market."" ""Long-term solutions to California's electricity problems will most likely require three changes: removing barriers to the addition of generating capacity, eliminating bottlenecks in the electricity transmission system, and removing regulatory restrictions on the sale of power throughout the broad western market.""

By Kevin Yamamura Bee Capitol Bureau (Published July 6, 2001) Two more former workers from a Duke Energy power plant came forward Thursday to bolster recent claims by colleagues that the power generator withheld production to drive up prices. But Duke attributed witness accounts of fluctuating generation to instructions from the state's transmission-grid operator. Richard J. Connors, an auxiliary operator, and E. Robert Edwards, an electrician, said generation units at Duke's Chula Vista plant sat idle during emergency periods for no apparent reason. Three of their former co-workers -- two mechanics and a control room operator -- told lawmakers two weeks ago that Duke had disposed of new parts and varied its production. While that testimony drew significant attention, it was countered Monday by a report released by the state's Independent System Operator that showed the ISO had in fact ordered Duke's up-and-down output Jan. 16-18. On Thursday, the Charlotte, N.C.-based company leaned on the ISO report in its defense. ""The ISO could have dispatched those units at will,"" said Duke spokesman Tom Williams, referring to unused equipment. But Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, who has filed a lawsuit against generators, contended that the ISO had based its orders on Duke's dubious bidding history. ""These ISO orders came only after Duke had continuously manipulated the market with price-gouging schemes forcing the ISO to regulate production,"" Bustamante said. Connors and Edwards each worked more than 20 years at the South Bay plant in Chula Vista. For most of that time, the plant was owned by San Diego Gas & Electric. Two years ago, Duke purchased South Bay and retained Connors and Edwards under state-mandated agreements that ended in April. Edwards said that during power blackouts in January, he saw a 225-megawatt unit off-line. Other units, he said, were operating far below capacity. ""Our No. 1 priority in life was to make money,"" Edwards said. Williams rebutted the claims as observations from those ""who did not have the complete picture."" ""It's dead on, dead true that there are times when that plant is not running at full capacity and there is a Stage 3,"" Williams said. ""There may be blackouts in San Francisco. But the reason why it's not running is because the power can't move up Path 15 (a north-south bottleneck)."" Bustamante, however, maintained that Duke has continued to manipulate the market, calling Connors and Edwards the ""tip of the iceberg"" in the price-gouging investigation. State Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, chairman of the Senate committee investigating price manipulation, said Connors and Edwards may testify before lawmakers after further evaluation. Dunn added that his committee has talked to potential whistleblowers from other power generators who said they have seen production decreases and suspicious activities. It is undetermined whether they will testify, he said. The Bee's Kevin Yamamura can be reached at (916) 326-5542 or kyamamura@sacbee.com. Lockyer seeks SEC investigation of PG&E's financial transfers By Ed Fletcher Bee Capitol Bureau (Published July 6, 2001) State Attorney General Bill Lockyer on Thursday asked the federal Securities and Exchange Commission to scrutinize financial transfers made to PG&E Corp. from its subsidiary that has filed for bankruptcy protection. ""SEC scrutiny is essential to protect the public interest, ratepayers and the people of the state of California,"" Lockyer said in a prepared statement. Charges that PG&E Corp. hastened the bankruptcy filing of Pacific Gas and Electric Co. have been made before, responded Greg Pruett, a vice president of PG&E Corp. ""That is an issue that has been investigated multiple times by the Public Utilities Commission earlier this year, by an Assembly oversight committee, and in each of these audits there has been no conclusion that the transfers were inappropriate or that they were injurious to PG&E Co.,"" Pruett said. In its filing with the SEC, the attorney general's office said that ""without meaningful review by the SEC, it cannot be determined what impact the transfer of assets ... may have on the financial condition of the bankrupt utility."" An SEC spokesman said the commission has yet to examine the petition. Among other concerns raised by Lockyer's office is the transfer of more than $4 billion from 1997 to 1999 to PG&E Corp. from PG&E Co. The majority of the $4 billion came from the sales of PG&E power plants, as was required by deregulation. ""The bulk of the money went to pay debt that was incurred to actually build those plants,"" Pruett said. The rest of the transfers were to pay stockholder dividends, he said. PG&E filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April after having run up $6.6 billion in debt. The Bee's Ed Fletcher can be reached at (916) 326-5548 or efletcher@sacbee.com. Business; Financial Desk California State Seeks SEC Probe of PG&E Transfers NANCY RIVERA BROOKS ? 07/06/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page C-2 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer on Thursday asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate PG&E Corp. for potential abuses of its responsibilities as a utility holding company. At issue is a series of transactions over the last several years in which PG&E Corp. transferred funds from its utility, Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which now is operating under Bankruptcy Court protection. The money--more than $4 billion since 1997--flowed to the parent company and to unregulated sister companies of the utilities. The transfers have been scrutinized by the California Public Utilities Commission and the state Legislature with no finding of wrongdoing, said PG&E Corp. spokesman Greg S. Pruett. The SEC currently exempts PG&E from almost all requirements of the Public Utility Holding Company Act because the San Francisco utility operates primarily within California . That law regulates transactions between holding companies and their utility subsidiaries. Lockyer wants the SEC to withdraw PG&E's exemption, citing $13 billion in PG&E assets outside of California . ""All the primary evils addressed by PUHCA are relevant to PG&E Corp.,"" Lockyer's petition to the SEC stated. In Bankruptcy Court on Thursday, PG&E said it is close to reaching an agreement with Calpine Corp. to pay more than $267 million it owes the San Jose-based power generator and to preserve contracts for 453 megawatts of relatively cheap electricity . In all, PG&E buys about 2,600 megawatts of electricity from nearly 25 alternative generators, which are seeking repayment and release from their contracts through Bankruptcy Court. National Desk THE NATION Little Progress on Energy Rebate, Judge Hints RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR ? 07/06/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page A-30 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company WASHINGTON -- The federal mediator seeking a settlement for billions of dollars in alleged electricity overcharges in California signaled Thursday that the talks are in trouble, and analysts said hope for a deal seems to be fading. Curtis L. Wagner Jr., chief judge of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said he may issue a report on the closed-door talks as early as today if he sees no progress. ""The judge will perhaps issue a preliminary assessment of the talks,"" said Tamara Young-Allen, a spokeswoman for FERC. ""He will do this only if he feels the talks aren't moving along as he sees fit."" Originally, a preliminary report from the judge was not part of the plan. Wagner had previously said all sides would labor in private through the weekend to try to get a deal by Monday's midnight deadline. If that failed, the judge said he would take seven days to craft a proposed settlement for FERC's governing board. Kit Konolige, a power industry analyst with Morgan Stanley in New York, said Wagner's announcement on Thursday amounted to a judicial distress signal. ""The judge wouldn't say something like this if the parties were close to a settlement,"" said Konolige. ""I suppose he may be trying to jump-start things, but I think most people believed the sides were so far apart going into the talks that it seemed like a long way to go to reach a settlement."" Although Wagner has imposed a gag order on participants, several people with knowledge of the negotiations said Thursday that major power generators and California officials have not budged from dug-in positions since the talks began last week. They also said the judge is extremely frustrated with the state and with several large power suppliers. California is demanding $9 billion in refunds. According to sources, the generators have offered less than $1 billion. And some major power sellers are insisting they do not owe anything. Many experts say California has little hope of obtaining the $9 billion since only $5.4 billion of that is attributable to sellers under FERC's jurisdiction. On the other hand, it seems clear from statements by FERC commissioners that the board is prepared to extract significant refunds from generators. Wagner is said to be probing for a compromise figure between $1 billion and $9 billion. It could take the form of a mix of cash payments and discounts on long-term contracts for power. FERC's governing board ordered Wagner to hold the talks to see if a compromise could be struck on three big issues: refunds, guarantees that generators will be paid, and ways to shift more of the state's power purchases to long-term contracts. The board also made clear that it would impose its own settlement if the state and power sellers were unable to come to an agreement. Wagner said Thursday that if he issues a preliminary report today, he will give all the parties a chance to respond publicly on Monday. Such a report might embarrass some of the key players, since Wagner is known for his plain-spoken conclusions. The judge would then prepare a settlement recommendation for the FERC board by July 16. However, he also said he is willing to work through the weekend to reach a settlement if it appears within striking distance. The talks are in a large hearing room on the second floor of the FERC building near Washington's Union Station. Access is strictly controlled and special badges have been issued to the more than 140 lawyers participating. Some people with knowledge of the negotiations said Wagner's threat to issue a report may be a bid to see if one of the parties will make a move. ""It was like a shot across the bow,"" said one source. * RELATED STORIES Energy savers: College students help businesses cut waste. B1 SEC probe: The state urges a review of PG&E fund transfers.

Gray Davis, even though one of the consultants dropped his Southern California Edison contract amid conflict-of- interest allegations. Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane were collectively known as the ""Masters of Disaster"" for their work in the Clinton White House during various federal investigations. They also worked for Vice President Al Gore during the 2000 presidential campaign. Because of their work for Davis, Connell says the contract Fabiani and Lehane signed with Edison is a conflict of interest under state ethics rules. Davis is negotiating with Edison on a bailout for the utility. Late last week, at the bottom of a press release, Davis announced that Fabiani was no longer a communications consultant because his work had been ""successfully implemented."" Lehane, on the other hand, has dropped his contract with Edison and signed a new agreement with Davis. Lehane's new contract includes reimbursement for travel and meal expenses, which he didn't have before, and requires him to work a maximum of 66 hours a month at $150 an hour. His total payments are capped at $76,000 for work from June 26 to Nov. 20, 2001. In his release, Davis said Lehane would be paid the same amount as former communications director Phil Trounstine, about $9,900 a month. But Connell, like Davis a Democrat, said Trounstine undoubtedly worked more than 66 hours in a month for his $9,990. ""We don't intend to be paying it,"" Connell said of the contract for both men. ""They represented Southern California Edison. You have to have a singular relationship with the state of California and not show a conflict."" Previously, the Davis administration said there was no conflict because Edison and Davis wanted the same things out of their negotiations. Earlier this week, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said attorneys had different opinions over whether the two consultants had violated ethics rules. Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said the governor had signed an executive order allowing him to enter into consulting contracts with anyone he believed could help him solve the state's energy crisis. She said Lehane had been working full-time on public policy, even though his contract caps his salary. The National Tax-Limitation Committee, a Sacramento group that mostly monitors legislation, sued last month alleging that Fabiani and Lehane were violating the state Political Reform Act because of the Edison contract. In a recently filed disclosure statement, Fabiani also listed more than $10, 000 worth of consulting work for Cisco Systems, another company that frequently brings issues before state authorities, including Davis. The state Fair Political Practices Commission also is looking into a complaint filed by GOP Secretary of State Bill Jones that Fabiani and Lehane violated state ethics rules.

Page?A - 3 Ex-staff speaks out against Duke Two more charge prices manipulated Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Friday, July 6, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/07/06/M N122949.DTL Sacramento -- Two more former employees at Duke Energy's Chula Vista power plant came forward yesterday with allegations that the company manipulated the energy market to drive up prices, although they offered no hard proof and little new information. Their accusations bring to five the number of Duke plant workers who say they observed suspicious behavior, including the disappearance of parts needed for repairs, the idling of generators for no apparent reason, and continual stopping and starting that critics of Duke suspect was designed to withhold power and artificially increase prices. E. Robert Edwards, a 50-year-old electrician, related one conversation with a Duke foreman sometime in January that prompted suspicion. ""I asked the foreman why Unit 4 wasn't running,"" Edwards said yesterday at a press conference. ""We had a 225-megawatt generator sitting there, and he just shrugged his shoulders and said, 'I really can't tell you. I'm not privy to that information.' "" State lawmakers have been focusing on whether Duke manipulated prices during three days in January, when the company at one point offered a single megawatt of power for a record-shattering $3,880. Duke says it was following orders from the Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power grid, when it repeatedly turned its generators on and off during those three days. An ISO memo recently released by Duke confirms the company's contention it was under orders. But January logs from the ISO and the generators don't offer an explanation for every allegation of price manipulation, since Duke has refused to release a detailed list of the prices it offered and paid during that period. The two workers who came forward yesterday, Edwards and 46-year-old Richard J. Connors, both worked more than 20 years in the business. They left the South Bay Plant in Chula Vista in April, two years after Duke purchased it from San Diego Gas & Electric as part of deregulation. SOME SHIFTS UNPOPULAR ""It is true units were taken offline, mostly on the weekends for whatever reason,"" said Connors, a former auxiliary operator. ""It got to the point as an operator that you were dreading working swing shifts on Sunday or graveyard Monday morning because you knew you were going to be running around putting units back online."" Edwards said he had seen a company warehouse eventually emptied of parts that are used to repair broken generators, although he didn't know where the parts went. Forcing a longer wait for repair parts was designed to dry up the power supply and push prices higher, lawmakers and other investigators suspect. Edwards, however, admitted the warehouse was being cleaned out even when SDG&E ran the plant. Duke contends the workers weren't familiar with Duke's inventory system and couldn't possibly know why parts were being moved. Duke and other energy companies are facing scrutiny by two legislative committees, a 19-member Sacramento County grand jury, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer, the California Public Utilities Commission and federal regulators. BUSTAMANTE ALSO SUING Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, who introduced Edwards and Connors yesterday, also is suing a variety of generators in state court for alleged price manipulation and bad business practices. He said Edwards and Connors ""reiterated what we've know all along -- Duke has been gouging California consumers through its use and abuse of the South Bay Plant."" Duke offers a variety of defenses for its actions during the three days in January and throughout the energy crisis. Tom Williams, a spokesman for Duke, said Edwards and Connors had offered nothing new yesterday. Beyond the ISO's 37 separate orders to stop and start generators during the three days in January, Williams said state air regulations required the company to shut the plant at certain times because it was running out of emissions credits that limit the amount of air pollution it can put out. Duke, which controls about 5 percent of the state energy market, also contends the state's power transmission lines can't always handle an increase in load. ""Yes, it's true there are times when that plant is not running at full capacity, and there is a Stage Three (alert), and there may be blackouts in San Francisco,"" Williams said. ""The reason why it's not running is the power cannot move up Path 15,"" the transmission line bottleneck near Los Banos.

Johnson, Chronicle Staff Writer Friday, July 6, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/07/06/M N138966.DTL Vallejo leaders, looking to escape mounting gas and electric bills, are planning to build enough new power generators that the city government will be self-sufficient when it comes to energy. City officials said they believe that Vallejo is the first city in the nation to take such an approach. ""This is going to be a showplace,"" said Scott Sossen, the chief executive officer of Edge Capital Group, a funding agency based in Orange County. Edge will be supervising the work along with O'Hara Energy Corp. of Nevada. The plan comes at a time when the city expects to see its energy costs double next year if it continues buying its power from PG&E. ""It couldn't be more timely,"" said Mayor Tony Intintoli. Vallejo leaders are in the process of contracting with private business to build new wind, solar and microturbine generators. Construction of a one- megawatt solar generator could start within 30 to 60 days. Conservation is also part of the plan, and energy-efficiency improvements are already under way at Vallejo City Hall and the fire and police stations. City officials hope to add enough sources of power generation to make all city offices -- which consume about 10 megawatts a year -- self-sufficient by the end of the year. The Vallejo City Council gave tentative approval to the project late last month and will continue its discussions on the plan next week. Vallejo taxpayers won't have to pay any money in advance, because Edge will finance the project's first $50 million in capital costs. In return, a portion of the city's projected financial savings will be shared with the Edge and O'Hara. ""This is a fairly sizable project,"" said Kevin Chambers, the chief executive officer at O'Hara. ""Energy-efficient capital is difficult to find because it is such a new field."" O'Hara is installing high-tech energy management systems at all city-owned property to reduce energy consumption. Final sites for the construction of new wind, solar and microturbine generators have not been chosen. In recent years, the energy bill for Vallejo city government has averaged between $2 million and $3 million per year. That includes the police and fire departments, City Hall and water-pumping stations. Vallejo is part of a group of 50 local governments in Northern California that pooled their resources to buy electricity and natural gas, keeping prices down. But the group's current contract expires Dec. 30. As a result, the city expects its energy bill to double next year, from 9.2 cents per kilowatt hour to 20 cents per kilowatt hour. ""It's been very positive what we've been doing, and it hasn't cost us anything,"" said City Manager David Martinez. ""We're going to be very optimistic that this is going to be a good thing for the city."" City officials hope to eventually extend the plan to Vallejo's 4,500 businesses and 37,000 households.

Page?A - 23 SEC asked to see if PG&E Corp. violated law with subsidiary Published Friday, July 6, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News BY JENNIFER BJORHUS Mercury News California Attorney General Bill Lockyer asked the federal Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday to step in to investigate whether PG&E Corp. violated federal law in taking billions of dollars from its bankrupt subsidiary. ``SEC scrutiny is essential to protect the public interest, ratepayers and the people of the state of California,'' Lockyer said in a statement. More than $4 billion flowed from the Pacific Gas & Electric utility to parent PG&E Corp. from 1997 to 1999, according to Lockyer's petition, representing nearly 70 percent of the cash that flowed to the parent company during that period. PG&E Corp. spent $2.7 billion to buy back its stock, $1.5 billion to pay dividends to shareholders and invested $800 million in its other subsidiaries, according to the petition filed Thursday in Washington. Those figures are similar to figures from a state-ordered independent audit of PG&E Corp.'s finances released in late January. By moving assets from the utility to other businesses, the company potentially harmed the utility and violated the federal Public Utility Holding Company Act in several ways, according to the petition. The SEC is the nation's top cop for publicly held companies. But the commission has not reviewed PG&E Corp.'s asset movements, saying the company is exempt from scrutiny under the Public Utility Holding Company Act because it's mainly a California operation and such intrastate operations are exempt. The attorney general's office argues that PG&E Corp., with more than $13 billion of its assets outside the state, can no longer claim it is primarily an intrastate company. The SEC should step in, it argues. The petition surprised PG&E Corp. officials, who said they had no idea the attorney general's office had an issue with the company's exemption from the federal law, said company spokesman Greg Pruett. Pruett said PG&E Corp.'s actions were appropriate because the federal utility law only applies if a company has one or more of the following activities in several states: electric transmission and distribution, gas distribution or utility-owned generation. ``We have none of those things except in California,'' Pruett said, adding that the National Energy Group, a PG&E Corp. affiliate, ``has natural gas transmission but no distribution.'' ``The power plants that NEG owns or operates are not part of a utility and thus aren't regulated by PUCHA, and it has an energy-trading arm that is also not regulated by PUCHA,'' he said. The petition further asks the SEC to order PG&E Corp. to cooperate fully with the California Public Utilities Commission. The state commission is investigating whether PG&E Corp.'s corporate structure and its relationship with its bankrupt utility violate state utility regulations. The petition states it expects a response from the SEC within 60 days. But SEC spokesman John Heine said there's no statutory deadline for a response. He said he had not seen the petition and could not comment. Contact Jennifer Bjorhus at jbjorhus@sjmercury.com or (408) 920-5660. Judge may speed up electricity refund talks Published Friday, July 6, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News BY RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR Los Angeles Times WASHINGTON -- A federal mediator seeking a settlement for billions of dollars in alleged electricity overcharges in California signaled Thursday that the talks are in trouble.

Davis keeps state addicted to fossil fuels Published Friday, July 6, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News BY JOE COSTELLO BEFORE this year's energy ``crisis,'' Gray Davis wanted to be known as the education governor. However, Davis and his advisers' energy teachings have revealed alarming failures, setting back state energy policy not one or two years, but one or two decades. While George W. Bush proposed an energy policy tied to fossil fuels, disproportionate building of centralized generation plants, too little energy efficiency, lowering environmental standards and increased global warming emissions, Davis enacted it. First, Davis has tied the state for the next decade or longer to contracts with facilities that are exclusively fossil fuel generation. Second, he has encouraged an unprecedented surge in the building of new centralized fossil fuel plants. Finally, he has pushed the lowering of environmental standards to increase production from the dirtiest fossil fuel facilities. The state's new energy purchasing department has spent zero on renewable generation. David Freeman, the governor's energy czar, giving lip service to alternatives, has negotiated close to $50 billion in long-term contracts with fossil fuel generators. By comparison, the governor has authorized investment of only $13 million in expanding solar generation. Photovoltaic cells produce electricity directly from the sun's energy, offering a clean, efficient solution to the state's future peak energy demand. While the governor talks a lot about energy efficiency, the state's funding of demand programs is about 1 percent of the funding for supply. Most egregious, the vast majority of state energy efficiency money is funneled back to the utilities. While environmentalists deride the Bush administration proposals, in California organizations such as the Natural Resources Defense Council actively support Davis' fossil fuel energy policy. The Davis energy policy has stuck California with the same old electric system for at least the next decade. Money has literally been burned instead of invested in innovation and creation of a cleaner and more efficient system. The best hedge against price spikes is a diversity of fuel sources, unfortunately California's electric system is now tied to an even greater degree to fossil fuels. After binding the state economy to the past, the Davis end game is logical. Davis and his energy advisers want to spend tens of billions of dollars for the utilities' restoration -- the very companies that for so long stifled industry innovation and remain most responsible for California's energy fiasco. There is still an opportunity to make the best out of a bad situation. Instead of bailing out the utilities, they should be dismantled and sold off. A combination of a dozen or so local government and publicly owned companies should be created with a goal of innovating the industry. An auction could be held that would sell customer blocks and with it the state's long-term contracts. Choice should be reinstated with the lifting of the suspension on direct access to alternative suppliers. Instead of moving the state to the next level of energy development, the education governor's remedial energy teachings will force California to repeat its energy lessons.

Business Economics fuels power solution in California Price relief gains political support Robert Gibbons, BridgeNews ? 07/06/2001 Chicago Tribune North Sports Final ; N Page 3 (Copyright 2001 by the Chicago Tribune) Political pressure coming from the U.S. Congress and politicians from Western states seems to have influenced the approach to the power crisis, despite opposition to price caps in the Bush administration. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in June expanded price mitigation measures on wholesale electricity sales in California during periods when blackouts are possible. The measures encourage generators to sell power into the state to prevent emergency alerts from being declared, which trigger price caps. The move came with support growing in Congress, especially among representatives of Western states on both sides of the aisle, for legislation that would have capped wholesale prices in the region. The macroeconomic force may have been the difference between the $7 billion cost of power for California in 1999 and its rise to approximately $27 billion in 2000. The cost is estimated to reach between $50 billion and $70 billion in 2001. With that kind of money at stake, suddenly the concern becomes less a question of who is responsible for the problem, but rather, how it can be solved quickly to prevent harsh political consequences. California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer has conducted an investigation into the actions of power generators and offered multimillion dollar rewards to whistleblowers to provide evidence of price manipulation by independent power generators. The state is seeking refunds of $8.9 billion, the amount it estimates independent power generators overcharged California 's troubled utilities. The U.S. General Accounting Office has released a report criticizing the FERC for not finding evidence of power generators using plant outages to drive up prices in California . ""FERC's [February] study was not thorough enough to support its overall conclusion that audited companies were not physically withholding electricity supply to influence prices,"" the GAO found. Of the major independent power generators and marketers, like Reliant Energy, Dynegy, Duke Energy and Enron, only Williams and its CEO Keith Bailey came out in April in favor of some sort of short- term price relief for California . ""The political dynamic out there is much more Draconian than what we're proposing,"" Bailey told analysts in April, defending Williams' position supporting some limited, short-term price mitigation. What he was worried about was California Gov. Gray Davis using eminent domain powers to take over power plants and the state setting up a public power authority to build state-owned plants. Financial California Changes Stance on Refunds; Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks Peter Behr ? 07/06/2001 The Washington Post FINAL Page E01 Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity , saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis. ""We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get us $8.9 billion,"" Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. ""You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion."" The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close to the negotiations. Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise. ""What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood,"" Wagner told reporters. ""In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment."" The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday. Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility, drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn, chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said. Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides, is closed to the public and media. Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a ""joke"" that the parties might as well wear ""clown suits,"" according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks. But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said. Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure, some energy analysts believe. Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals. California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile ""spot market"" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so did the state's electricity bills. In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy analysts say. A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a ""refund"" because the deals were reached ""under commercial duress,"" according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. ""There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be,"" said Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a ""just and reasonable"" standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. ""It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate,"" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid. Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room ""billions of dollars apart,"" as the talks approached their final weekend, sources said. http://www.washingtonpost.com Contact: http://www.washingtonpost.com Politics & Policy U.S. Hearing Officer May Impose Pact To End California Power-Overcharge Case By Richard B. Schmitt ? 07/06/2001 The Wall Street Journal Page A10 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) WASHINGTON -- With settlement talks apparently stalled, a federal hearing officer said he may propose his own solution to settle billions in alleged electricity overcharges tied to the California power crisis. Curtis L. Wagner Jr. said he was still ""optimistic"" California officials and several power companies could come to terms on $8.9 billion in disputed electricity charges the state has incurred over the past year. Absent more-meaningful progress, he said he would offer his own ""preliminary assessment"" and recommendation as soon as today. In that event, Mr. Wagner also said, he would convene a hearing Monday where the two sides would be given the chance to comment on his plans. Mr. Wagner has previously indicated he feels California is due some refunds, but far less than the total the state claims. California is also indebted to the power companies for billions in previous deliveries; those debts could at least partially offset any refunds. Mr. Wagner has also said long-term contracts that would insulate the state from the sort of price shocks it has experienced over the past year could be part of any resolution. An administrative-law judge with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Mr. Wagner was named by the panel two weeks ago to broker a peace of the overcharge dispute. Commission officials have given the parties until Monday to reach an agreement behind closed doors. After that, absent a settlement, the commission has ordered Mr. Wagner to report back with his findings and recommendations within a week. At that point, the commission has said it will impose a settlement of its own liking. The overcharge issue has been a flash point in the California debacle, with the state's governor, Gray Davis, calling the energy companies ""pirates"" and ""marauders."" The industry considers itself a scapegoat for a bungled state deregulation effort.",0

Gray Davis, faced with the near inevitability of raising consumers' electricity bills, is leaning toward a rate system whereby those who use more power pay more than those who conserve, The Chronicle has learned. Sources close to the governor said he is being lobbied by his own staff members to accept a so-called structured rate system. Top officials from his own administration told lawmakers Friday that the state may end up spending more than twice the $10 billion previously estimated to purchase power on behalf of California's near-bankrupt utilities. If so, the officials warned that consumers' electricity rates could double. In the case of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., this would mean customers' average monthly power bills would rise from $60 to $120. Consumers throughout the Bay Area believe that at least some increase is on the way. ""We're going to have to bite the bullet and pay the money,"" said Larry Webster, a retired Caltrans worker in Redwood City. ""We might as well admit that electricity is no longer a nickel. It's a dime. If you're going to use it, let's pay for it."" Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, distanced himself yesterday from estimates that rates would double. The figures reported in the press, he said, ""were wildly high."" ""The governor still believes he can live within the existing rate structure, "" Maviglio said. ""Until we know the results of the negotiations with the utilities, you can't conclude anything."" The state is negotiating a multibillion-dollar bailout package with PG&E and Southern California Edison Co. to relieve the utilities of about $13 billion in debt. PG&E and Edison have been saying for months that there is no way California can overcome its current energy woes without higher rates. The irony of the Davis administration now saying the same thing was not lost on the two companies. ""The state is in the exact same position the utilities were in last fall,"" said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman. ""Either wholesale prices need to come down or retail prices need to go up. The disparity is too large."" Statewide blackouts last week drove home the precariousness of California's energy situation to ratepayers -- and may have served as a blessing in disguise for the governor. COST VS. OUTAGES If given a choice between further outages and paying higher rates, many consumers said they would accept increases in their power bills. ""I don't like either choice,"" said Janet Leroux, facing the possibility of a gooey mess if the air conditioning goes out at her downtown San Francisco candy store. ""But I guess I'd go with higher rates. I sure didn't like the blackouts."" Publicly, the governor has been insisting for weeks that rates will stay within ""the existing rate structure"" -- a stealthy way of saying that January's 9 percent increase and an expected 10 percent increase next year will remain in place. But privately, he and his staff are discussing additional rate increases that could be spread over as long as 10 years, sources said. Utility executives and power generators told The Chronicle last week that a minimum 30 percent rate increase lasting up to a decade is in the cards. ""For the good of California, it's inevitable,"" said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a Menlo Park energy industry association. Sacramento resident John Hax observed that when temperatures soar in the Central Valley this summer, he'd be more than willing to pay a higher price for power if this keeps the air conditioners on. ""It's like gasoline,"" he said. ""I don't like paying higher prices for gasoline, but that's the price of doing business."" Ratepayers draw the line, though, at any increase topping 10 or 20 percent. ""If it was 20 percent, I'd probably do it,"" said Tracy resident Mark Dougherty. ""But if it was more, like 50 percent, I'd rather go with rolling blackouts."" ""I'd rather have blackouts,"" agreed Jenny Soghomonian, owner of a shoe- repair shop in San Francisco's Financial District. ""I don't want to pay rates that are so much higher."" NOT EVERY COST PALATABLE This is the tightrope that state officials and industry players now find themselves walking: While consumers may be willing to pay more to avoid blackouts, they aren't willing to swallow virtually any cost thrown their way. Yet if rates are not high enough, they may not prevent daily blackout threats this summer and beyond. ""Higher rates are the price signal that it takes for conservation,"" said Tom Higgins, senior vice president of Edison International, parent company of Southern California Edison. Simply put, he meant that most consumers will not aggressively conserve power, and thus alleviate shortages, unless there is a financial incentive to do so. Rebates proposed by the governor have met with only a lukewarm response, requiring, critics say, too much effort on the part of individual ratepayers. But a sudden spike in monthly power bills almost certainly would prompt widespread conservation measures. ""It adjusts consumer behavior,"" Higgins said. ""People want to get their bills back down."" RATES' EFFECT ON USAGE He and other industry sources said higher rates are perhaps the only way Californians will achieve the 10 percent conservation goal sought by the governor -- a move seen as vital if blackouts are to be avoided this summer. ""It's intellectually dishonest to think there's any other way out of this,"" Higgins said. Consumer activists' initial reaction to any talk of a rate increase comes across loud and clear: No, no, no. ""No bailout. No rate increases. No secret deals,"" said Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. ""We need to get back to a regulated system."" Rosenfield is the biggest fly in the governor's ointment. He has threatened to push through a ballot initiative re-regulating California's power market if Davis cannot find a consumer-friendly way out of the current fix. Because of Rosenfield's past success in writing a ballot measure on insurance rebates, which delivered about $800 million to consumers, his threat is taken seriously in Sacramento. ""We've paid too much already,"" Rosenfield said. ""A fair price is what we were promised by deregulation, which was a 20 percent rate decrease."" However, when he was asked whether there was any room to discuss a structured rate increase such as the idea being promoted by the governor's staff, Rosenfield toned down his characteristic rhetoric. ""Big users should pay more,"" he said after a moment's reflection. ""I'm open to a tiered system but only if it's fair."" Rosenfield quickly added that he would have to see how other consumer advocates felt about the matter before agreeing to negotiate such things with Davis. MOVE TOWARD STRUCTURED RATES Clearly, though, momentum is building toward a system of structured power rates, which probably would include increases of varying sizes for consumers. The California Public Utilities Commission is scheduled to address January's 9 percent rate increase on Tuesday. That increase originally was given only a three-month duration, but most observers expect it to be renewed for at least another three months, if not longer. PUC President Loretta Lynch declined to comment on the likelihood of rates going up but added her voice to those backing a structured system. ""I am a fan of restructuring rates to exempt conservation,"" she said. ""People who use a whole lot of power should pay more."" The biggest electricity customer in the state is the state itself, now that California is purchasing power on behalf of its cash-poor utilities. The state already has spent about $4 billion buying electricity and has yet to determine how the cash will be recouped from consumers. San Francisco resident Rosita Magee accepts that for California to find its energy footing once more, rates will probably be heading up. ""That way, you have more convenience and electricity, more stability,"" she said. But Magee has come up with another solution, one that doesn't involve rate increases and rolling blackouts. She's moving to Texas. Chronicle staff writers Matthew Stannard and Pia Sarkar contributed to this report. / E-mail David Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle ?

"FTC Staff Report on Electricity Restructuring. Yesterday, the Federal Trade Commission issued a staff report on electricity restructuring issues. It is an update of the July 2000 report done at the request of House Energy Chairman Tauzin and Subcommittee Chairman Barton. They requested the report be updated. A summary of the report and the full 80+ page text is on the FTC web site at www.ftc.gov on the upper left side of the home page. I read the summary and will read the balance. So far, so good. It basically says that even states that have opened up to retail competition are in transition with a hybrid of regulation and competition, thus the expected benefits of competition have not yet emerged. However, the report states that nothing to date indicates that competition, once the transition period is over, will not produce additional benefits for consumers. The report's major conclusion is that competitive wholesale markets are important to achieving effective competition in retail markets. The summary includes something that sounds promising on RTO policy, saying ""And as wholesale and retail markets become regional, governing policies and jurisdictional approaches also must move in that direction for wholesale and retail competition to be successful.""",5

"Report on Senate Energy Hearing Today. Earlier today, the Senate Energy Committee held the first of two days of hearings on Chairman Bingaman's ""white paper"" on electricity and the electricity provisions of other pending bills. The hearings will continue tomorrow with all of the five FERC commissioners as witnesses plus private sector witnesses. Today's hearing went well from our perpective, with support for Super RTOs and general support for expanding the grid both physically and from an access view point voiced by Senators and witnesses. Sen. Craig Thomas even said four RTOs were too many -- there should be one national RTO to run a national grid. Today's witnesses represented the Dept. of Energy, EPSA, EEI, NRECA, APPA, IBEW union, Alliance to Save Energy, ELCON, NERC, NARUC, NASUCA and the State of New Mexico. We will provide a more detailed analysis after completing a review of the lengthy written testimony, but a summary of the DOE testimony and the first panel of private sector witnesses follows. 1. DOE said they are working on electricity legislative language. Should be done soon. Chairman Bingaman said they needed to get it done in time for the Committee to consider it when the Committee takes up electricity as early as the second week in September. Deputy Sec. Blake implied that their proposal was or would soon be shared with other Administration agencies for review. 2. In response to questions, Blake said that legislative action on jurisdiction questions (fed v. state) would be ""useful"" but he stressed that they view any new legislation as clarifying that FERC has authority they feel already exists. He said that while states have an important role to play, Congress must recongize the interstate character of the market and the need for open access to the interstate grid. (In response to a question, Blake later said that FERC had largely addressed the access issue or would do so.) 3. On reliability, he was given a chance to say that DOE supports th NERC ""consensus"" language, but instead repeated that the Administration favors ""enforceable reliability standards"" but wants to work with the Committee on the exact language. I took this as confirmation of what we have heard informally from DOE in terms of key players there not being enamored of the NERC ""consensus"" approach, at least as it exists in its old, long form. 4. Sens. Craig and Cantwell pushed Blake on why the Administration has not fully supported BPA's request for a debt limit increase to finance expansion of the BPA grid. Blake said they support the BPA expansion projects, but that OMB feels BPA has enough borrowing authority through 2003. This did not sit well with Craig and Cantwell. I spoke with Sen. Craig in the hall, following up on a conversation I had with him the other evening about BPA, and he stressed that he is committed to getting BPA the debt limit it needs. As you know, commercial has asked us to help BPA given matters pending between Enron and BPA. 5. On the first private sector panel, even John Rowe, the Co-CEO of Exelon and past EEI chairman (testifying for his company and EEI), said several times that there should be strong RTOs that each cover a wide idea. He said his board voted yesterday to sell its transmission assets IF a strong, independent operator could be found. Rowe also said that RTOs should be ""encouraged"" (implying not mandatory?). The APPA witness was strong on RTOs, saying that all entities will be part of RTOs even without legislation. NRECA said that co-ops would oppose federal jurisdiction over them and that they favor voluntary RTOs. EPSA made the usual case for competition, open access, RTOs, etc.",0

"AG letter - privileged and confidential: request for legal advice.. The letter looks good. A couple of comments for your consideration: On page three we describe the change to the definition of Public Utility and then argue that we don't fit into it. Would it be worth explaining why that makes sense? Specifically, the New Jersey restructuring law, like most efforts of its kind in other markets, is designed to separate the competitive from monopoly elements of the power (and gas) businesses. Economic regulation would then be restricted to the remaining monopoly elements of the business (eg distribution). The competitive market can not be solely relied upon to ""regulate"" the behavior of monopoly asset owners, such as distribution utilities. Therefore, regulators continue to be called upon to set pricing and other terms of service. What those regulators decide matters a great deal to those monopoly utilities and it consequently makes sense for lawmakers to be concerned about attempts by such entities to use campaign contributions to tacitly influence decision makers. The same public policies simply do not apply to that portion of the market which is competitive. The generation and sales business has a competitive structure (i.e. relatively low barriers to entry, multiple competitors etc.). These components of the power and gas business can be ""regulated"" by the market with respect to rates and terms of service. They do not require economic regulation any more than grocery stores, department stores, appliance sellers or other ""retailers"" (who presumably are not prohibited from making contributions. Competition and markets discipline behavior and establish competitive prices and terms of service. Because regulators don't set the prices and terms of service for such sellers, there is no reason to be concerned about campaign contribuitions from such organizations. Indeed, the legislation, and the legislative history, clearly conform to this underlying policy rationale. As a former practicing lawyer, I certainly understand the value of pleading in the alternative. But, I question how certain of our arguments woud be perceived by the public if they ever came to light (which these documents have a habit of doing).. . I can just see the press seizing on Enron's claim of ""ignorance or mistake"" or the fact that we pled for the favorable exercise of ""prosecutorial discretion"". I suggest that we add whatever we feel is necessary to the very solid looking intent argument, not make specific reference to ""ignorance or mistake"", and not plead for the favorable esxercise of PD. If we feel we need to write about this last item, perhaps we could suggest that it would be a waste of the public's resources to pursue a claim under such circumstances.",0

Davis seems to continue to put distance between himself and the contracts. Best, Jeff ********************************************************************** Financial California Changes Stance on Refunds; Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks Peter Behr 07/06/2001 The Washington Post FINAL Page E01 Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity , saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis. ""We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get us $8.9 billion,"" Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. ""You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion."" The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close to the negotiations. Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise. ""What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood,"" Wagner told reporters. ""In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment."" The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday. Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility, drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn, chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said. Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides, is closed to the public and media. Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a ""joke"" that the parties might as well wear ""clown suits,"" according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks. But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said. Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure, some energy analysts believe. Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals. California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile ""spot market"" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so did the state's electricity bills. In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy analysts say. A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a ""refund"" because the deals were reached ""under commercial duress,"" according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. ""There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be,"" said Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a ""just and reasonable"" standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. ""It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate,"" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid. Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room ""billions of dollars apart,"" as the talks approached their final weekend, sources said.",0

"BY MARK GOLDEN A DOW JONES NEWSWIRES COLUMN NEW YORK (DOW JONES)--THE CALIFORNIA SENATE IN SACRAMENTO PASSED A WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX ON SALES OF ELECTRICITY INTO THE STATE'S WHOLESALE ELECTRICITY MARKET MONDAY AFTERNOON AT 4:50 P.M. PDT. AT ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME TIME, CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR INITIATED ROLLING BLACKOUTS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE MARCH. COINCIDENCE? PROBABLY, BUT THE CONNECTION SHOULDN'T BE IGNORED. ""THE POLICY DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED IN CALIFORNIA TO DATE HAVE ACCELERATED AN ALREADY SERIOUS MARKET COLLAPSE,"" SAID A HARVARD UNIVERSITY STUDY OF CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY CRISIS LATE LAST MONTH. THIS WEEK'S WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX BILL IS THE LATEST BLUNT INSTRUMENT WIELDED WITH POTENTIALLY DISASTROUS RESULTS. GOV. GRAY DAVIS WANTED IT AS A STICK WHEN (CONT) MEETING WITH EXECUTIVES FROM THE STATE'S MERCHANT POWER COMPANIES WEDNESDAY. THE MANEUVER WAS LESS THAN ADROIT, AND THE GENERATORS WEREN'T IMPRESSED. AFTER THE MEETING WITH DAVIS, RELIANT ENERGY'S (REI) JOHN STOUT SAID THAT IF THE TAX WERE IMPLEMENTED IN CALIFORNIA, IT WOULD ""INSTANTLY BLACK OUT ALL THE GENERATION IN THE STATE."" THE STATE'S LEADERS MIGHT KEEP IN MIND WHO WIELDS THE BIGGER STICK AT THIS POINT. CALIFORNIA SET UP A MARKET IN WHICH SELLERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CHARGE VERY HIGH PRICES FOR ELECTRICITY SINCE SUPPLIES STARTED GETTING TIGHT A YEAR AGO. SELLERS SAY THEY HAVE PLAYED BY THE RULES THEY WERE GIVEN, AND NOBODY HAS PROVED OTHERWISE WITH THE ONE EXCEPTION OF A FINE PAID BY WILLIAMS COMPANIES (WMB) FOR ONE PARTICULAR INSTANCE OF VIOLATING A CONTRACT. ""IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY INVENTED A NEW GAME, INVITED YOU OVER TO PLAY AND THEN CHANGED THE RULES A COUPLE OF TIMES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME. THEN, AFTER YOU BEAT THEM, THEY INSIST YOU CHEATED,"" SAID ONE WESTERN ENERGY TRADER. ALMOST EVERY ATTEMPT BY THE BUY SIDE - THE UTILITIES, THE ISO AND NOW THE (CONT) STATE TREASURY - TO LOWER PRICES HAS RESULTED IN HIGHER PRICES OR BLACKOUTS OR BOTH. THE WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX IDEA IS THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE, BUT THOSE WHO INSIST ON PRICE CAPS SHOULD KEEP THIS IN MIND: THE ISO HAS HAD PRICE CAPS SINCE IT BEGAN OPERATION MORE THAN THREE YEARS AGO. OBVIOUSLY, PRICE CAPS HAVEN'T WORKED, JUST AS THEY HAVE NEVER WORKED EXCEPT DURING WARTIME. IN FACT, PRICE CAPS HAVE BEEN A QUESTIONABLE MEDICINE PRESCRIBED FOR THE WRONG DISEASE. AT BEST, PRICE CAPS MIGHT RESTRICT PRICE SPIKES. CALIFORNIA'S PROBLEM IS PERPETUAL HIGH PRICES. IT CAN'T AFFORD THE GOING RATE AT NIGHTTIME, LET ALONE THE HIGHER MARKET PRICES DURING THE AFTERNOONS IN A HEATWAVE. CALIFORNIA MUST FIGURE OUT HOW TO PLAY BETTER THE GAME IT INVENTED. THE INSANELY COMPLICATED COMPUTER-BASED PURCHASING OF POWER ENDED A FEW MONTHS AGO, AFTER THE CALIFORNIA POWER EXCHANGE WAS CLOSED DOWN BY FEDERAL REGULATORS AND THE ISO LOST ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO BUY POWER. THE MATCH BETWEEN THE PROGRAMS AND THE ENERGY TRADERS WASN'T EXACTLY IBM'S ""BIG BLUE"" VERSUS GARRY KASPAROV. ALMOST EVERYONE IN THE MARKET AGREES THAT THE UTILITIES' HUMAN TRADERS COULD (CONT) HAVE BOUGHT NEEDED POWER FOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS LESS THAN THE PROGRAMS THAT THE UTILITIES WERE REQUIRED TO USE BY STATE LAW. SINCE THE DEMISE OF PROGRAMMED PURCHASING, THE COMPUTERS HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY HUMANS, BUT WITHOUT MUCH BETTER RESULTS. THE TEAM ASSEMBLED TO BUY TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF SPOT POWER EVERY DAY CONSISTS MOSTLY OF FORMER EMPLOYEES OF THE POWER EXCHANGE AND ISO, AS WELL AS EXPENSIVE CONSULTANTS WITH NO ENERGY TRADING EXPERIENCE. ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE TRADING TEAM, FOR EXAMPLE, IS A FORMER PUBLIC RELATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE POWER EXCHANGE WITH NO TRADING EXPERIENCE PRIOR TO THE CURRENT JOB. AS ONE ISO EMPLOYEE WAS WONT TO SAY: ""IT'S LIKE WATCHING A FOOTBALL GAME BETWEEN NOTRE DAME AND ST. MARY'S SCHOOL FOR UNWED MOTHERS."" AND THE SIGNING OF TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF FIVE- AND 10-YEAR CONTRACTS IS BEING EXECUTED MAINLY BY FORMER EXECUTIVES OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON - PEOPLE THAT LEFT THE UTILITY YEARS AGO TO BECOME CONSULTANTS AND ALSO DON'T HAVE TRADING EXPERIENCE. GOOD IDEAS, MEANWHILE, HAVE LANGUISHED. (CONT) ""WE ARE GOING TO INSTALL METERS IN EVERY MAJOR COMMERCIAL CONCERN IN THE STATE THIS SUMMER AND GO TO REAL-TIME PRICING,"" DAVIS TOLD WALL STREET ANALYSTS ON FEB. 28. THAT PROPOSAL WAS GREETED BY MANY OBSERVERS AS THE MOST CONSTRUCTIVE IDEA FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO DATE. WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO REAL-TIME PRICING FOR CALIFORNIA'S BIG BUSINESSES SINCE THEN? NOTHING. ""THE PROBLEM IS THAT EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA IS 'SPECIAL',"" SAID STANFORD ECONOMIST AND CALIFORNIA ISO CONSULTANT FRANK WOLAK. EVERY INDUSTRY FROM OIL REFINERS TO INTERNET SERVER FARMS HAS HAD LOBBYISTS IN SACRAMENTO SUCCESSFULLY SECURING EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE. ""MY POINT HAS BEEN THAT IF WHAT THEY DO IS SO VALUABLE, THEN THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE HIGHER PRICES. BUSINESSES WITH ABOUT 10,000 MEGAWATTS OF LOAD HAVE REAL-TIME METERS. EVERY ONE OF THEM SHOULD BE GETTING MARKET PRICES,"" SAID WOLAK. (CONT) ONE OF THE GREATEST ADVANTAGES THAT SELLERS OF ELECTRICITY TO CALIFORNIA HAVE HAD IS THAT CONSUMERS HAVE FIXED PRICES, SO DEMAND IS INFLEXIBLE. SELLERS KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH ELECTRICITY THE UTILITIES MUST BUY BASED ON TEMPERATURES AND THE TIME OF DAY, WOLAK SAYS, AND THEY SIMPLY SUPPLY THE MARKET JUST ENOUGH POWER AT HIGH MARGINAL PRICES. REDUCING OVERALL CONSUMPTION THROUGH HIGHER RATES WILL HELP THE STATE SOME, BUT MAKING 25% OF DEMAND FLEXIBLE BASED ON PRICE WOULD GIVE THE STATE A FIGHTING CHANCE IN THE MARKET, ACCORDING TO WOLAK. BUT THAT, APPARENTLY, IS TOO COMPLICATED OR POLITICALLY DIFFICULT. PRICE CAPS, A WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX AND POLITICAL PATRONAGE JOBS FOR BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF POWER MAY NOT SAVE THE STATE FROM BANKRUPTCY, BUT THEY ARE EASIER TO SELL - OR SLIP THROUGH - IN SACRAMENTO. -BY MARK GOLDEN, DOW JONES NEWSWIRES; 201-938-4604; MARK.GOLDEN@DOWJONES.COM",0

Mr. Skilling's office is hesitant to allocate more than two hours without your recommendation. Emerson is being persistent. The key players from Emerson are David Farr, newly appointed CEO, and James Berges, President and effectively the leader of Emerson's strategic development effort. It is anticipated that both would attend the meeting. Emerson execs want to (i) get to know Mr. Skilling and other senior management, (ii) discuss mutual business opportunities, and (iii) hold a discussion about the transformation of Enron from a pipeline company to its current form. The last point has to do with Emerson's continuing self-transformation effort and how Enron achieved its transformation. I need your advice and recommendation. Please respond by e-mail or telephone (x5-4040). Background: Emerson initiated this latest round of contact with Enron in November 2000, when Mike Train and Mark Proudfoot, both Emerson VPs of Corporate Development, visited the Enron building hosted by Steve Kean. I met them at that time. Since that initial meeting, Emerson has aggressively pursued a business joint venture as preferred supplier with Martin Wenzel and the distributed power business, I believe with promising results. My sense is that Emerson is uniquely positioned as EES' partner in that business. I am waiting to receive an update from Martin. Emerson is also interested in becoming a preferred supplier for EES's DSM business. While we generally support that idea, we are pressing Emerson to reciprocate by becoming a customer of our bundled outsource business. Emerson is highly decentralized, and our efforts to date have been unsuccessful. I want to use the meeting as an opportunity to press Emerson to consider a proposal from EES's bundled outsource business. Please let me know your recommendation on this matter",3

By MICHAEL LIEDTKE AP Business Writer 05/03/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - There's a limit to how much people will pay for most things in life. If the cost scares off enough buyers, prices eventually fall. So what would happen if this textbook example from Economics 101 were applied to California's electricity crisis? What if the state officials struggling to maintain energy supplies simply refused to buy power above a certain price and accepted more blackouts this summer? The question would have been absurd just a few months ago and even now the notion seems surreal, given the possible consequences. Inviting even more blackouts inevitably would hurt businesses and frustrate consumers, threatening to further depress California's already slumping economy - the sixth largest in the world. But desperate times require drastic measures, according to the economists, lawmakers and activists who believe the state will be better off sitting in the dark than buying electricity at any price during a summer shortage likely to produce recurring blackouts anyway. ""It's better to use (blackouts) and break the (wholesale energy) cartel than simply to suffer them,"" said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumer Action Network, a San Diego watchdog group. Refusing to buy enough power to keep the lights on ""would be like playing with fire,"" counters Wells Fargo & Co. chief economist Sung Won Sohn. ""Blackouts aren't a just matter of inconvenience or being too hot or cold. They cost businesses a lot of money."" Buying electricity at the last minute to meet the state's power needs already has cost the California government $5.7 billion in the past 3 1/2 months. The state energy bill for 2001 could reach $50 billion, in money otherwise spent on education, public safety and health care, Shames said. Faced with the prospect of a significant budget deficit, some lawmakers think it's time for California to take a stand against the power wholesalers - many of whom are based outside the state. This Tuesday, the state Senate Energy Committee will consider authorizing the state to refuse to buy power above certain prices. Current law requires state electricity managers to avoid blackouts by buying all available power at any cost. ""We have been over a barrel in so many ways,"" said Sen. Dede Alpert, D-Coronado, who sponsored SB73x. ""Maybe there's a point in the market where (we) just say no and go with the planned blackout strategy instead."" Economists give the bill little chance of succeeding. ""It's never going to happen. It's not a viable option,"" said University of California at Berkeley Professor Severin Borenstein, one of the energy experts who have studied the idea. The business lost during blackouts would mean more layoffs in a state already skittish over the technology downturn and the looming Hollywood writers strike, economists say. Other ripple effects include diminished gasoline supplies, leading to even higher prices at the pump, and distribution headaches that could leave store shelves bare. And some consumers - the elderly and the infirm, for example, need power at any price. Without electricity, Manteca resident Betty Jarzemkoski said she wouldn't be able to help her ailing husband to get out of his motorized bed at home. ""It would be a real hardship for us,"" said Jarzemkoski, 78. ""I'm on a fixed income so I hope they can figure out something to bring down prices. But we need power."" Despite such concerns, the concept of a buyer's boycott hasn't been flatly ruled out - at least publicly - by Gov. Gray Davis as he struggles to reduce the state's staggering electricity bill. The state is spending as much as $90 million per day to meet California's electricity needs and the bleeding is sure to get worse. When the summer heat increases demand and tightens supplies, California might spend more than $1 billion each week, state officials estimate. Extended blackouts pose an even greater cost, economists say. When Northern California suffered rolling blackouts for several hours Jan. 18-19, the economic losses totaled $2.3 billion, mostly from lost profits and wages, estimated the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp. Multiply that over several weeks across the entire state, and it becomes apparent why it makes more sense for California to continue buying power at inflated prices, even if leaves the state with deep debts and a ruined credit rating, economists argue. As it is, California probably won't be able to round up enough power at any price on some days this summer, making some blackouts a virtual certainty. The blackouts will reduce the state's economic output by $2 billion to $16 billion, according to a study released last month by the Bay Area Economic Forum. The resolve of the state's politicians and ratepayers would be sorely tested for a boycott to succeed, much in the way that labor strikes boil down to whether workers or management can withstand more financial pain. ""Politicians aren't going to willingly turn out the lights because politicians want to get re-elected,"" said Borenstein, director of the University of California's energy institute. ""As soon as people start losing their jobs because the power is off, the public will get tired of the blackouts real quick."" Still, Californians might tolerate an increase in blackouts if they understand why the state chose to pursue such a drastic course, said Stanford economics Professor Frank Wolak, who heads the Independent System Operator's market surveillance committee. ""This isn't something you could do without an enormous public relations campaign,"" he said. ""The campaign would have to explain that the state had no other choice but to do this because (federal power regulators) aren't doing their job and enforcing the law against unjust and unreasonable prices."" The largest out-of-state generators are in such robust financial shape that it might take weeks before they would feel such pain from a California boycott that they would be forced to lower prices. After making record profits last year, power wholesalers Enron, Reliant, Dynegy, Duke Energy, Williams and Mirant and earned a combined $1.6 billion during the first three months of this year. --- On The Net: Bay Area Economic Forum report: http://www.bayareacouncil.org/ppi/enp/enp-mid.html Electric Power Research Institute: http://www.epri.com Utility Consumers' Action Network Report: http://www.ucan.org/cartelrep2.htm INDIA: Indian banks appeal to govt to help end Enron row 05/03/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. BOMBAY, May 3 (Reuters) - Indian lenders to U.S. energy group Enron Corp's gas-fired power plant south of Bombay have appealed to the Indian government to help end the company's row with a state-owned electricity board over pricing and upaid bills. The board of Enron's Indian unit, Dabhol Power Co (DPC) has authorised management to stop selling power to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) if a bitter dispute over pricing and unpaid bills cannot be resolved. In the past half year the MSEB has defaulted on bills for electricity supplied by Dabhol, which operates the world's largest gas-fired plant on the west coast of India, 160 kilometres (100 miles) south of Bombay. Indian financial institutions, which contributed $1.4 billion towards the project in loans, are pressing the government to help end the crisis, a source told Reuters. ""We have asked the government for help. We are awaiting their reply,"" the source, who is employed with a large financial institution, said. The domestic lenders to the project are Industrial Development Bank of India , ICICI Ltd , Industrial Finance Corporation of India , Canara Bank and State Bank of India . The Dabhol Power Company (DPC), owned 65 percent by Enron, last month took the major step of bailing out of the $2.9 billion power project, citing non-payment of bills by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). The DPC board's move sparked widespread fears that India's image as a safe destination for foreign direct investment would be damaged. POWER STRUGGLE MSEB, which is a state-owned utility, has been a regular defaulter on payments to DPC saying that it finds the power too costly. It has also backed out on its commitment to buy more power to be produced by the project's second phase which is to begin operations later this year. Last month MSEB said it had paid Dabhol Power 1.34 billion rupees ($28.60 million) for electricity it bought in March. But the payment only partially resolves the total overdue amount of 2.26 billion rupees ($48.2 million), which Enron has been unable to collect even after invoking guarantees issued by the government of Maharashtra, India's most industrialised state, and the federal government. The state utility still owes Enron payments for power purchases in December and January. The Indian government has maintained that the contract must be renegotiated and has set up a committee to do so. ""We are concerned and would like the renegotiations to happen fast,"" the source added. The dispute has raised fears that Enron could pull the plug on the project, cease providing power to the local state electricity board and perhaps even sell the plant. ""The plant is good, Maharashtra needs power and I am sure buyers can be found,"" the source added. ($1=46.82 Indian rupees). DNC: Special Interests Write Bush Energy Policy 05/03/2001 PR Newswire (Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire) WASHINGTON, May 3 /PRNewswire/ -- The Democratic National Committee issued the following today: Dick Cheney began dropping hints this week as to what the Bush energy policy will look like, and it is long on oil and short on conservation. But something was missing from the coverage of Cheney's announcement: not just who benefits from the Bush plan, but who's writing it as well. (Photo: http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20000107/DCF015 ) It's hard to understate the influence big donors and high-ranking executives have with the Bush Administration. Take Tom Kuhn, for example, one of the energy executives who came calling when Bush was thinking about actually following through on his pledge to limit carbon dioxide levels. Kuhn, a top Bush fundraiser, also served on Bush's Energy Department transition advisory team, and still enjoys access to the highest reaches of the Bush White House. Not surprisingly then, the Big Oil Bush Administration's energy policy could not make Bush's huge donors and the special interests in the energy business any happier. Since the energy industry's problems are Bush's problems, the first things on Bush's hit list are the environmental regulations that keep Big Energy in check -- and our country clean. With an energy executive running around the West Wing, Bush's energy policy could be summed up as, ""Drill anywhere, anytime, and keep those checks coming."" The Democratic Party is committed to fighting for a balanced energy policy that keeps our country's priorities -- such as a clean environment -- in mind. To learn more about Bush's misplaced priorities and kowtows to the special interests, keep reading to find out the ""Top Ten Paybacks To The Energy Industry,"" and to see how you, too, can get on the Bush gravy train in ""Recipe for a Quid Pro Quo,"" courtesy of the Democratic Party's http://www.100DaysofBush.com. BUSH'S TOP TEN PAYBACKS TO THE ENERGY INDUSTRY One of the most obvious and recurring themes of Bush's first 100 days has been the extraordinary influence the oil and gas industry has had in the new administration. Oil and gas interests are some of Bush's top campaign contributors, giving more than $3 million to get Bush elected. In exchange, Bush has rolled back regulations issued by the Clinton administration on such things as air conditioner efficiency, as well as breaking his campaign promise to regulate carbon dioxide emissions. Bush has proposed drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and national monuments. Bush has taken a backseat when it comes to the energy crisis California is experiencing, while cutting funding for energy conservation programs. He has also repaid top donors, lobbyists and industry officials with key positions throughout his administration. Here is just a sampling of how the oil, gas and other energy industries have benefited in Bush's first 100 days: 2 - BUSH TAKES HANDS-OFF APPROACH TO CALIFORNIA CRISIS WHILE ENERGY COMPANIES MAKE MILLIONS Bush Did Little to Aid California in Energy Crisis; Fleischer Said Crisis is a ""California Matter."" Bush has done little to aid California in its energy crisis, such as refusing to support wholesale price caps on electricity. White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said, ""The president continues to believe that the issue is mostly a California matter, dealing with the legislation that is before the state. And the leaders of California are working to address that in their own right."" Fleischer also said that Bush wanted to focus on a ""long term"" national energy policy. (AAP Newsfeed, 1/23/01; Wall Street Journal, 1/23/01) Texas Energy Company Accused of Price Gouging to Make Money off California's Energy Crisis. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered further inquiry into allegations by California officials that El Paso Natural Gas Co., a Houston based subsidiary of El Paso Energy Co., manipulated the natural gas market by keeping supply artificially low, contributing to the high price of electricity in the state. El Paso Energy was one of the Texas firms ""grandfathered"" by Bush's voluntary emissions standards in Texas. Between 1993 and 1998, El Paso Energy and El Paso Natural Gas PACs gave a total of $8,000 to Bush's gubernatorial campaigns. During the 1999-2000 election cycle, El Paso Energy Corp. and El Paso Natural Gas Co. gave a total of $743,029 to Bush and the GOP -- $460,395 to GOP in soft money, $247,750 to GOP candidates from its PAC, and $34,884 to the Bush campaign from its employees and executives.

LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - British utility Innogy said on Thursday it had started trading wholesale electricity on the French-Italian border and was set to enter the German power market. ""We have done some wholesale trading on the Italy-France border, moving power from France to Italy, and we are very close to doing some in Germany,"" said director of trading Tony West in an interview with Reuters. ""This year we will significantly increase our trading in (mainland) Europe; we are discussing relationships with counterparties at the moment,"" he added. Innogy is building a European power trading team at its headquarters in Swindon, southern England, from where it already trades the UK gas and power markets. FRANCE COULD BE KEY MARKET West said the company initially had expected the main focus of its European trading strategy to be Germany and the north west of the continent. But the early signs were that France would also play a key role, particularly as Innogy had gained access to capacity in the UK-France undersea interconnector cable. ""France has taken me by surprise. It might be more important than we anticipated although there are clearly still issues about the speed of liberalisation,"" said West. A core of about eight companies regularly trade power in France, including TXU Europe, Enron and a trading alliance between Endesa and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, according to traders. West said Innogy had so far concentrated on buying power in France, not always from French companies, and taking it to Italy via the cross border interconnector between the two countries. Innogy had bought some of the 400-megawatts available on the interconnector through recent auctions, he said. ""It's easy to trade through France, the cost of taking power through to the border is minuscule, although buying power in France and then selling it in France is a lot more difficult,"" said West. He said Innogy had signed grid balancing agreements with French transmission grid operator RTE. Andy Duff, managing director of generation and trading, added France could become become important for Innogy on a retail level, as well as a trading level, depending on how effectively the UK-France interconnector could be used. ""The European market will be driven by the operation of interconnectors and transmission services as well as exchanges,"" said Duff. Innogy may look to trade on Germany's two power exchanges as well as that country's burgeoning over-the-counter market. The company is in the process of signing standard trading agreements for Germany based on the terms devised by the industry group the European Federation of Energy Traders (EFET). FOCUS ON TRADING, NOT ASSETS Duff said Innogy's strategy in Europe was to focus on trading but not the acquisition of physical assets. ""We are not going to lead with assets in Europe. We will focus on trading services-type arrangements, extracting value from (other companies') assets. That's the main thrust of the business,"" he said. West said Innogy's trading in mainland Europe would expand into natural gas as opportunities emerged. The company already trades around the UK-Belgium gas interconnector. Mosaic Group posts strong first quarter results 05/03/2001 Canada NewsWire (Copyright Canada NewsWire 2001) -- Diluted Cash Earnings per Share Increases by 29% and Revenues up by 89% -- TORONTO, May 3 /CNW/ - Mosaic Group Inc. (MGX:TSE), Canada's leading outsourced marketing services agency, announced today that it continued its trend of strong earnings growth for the period ending March 31, 2001. Posting its 18th consecutive quarter of year over year revenue growth, Mosaic has also reported an average quarterly organic growth rate of 27% since 1996. Financial highlights from continuing operations(x) for this quarter include: - Revenues at $171.8 million - up 89% or $80.7 million from Q1 2000. ""Mosaic has consistently outpaced the growth of its peers within an industry that is clearly expanding,"" said Mike Preston, Chairman and CEO Mosaic Group Inc. ""We have posted 18 consecutive quarters of continued growth while adding to our blue chip client list. We are building our business by taking our clients' business farther every time we deal with them. Our organic growth comes not only from securing new client wins, but from the cross-selling wins that are characteristic of a mature company able to leverage a robust and diverse range of service offerings."" New Client Wins In the first quarter of 2001, Mosaic's newly acquired business unit Paradigm, has secured new client business worth between $20 million and $25 million a year in revenue. Combined with new client wins from Mosaic's other business units, and increases in spending from some existing clients, Mosaic has made significant progress in closing its new business gap for 2001. New Power --------- During the first quarter of 2001, Paradigm signed a contract with New Power to acquire residential and commercial customers through a variety of direct response channels such as outbound telemarketing, inbound telemarketing, direct mail and ""feet on the street"". New Power was formed by Enron Corp., the largest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas in North America. Paradigm had previously provided contract marketing services to New Power. Through diligent effort, Paradigm was able to expand the contract to include the performance-based customer acquisition component. /For further information: Please Contact: Clint Becker, Chief Financial Officer, Mosaic Group Inc., (416) 813-4275, email: beckerc(at)mosaicgroupinc.com; Donna Cox-Davies, Director of Communications, Mosaic Group Inc., (416) 813-4279, Email: cox-daviesd(at)mosaicgroupinc.com/ 16:10 ET European Phone Companies' Outlook Brightens: Rates of Return 2001-05-03 08:52 (New York) European Phone Companies' Outlook Brightens: Rates of Return London, May 3 (Bloomberg) -- European telephone companies such as British Telecommunications Plc and Deutsche Telekom AG have improved their ability to pay back debt in recent weeks, making their bonds a buy, investors said. ``Sentiment seems to be changing,'' said Anna Lees-Jones, who helps manage about 28 billion pounds ($40 billion) of corporate bonds at M&G Investment Management. ``I've been building up my telecoms position all year.'' British Telecom's 10-year euro-denominated bonds sold in January yield about 214 basis points more than government debt, down from a record 238 in March. Contracts that pay out if the company goes bankrupt have also fallen in the past month, according to Enron Corp., which trades the derivatives. Bond yields and bankruptcy derivatives have also declined for Deutsche Telekom and Royal KPN NV, after the companies said they would sell assets to pay down debt that has pushed their credit ratings to record lows and weighed on their shares. Phone companies sold $100 billion of bonds last year to finance licenses and equipment for new mobile services. British Telecom said yesterday it will sell its stakes in Japan Telecom Co. and Spain's Airtel SA to Vodafone Group for 4.8 billion pounds. British Telecom may also sell as much as 7.5 billion pounds of shares to existing investors in a so-called rights offer, according to Legal & General Group Plc, one of the company's shareholders. Deutsche Telekom will sell assets such as cable television, and a stake in Global One and Wind SpA, Chief Financial Officer Karl-Gerhard Eick said last week. KPN, the biggest Dutch phone company, said on March 26 it plans to raise at least 5 billion euros from asset sales to lower debt. Those plans have helped shift investors' perceptions of the companies' creditworthiness, money managers said. `Drastic Measures' ``At the beginning of the year the market was assuming telecoms companies would be downgraded from single-A to triple- B,'' said Peter Harvey, who helps run about $8.6 billion at F&C Management. ``Drastic measures such as deeply-discounted rights issues led investors to believe they will maintain their single-A status.'' The gap, or spread, between British Telecom's sterling denominated bonds maturing in 2006, and U.K. five-year government bonds has narrowed 50 basis points to 109 basis points in the past month. Spreads between Deutsche Telekom's 6.125 percent five- year euro bonds and German government debt narrowed 35 basis points to 107 in April. Bankruptcy Swaps Fall Those shifts in sentiment are also reflected in Enron's bankruptcy swaps, where prices have fallen in the past month, said Simon Brooks, a trader at Enron. Enron prices the swaps using indexes that measure the probability of bankruptcy and the likely recovery rate in that event. The price is expressed as a percentage above a benchmark interest rate such as the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. British Telecom bankruptcy swaps have declined to 66 basis points from 96 on April 1, Enron said. Bankruptcy swaps on Deutsche Telekom dropped to 78 from 100, while KPN's fell to 135 from 183. Over the same period, France Telecom SA's declined to 70 from 100 and Telecom Italia SpA's fell to 94 from 119. British Telecom's bond yields may fall further relative to government debt, analysts said. They still offer higher yields than those of rival Vodafone Group Plc, which has the same ratings though with a stable outlook. While both companies have five-year euro-denominated bonds, British Telecom's offer 55 basis points more yield. The rivals also both have bonds maturing in 2004, and Vodafone's yield about 23 basis points fewer. ``If BT retains their rating, their spreads should be probably 20 to 30 basis points narrower,'' said Brian Venables, head of credit strategy at WestLB. ``Even though it has performed extremely well this year, there is much greater potential for BT's debt.'' Debt Reduction Target Both Moody's Investors Service, which rates British Telecom ``A2'', and Standard & Poor's, which rates it ``A'', have those ratings on watch for further cuts after trimming them four rungs last year. The company's asset sales to Vodafone are ``definitely positive in terms of the rating assessment,'' said Aidan Fisher, who rates British Telecom for Moody's. In combination with the proceeds of a rights sale, ``that would meet the target they set themselves this year -- that's quite a lot to achieve in a 12 month period.'' British Telecom has said it wants to slash its 30 billion pounds of debt by a third and fend off further rating cuts. Before companies such as British Telecom clarified their debt-reduction plans, ``the world and his wife were underweight'' telecom bonds in March, said Harvey at F&C. The investment firm has since raised its holding of telecom bonds to neutral, from underweight, relative to its benchmark, he said. Bond yields ``were trading very much out of line to the rest of the market,'' said Lees-Jones at M&G. Now, ``they have come in quite a bit and will come in further.'' --Tom Kohn and Alice James in the London newsroom (44-20) 7330 7929 or at tkohn@bloomberg.net, with reporting by Christine Harper /zls Story illustration: {CRED <GO>} to see credit analysis on Bloomberg. {BRITEL <Corp> <GO>} for BT's bonds. {DT <Corp> <GO>} for Deutsche Telekom's bonds. UK:Corporates warm to charms of credit derivatives By Tom Bergin 05/03/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - European corporates are beginning to turn to credit derivatives, among the more esoteric and complex of financial instruments, to hedge the risk their debtors won't pay up, market participants said on Thursday. Credit derivatives are insurance-like tools that allow users to hedge the risk of default on a debt. They are mainly used by banks, hedge funds and insurance companies to hedge or gain exposure to the risk of a bond issuer defaulting. Dealers said an environment of deteriorating credit quality and a growing awareness among corporates that credit derivatives offer certain advantages over established hedging tools was behind the increasing use of the instruments. The market remains small, with only around a dozen non-financial European corporates regularly using credit derivatives to manage their credit portfolio at present. But market professionals predict they will one day become as commonplace in the corporate world as other hedging tools such as interest rate swaps and currency options. ""We see (corporate use) as a big growth area for credit derivatives, maybe the biggest,"" says Bryan Seyfried, vice-president of Enron Credit in London. Enron Credit grew out of the efforts of energy company Enron Corp. to hedge its own credit risk portfolio and now specialises in marketing credit risk management solutions to other non-financial corporates. Ralf Lierow, director of credit derivatives at Siemens Financial Services in Munich, said the ability to buy and sell in a liquid market means credit derivatives offer a flexibility that established tools like credit insurance and forfaiting guarantees lack. Credit derivatives were are often cheaper than the alternatives, too, he added. ""This is not a trading book thing. For us, the credit default swap is another tool for credit risk management,"" Lierow said. HELPS OPERATIONAL UNITS DO MORE BUSINESS Siemens Financial Services acts as the centralised risk portfolio management operation for companies within the Siemens electronics and industrial group. It first started using credit derivatives in July 2000. Large companies like Siemens can have hundreds of millions of dollars in receivables on their books at any time. The efficiency with which these companies manage the credit risk on their receivables has an impact on their day to day business. ""The advantage for the operative area is that they can offload more receivables and do more business,"" Lierow said. Siemens uses credit default swaps, the most liquid type of credit derivatives, to hedge its portfolio of debtors on a constant basis. As the balance of cash owed by each name fluctuates over time, the company tries to match this with default swap positions. Hence, if a customer fails to pay, Siemens can recoup the debt from the default swap seller. Other companies use credit derivatives less frequently. ""There are occasional corporate users that have secured one-off requirements for balance-sheet management aims or to strip out the credit risk of a commercial transaction,"" said Walter Gontarek, head of global credit products at RBC Dominion Securities. By hedging a country or company risk which a corporate may not be comfortable in carrying, a credit derivative can facilitate a project that may otherwise be unfeasible, dealers said. NOT PUT OFF BY BAD PRESS Corporates' adoption of credit derivatives is in spite of the negative publicity the instruments have received in recent years. A number of disputes over whether protection buyers could force banks to pay up on contracts have ended up in court. However, traders insist that subsequent work done on contract documentation minimises the risk of such disputes in future. Nonetheless a very practical concern for corporates remains, in that credit derivatives documentation was designed by bankers with sovereign and corporate bonds in mind. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) standard documentation for credit default swaps allows for a pay-out in relation to defaults on bond payments but not on a private debtor's failure to pay. ""We use the ISDA framework but we need it redrafted in specific ways to fit our needs. You cannot take a standard contract and trade on it if you want to hedge trade receivables,"" Lierow said. These amendments add to the cost of the credit derivative. Another problem that corporates face is the complexity of credit derivatives. There is little experience of the instruments, which are barely a decade old, in the corporate world. Siemens had to get its expertise from the financial markets, hiring Lierow from Bankgesellschaft Berlin. Clive Banks, UK head of derivatives sales to buy-side clients at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, said much of the effort in marketing credit derivatives to corporates involves educating them about the products and the risks involved. ""It's about explaining credit risk management and what kind of volatility and cost having credit risk introduces,"" he said. OUTLOOK PROMISING Yet some corporates are beginning to take full advantage of their new tool. Lierow said that Siemens, which currently only buys credit protection, planned to start acting as a default swaps seller in the coming months. He said selling would facilitate better matching of protection levels to actual exposures, and would enable diversification of risk away from industry sectors where the company's activities are concentrated. ""You could improve the portfolio mix by buying protection on automotives and selling protection on pharmaceuticals,"" he said. Allegheny Energy buys three power plants 05/03/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. HAGERSTOWN, Md. (AP) - Allegheny Energy Inc. said Thursday it has purchased three power plants from Houston-based Enron Corp. The company said it issued more than 14 million shares of common stock worth $667 million to pay for the transaction. The plants are in Tennessee, Indiana and Illinois. The Midwestern purchase will bring an additional 1,710 megawatts on line. The company is expected to own 14,000 megawatts of generating power by 2005. Allegheny also has plans to build natural gas-fired facilities in Arizona, Indiana and Pennsylvania. Allegheny Energy is the parent of Allegheny Power, which supplies electricity and natural gas to 3 million people in Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. Allegheny Energy Buys Midwest Capacity From Enron Unit 05/03/2001 Dow Jones News Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) HAGRSTOWN, Md. -(Dow Jones)- Allegheny Energy Inc.'s (AYE) Allegheny Energy Supply Co. unit purchased 1,710 megawatts of natural gas-fired merchant generating capacity in three Midwest states from Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Enron North America unit. Financial terms weren't disclosed. In a press release Thursday, Allegheny said it financed the acquisition through debt and equity and expects the purchase to add to earnings in 2001, excluding transaction costs. Allegheny noted that this latest acquisition gives Allegheny Energy Supply more than 14,000 MW of total generating capacity that it will own or control by 2005. Allegheny Energy Global Markets will market output from the three facilities. On April 27, Allegheny priced its public offering of 12.4 million shares at $48.25 each, and said it would use the $598.3 million in gross proceeds to fund its previously reported acquisition of generating facilities located in the Midwest and for other corporate purposes. New York Stock Exchange-listed shares of Allegheny recently traded at $49.85, down 51 cents, or 1%, on composite volume of 306,000 shares. Average daily volume is 538,773 shares. Allegheny, which posted an operating net of $313.7 million, or $2.84 a share, on revenue of $4.01 billion for the year ended Dec. 31, is an energy company.

Chow; Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5400 Allegheny Energy Supply Completes Purchase of Midwest Assets; Adds 1,700 MW to Growing Generation Fleet 05/03/2001 Business Wire (Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire) HAGERSTOWN, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 3, 2001--Allegheny Energy, Inc. (NYSE: AYE) today announced that its unregulated generation subsidiary, Allegheny Energy Supply Company, LLC, has completed the purchase of 1,710 megawatts of natural gas-fired merchant generating capacity in three Midwest states from Enron North America, a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE). The acquisition gives Allegheny Energy more than 14,000 MW of total generating capacity that it will own or control by 2005 and marks a significant step in the Company's strategic course toward becoming a national energy supplier. Earlier this year, Allegheny Energy Supply acquired 83 MW of coal-fired generation in the Conemaugh Generating Facility near Johnstown, Pa. Additionally, the Company has announced plans to build a 1,080-MW natural gas combined-cycle plant in La Paz County, Ariz.; a 630-MW natural gas combined-cycle facility near South Bend, Ind.; and a 540-MW natural gas fired combined-cycle generating facility in Springdale, Pa. Another 220 MW of peaking capacity have already been completed in Pennsylvania. The Midwest acquisition was financed through a combination of debt and equity and will be accretive to Allegheny Energy's earnings in 2001, excluding transaction costs and other costs related to the integration. Yesterday, the Company issued more than 14 million shares of common stock to facilitate the transaction. Alan J. Noia, Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Allegheny Energy, said, ""I am pleased to announce the closing of Allegheny Energy's largest generation acquisition to date. It provides our Company with significant generation presence and capability as an energy merchant to sell electricity from efficient natural gas-fired generation facilities in more areas of the country with a growing demand for energy."" Output from the three facilities will be marketed by Allegheny Energy Global Markets. ""These premium generating assets are designed for operation in times of peak electricity demand,"" said Noia. ""Because of its national presence, Allegheny Energy Global Markets will be able to market the output from these newly acquired facilities in a wide variety of ways with our portfolio of existing assets and other supply arrangements so that overall operational efficiency and shareholder value is maximized."" Allegheny Energy Supply's newly acquired facilities include: the Gleason, Tenn., plant (546 MW), approximately 40 miles north of Jackson, Tenn.; the Wheatland, Ind., plant (508 MW), approximately 70 miles northeast of Evansville, Ind.; and the Lincoln Energy Center plant (656 MW) in Manhattan, Ill., near Chicago. These assets give Allegheny Energy Supply additional generating capacity within the East Central Area Reliability region (ECAR) and initial generation sources in the Mid-America Interconnected Network (MAIN) and the Southeastern Electric Reliability Council (SERC). Salomon Smith Barney acted as financial advisor and Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue acted as legal counsel for Allegheny Energy for the acquisition.

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Salomon Smith Barney's utility analysts sharply cut their forecast of the profitability of generating electricity in the U.S. in 2002 and beyond because power prices are expected to drop more sharply than natural gas prices starting next year. The analysts cut the profit margin in natural gas-fired power in 2003 to $3.98 a megawatt-hour from $8.73/MWh, a 54% difference from their last forecast in February. They lowered their power price index for 2002 by 1.5% and for 2003 by 7.1% Thursday in a published report. Their forecast is based on forward markets for electricity and gas. ""Gas prices are remaining strong for a much longer period of time, while power prices drop off,"" senior electricity industry analyst Raymond Niles said in a telephone conference with investors. As a result, stock prices for power producers such as AES Corp. (AES), Mirant (MIR), Calpine Corp. (CPN) and NRG Energy (NRG) could peak this summer in advance of strong third quarter earnings reports, the Salomon report says. ""Investors may still shy away from asset and investment-heavy power producers if realized prices begin to reflect the decreases in power prices now projected in the forward curve,"" the report warns. After this summer, the stocks of energy companies that focus more on trading will regain momentum, Salomon expects. These ""energy merchant"" companies, such as Enron Corp. (ENE), Williams Cos. (WMB), Duke Energy (DUK) and Dynegy (DYN), should be able to take advantage of higher trading volume and greater volatility in power markets in non-summer months, according to Salomon. ""We expect (annual trading) volumes to grow, industry-wide, between 25% and 40%, on average, during 2001-03, as the $800 billion global energy commodity market continues to open,"" the report predicts. The overall electricity price trend is national, according to Salomon. The report, titled ""Power Curve,"" expects 2001 wholesale power prices to exceed last year's by 131% in the West and by 34% on average in the eastern U.S., including Texas. But since their last forecast, the analysts lowered their forward price curve for next year and beyond in 10 of 11 regional power pools. ""Interestingly, the exception to that is the New York Power Pool,"" Niles told investors. For the remainder of this year, however, Salomon still expects power producers to beat substantially last year's breakthrough results. ""About 50% of the spike upward in western U.S. power prices the past six months has been from something we've never seen before in this industry: political and credit risk,"" Niles said in the conference. Western merchant power suppliers are benefitting from the ""unholy mess in California,"" Niles said, but that won't last forever. ""Whenever the debate tapers off and we have a resolution in sight, that premium will slowly drain out of the western markets, and bring down profitability for the group,"" Niles said. National calls for reregulation due to the California crisis could continue to hurt stock prices for the entire sector, even though reregulation won't happen. Further, in so far as such calls discourage investment in generating plants, transmission lines and gas pipelines, they could also extend the current period of extremely high earnings, according to the report. In non-western states, the greatest profitability from power generation for the next two years is seen in New England. -By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.com Fitch Affs Northern Border; Rtg Outlook To Stable From Negative 05/03/2001 Business Wire (Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire) NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 3, 2001--Fitch has affirmed its `BBB+' senior debt rating for Northern Border Partners, L.P. (NBP) and its `A-` senior debt rating for its regulated pipeline affiliate Northern Border Pipeline Co. (NBPL). The Rating Outlook for both companies is changed to Stable from Negative. The rating action was taken after a review of NBP's recent acquisitions and long-term business plan. A combination of debt and equity at NBP was used to fund the recent acquisitions of Bear Paw, LLC, Midwestern Gas Transmission Company, and Dynegy Canada midstream assets. An additional $125-150 million of equity is expected to be sold in the coming months to pay down short-term debt and complete the permanent financing. The improvement in Rating Outlook primarily reflects NBP's demonstrated commitment to undertake conservative long-term financing and operating strategies. Future acquisitions at the partnership level are expected to be financed 50/50, debt/equity so as to maintain financial flexibility and a stable credit profile. Moreover, management has shown a strong bias to minimize commodity price risk as it expands its non-regulated gas operations. For example, processing contracts for Bear Paw's four processing facilities are contracted for on a percentage of proceeds basis and liquids prices have been 90% hedged by NBP through 2001, limiting downside exposure. NBPL continues to exhibit strong competitive market, operating, and financial characteristics that are consistent with its current `A-` rating. The company is a low-cost transporter of Canadian gas into the Midwest, with costs per hundred miles of less than 4 cents per mcf. The December 2000 completion of the Alliance Pipeline has had minimal impact on Northern Border as capacity utilization approaches 100%. Pipeline capacity is 99% subscribed through mid-September 2003. Its shippers are financially strong customers with uniform take-or-pay contracts. The company has never written off a bad debt. NBPL should generate EBITDA/interest coverage of nearly 4.0 times over the next few years. Credit concerns primarily relate to NBP's changing business mix and the expectation of increased market risk associated with its growing midstream operations as compared with the stable, low-risk profile of NBPL. While projected consolidated and stand alone credit measures at NBP remain relatively strong, there will be less predictability in the future cash stream utilized to service debt. NBP is a publicly traded master limited partnership. Its primary holding is a 70% economic interest in NBPL, a 1,214-mile FERC regulated interstate pipeline transporting natural gas from the Canadian border to the upper Midwest. Enron Corp. and The Williams Companies, Inc. hold a 10.0% and 3.3% stake in NBP, respectively, with the remainder publicly held. Enron controls an 82.5% stake in the management committee of NBP with Williams holding the remaining management allocation.

NEW DELHI, May 3 (Reuters) - The Indian unit of Enron Corp said on Thursday that its officials would meet members of a government panel formed to re-negotiate a troubled $2.9 billion power project in western India. But the willingness to meet the panel next week should not be construed as an offer to renegotiate the contract, Dabhol Power Company (DPC) said in a statement. ""As a matter of courtesy we have agreed to meet with them next week,"" the DPC statement said. ""Since the purpose of our meeting is to hear out the committee and understand their thoughts, we will not present any proposal."" DPC said it had constantly maintained that it was open to maintaining a dialogue towards resolving issues. ""(But) This meeting should in no manner be construed as an open offer from DPC to renegotiate the terms of the contract,"" it added. DPC and the government of the western state of Maharashtra have been locked in a payment battle for months, with the state's electricity board balking at paying Enron what it considers too high a rate for electricity. At present, Maharashtra's State Electricity Board (MSEB) owes the DPC, of which Enron is a 65 percent stakeholder, some $48 million for power. The Maharashtra government last week announced the formation of a panel of experts to re-negotiate its contract with DPC and lower the cost of power sold to MSEB. LARGEST FOREIGN INVESTMENT The Dabhol project, the single largest foreign investment in India, consists of two phases, the already-built 740 megawatt power plant and a 1,444 MW plant that is expected to be finished this year. Last week, Dabhol's board authorised the plant's managing director to issue a preliminary notice of termination of service to MSEB. The notice, which has not been issued, would be the first step for Enron to pull out of the project. Earlier, a source familiar with the project told Reuters that Indian lenders, who have provided millions of dollars to Houston-based Enron to build DPC are lobbying with the government to act quickly and end the crisis. ""We have asked the government for help. We are awaiting their reply,"" the source, who is employed with a large financial institution, said. The domestic lenders to the project are Industrial Development Bank of India , ICICI Ltd , Industrial Finance Corporation of India , Canara Bank and State Bank of India . If Enron pulls out of the project, the source said, the lenders would have no choice but to seek an alternative buyer. ""The plant is good, Maharashtra needs power and I am sure buyers can be found,"" the source added. India State Panel's Sat Meet With Enron Unit Postponed 05/03/2001 Dow Jones International News (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India's Maharashtra state government's expert committee's Saturday meeting with the U.S. energy major Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Indian unit Dabhol Power Co. has been postponed until May 11 at the request of DPC, a committee member told Dow Jones Newswires late Thursday. The nine-member committee has been appointed to renegotiate the Maharashtra State Electricity Board's controversial power purchase agreement with DPC. The state government has asked the committee to try to negotiate a revised agreement within a month. ""The negotiating committee's first meeting with the Dabhol Power Co. management scheduled for Saturday has been postponed until May 11, 0530 GMT, at DPC's request. They (DPC) told us they wanted some more time to prepare themselves for the meeting and we have granted their request,"" said a committee member. The committee's goals are to lower the power tariff and allow the sale of excess power to the federal government or its utilities. A restructure of the DPC's stakeholding may also be on the agenda. -By Himendra Kumar, Dow Jones Newswires; 91-11-461-9427; himendra.kumar@dowjones.com EnergieKontor Secures Enron Deal For Spain, Germany Projs 05/03/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) LONDON -(Dow Jones)- German wind farm developer EnergieKontor AG said Thursday it has signed a framework agreement with Enron Wind GmbH for deliveries of wind turbines for projects in Germany and Spain. In all, Enron will deliver 200 megawatts' worth of 1.5 MW turbines for onshore projects in EnergieKontor's home market and in Spain, one of its fastest-growing export markets. In addition, Neuer Markt-listed EnergieKontor said it has entered into exclusive negotiations with the local authorities for permission to build up to 15 wind farms at a number of sites in the Castilla-La Mancha region. Each site would have an installed capacity of 45-50 MW, making a total of 700 MW. ""Once we reach this stage there is about an 85-90% of the project going ahead, sometimes more,"" a spokesman told Dow Jones. EnergieKontor said it assumes that it will set up the first windfarms in Castilla-La Mancha as early as next year. -By Geoffrey T. Smith, Dow Jones Newswires; (+44 20) 7842 9260; -geoffrey.smith@dowjones.com The Bottom Line: Scottish Power Looks To Refine Focus By Andrea Chipman Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 05/03/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) LONDON -(Dow Jones)- After more than a year of lagging earnings, investment missteps and unexpected disasters, U.K. vertically-integrated utility Scottish Power (SPI) is hoping a new strategy to streamline its businesses will signal a more focused period for the company. But it's got its work cut out. While investors were cheered by news that its U.S. Utah-based Hunter power plant is back online after a six-month outage that cost the company an estimated $160 million, uncertainty over its plans for its Southern Water unit and apparent ongoing commitment to loss-making telecoms venture Thus are seen as muddling group focus. ""It all adds up - the lack of coherent strategy, quite substantial downgrades and a whole host of non-core businesses that they don't have any natural management flair or expertise in,"" said Brian Gallagher, a senior fund manager at London-based Gartmore Investment Management, which has GBP3 million of Scottish Power shares in its Global Utilities Fund. ""We have a reasonably low opinion of the company."" The company said Thursday that its pretax profit before goodwill amortization and exceptional items for the fiscal year ending March 31 fell to GBP628 million from GBP736 million a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share declined to 30.65 pence in the 2001 fiscal year from 41.22 pence in 2000. The company acknowledged profits have been hit hard by the Hunter outage, competition on wholesale and retail markets in the U.K. and strict price controls on its regulated infrastructure businesses. Although the company's shares were trading at 458.5 pence after the release of Thursday's earnings results, up from 441.5 pence Wednesday, they are down more than 15% from 533 pence a year ago. Executives say they are restructuring the business into three targeted divisions to capitalize on its traditional strengths in generation and power supply and infrastructure and to expand its overseas activities. ""We've now got a trading and commercial link between generation and supply and the first thing we are doing is putting emphasis on that...on growing earnings across that value chain,"" Scottish Power Chief Executive Ian Russell told journalists in a conference call Thursday. ""In the U.S., we are focused on cost cutting and on acquiring new businesses."" Scottish Power's move away from a full multi-utility profile - begun last year with its partial disposal of Thus and its withdrawal from an Internet banking venture with the Royal Bank of Scotland - toward a more narrowly focused energy business mimics a trend across the industry toward greater specialization. The company is also considering selling Southern Water, which would allow it to focus even more closely on its power business. Yet analysts and investors say they are looking for more details of the company's overall growth strategy from Russell, who took over as chief executive last month, and other managers. The toll from months of drift, is evident, they said. Sales Of Southern Water, Thus Seen Indeed, despite its efforts to chart a new road, Scottish Power appears to be reluctant to acknowledge the failure of some of its non-core ventures. Russell said his company remains ""supportive"" of Thus, which reported a 2000 fiscal year loss of GBP21.4 million this week, and has no plans to exit its remaining 50% stake in the company. Similarly, he said, Scottish Power hasn't yet made a final decision to dispose of Southern Water - which has cut costs under its Scottish parent but is increasingly unable to cover its capital expenditure - although he said the company had received ""a number of offers"" from potential buyers. Although he declined to identify any of the bidders, Italian energy company Enel SpA (ENI) has confirmed its interest. Industry sources said a prompt sale of the water unit looks likely, with some bids already exceeding the GBP2 billion at which many analysts value the company's combined assets and debt. It's unclear, they said, how Southern Water or Thus would fit into Scottish Power's new image. ""Scottish Power sees itself as an international energy company,"" a source familiar with the company said. In a year's time, he added, ""it would be unlikely that Southern Water and Thus would be part of the company."" Revenues from the sale of the water unit would also help Scottish Power pursue its U.S. expansion without adding to its 90% gearing levels, analysts and investors said. Russell declined to comment on reports Scottish Power is considering buying Enron Corp.'s Oregon-based unit, Portland General, but admitted the company would be a logical geographical fit with Pacificorp. Analysts said Scottish Power's plans for U.S. growth is likely to be a key part of its energy strategy. ""We like their U.S. strategy where they've leveraged expertise gained in the highly competitive U.K. market,"" said Gareth Lewis-Davies, head of utilities research at Lehman Brothers in London. Closer to home, competition and the trend toward increased specialization in the power industry may force Scottish Power to determine whether its business strength lies in asset management or retail and generation. ""Strategic decisions need to be made, and I'm not sure if they are going to make them in the near term or not,"" said Andrew Wright, U.K. utilities analyst at UBS Warburg in London. ""They are pretty much involved across the value chain, and I think it remains to be seen which part of the value chain they specialize in, if any.""

Similar letters were delivered by Greenpeace Europe in native languages to Enron's offices in the UK, Netherlands, Spain, and Belgium. I have attached a copy of one of the letters below. All the questions are the same in each. I have drafted a response with the goals of: 1) Being responsive to Greenpeace without being defensive or without ""greenwashing."" We have an already-published public ""statement"" on climate change and a very positive, solution-oriented story to tell, with many facts and accomplishments to back up our statements. I think our letter can land in the stack that they consider ""positive"" responses, and not in the stack of non-responses or ""we don't care"" responses. 2) Steering away from directly answering the no-win questions about ""Kyoto."" I think we can respond to the letter in a way that provides meaningful answers to the general themes of the letter. I have discussed this with many of you already, but I strongly feel that we should not get dragged down into debates over what we like/dislike, support/oppose about Kyoto....we'll quickly get into questions we can't now answer, and may never be able to answer. I'd prefer it if we rise above the politics of the issue and look solution-oriented by saying counties and companies should continue to be engaged in this important issue. 3) Developing corporate-wide messages that we can use in multiple applications -- arming our PR and govt. affairs advocates with a tight script to use in their efforts; responding to shareholder inquiries and annual meeting Q&A; Ken Lay or other executive speeches and presentations; something for our Corporate Responsibility annual report. Sorry for the long preamble, but climate change has become a very sensitive issue of late, and our message/strategy needs to be very coordinated and we need to have one clear set of statements that everyone in the company can understand and use. With that said, I also believe that these messages should be used very carefully, as the subject matter is complex and straying too far from the basics can be dangerous. We should designate one or two clear spokespeople that can answer any follow up to the Greenpeace letter by press or policymakers, and really stick to the boundaries of what's in our response letter. There is also the issue of customizing responses from the European offices, using this letter as a template and adding a few examples of Enron good deeds in the local areas. I am not opposed to doing so, but would again appreciate being able to review these responses before they go. Please let me know if you have other views. I would like to send our response by early next week, maybe even Monday 4/23 if we can turn it around that fast. Thank you for your input and assistance and I look forward to your reply.

Gray Davis' demand for $8.9 billion in refunds was too high and that a= =20 settlement probably would be in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion.=20 The disclosure that Wagner had contemplated a much higher figure midway=20 through the negotiations suggests the state had more support than the judge= =20 let on Monday when he said after the talks foundered that he thought a deal= =20 should involve ""hundreds of millions, maybe a billion"" dollars.=20 While the state wants $8.9 billion, $3 billion of that was for overcharges= =20 during the five months preceding last October and are beyond FERC's scope o= f=20 review.

TIM REITERMAN TIMES STAFF WRITER July 11 2001 SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge Tuesday reaffirmed his decision to bar a= =20 ratepayers committee from Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s bankruptcy case and= =20 denounced the committee's attorney for suggesting that the action could=20 prevent PG&E customers from receiving refunds for excessive energy charges. Judge Dennis Montali ruled against a U.S. trustee and the ratepayers=20 committee in deciding that ratepayers as a group had no claims and were not= =20 creditors when PG&E filed for bankruptcy on April 6. But Montali criticized ""misguided remarks"" by a committee attorney on July = 5=20 and news media accounts that followed the hearing. The judge said the repor= ts=20 left the misconception that by disallowing a ratepayers committee, he would= =20 reject all claims of ratepayers and they could lose out on future refunds. The judge and PG&E officials emphasized that there are no matters involving= =20 PG&E customer refunds before the state Public Utilities Commission. State officials are seeking about $9 billion in refunds, however, from the= =20 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for alleged overcharges to Californian= s=20 by energy companies since last year. The distribution of any ratepayer refunds would be decided by the PUC, and= =20 customers would be paid whether or not they filed Bankruptcy Court claims b= y=20 a Sept. 5 deadline, the judge and PG&E attorneys said. The judge took the highly unusual step of directing PG&E and U.S. Trustee= =20 Linda Ekstrom Stanley to consider remedies to allay any confusion among=20 PG&E's 5.5 million customers. He suggested publishing clarifications in newspapers that carried the=20 erroneous information, in PG&E customer bills and on Web sites. Stanley had formed a ratepayers committee of business, government and=20 consumer representatives, saying they will be affected by PG&E's Chapter 11= =20 reorganization. But Montali decided that ratepayers do not qualify as creditors under=20 bankruptcy law and are not entitled to official status that allows them to= =20 participate in the bankruptcy and receive funding from PG&E.

But other state officials conceded that= =20 only $5.4 billion of that is actually on the table in the FERC proceedings.= =20 Davis said he'll take what he can get there, and sue for the rest.=20 The state argues that because FERC has determined that wholesale prices hav= e=20 not met the Federal Power Act's requirement to be ``just and reasonable,''= =20 refunds are in order. But the commission has not defined what portion=20 exceeded ``just and reasonable.''=20 Throughout his press conference, Davis used the prospect of litigation like= a=20 goad to spur the federal regulators into action. But if you listened=20 carefully, he also indicated he'll give them more time to consider the case= .=20 Considering the iffy odds of winning in court, we suggest he keep goading t= he=20 federal commissioners -- while giving them all the time they need. Wednesday, July 11, 2001=20 Lights go out on Davis' power show=20 Three new developments show that some economic reality finally is being=20 applied to California's electricity crisis:=20 First, ""The nation's chief energy judge said Monday that California is owed= =20 maybe $1 billion in refunds from power generators, a fraction of the $8.9= =20 billion demanded by Gov. Gray Davis,"" reported the Register yesterday. Even= =20 that $1 billion amount might be balanced by the amount the state still owes= =20 the power producers.=20 To suggest workable and market-oriented solutions to the California=20 electricity crisis. Judge Curtis Wagner's recommendation will be taken up by the Federal Energy= =20 Regulatory Commission, which is being petitioned for the money by the state= =20 of California.=20 Because the judge's words will bolster FERC's apparent desire not to grant= =20 the ""refunds,"" the state probably will go to court, where the matter could = be=20 stuck for years. ""In the long term, this may indicate that competitive electricity has a=20 future even in California, but not thanks to the state,"" Robert Michaels, a= =20 professor of economics at Cal State Fullerton, told us. He's referring to t= he=20 state's botched 1996 ""deregulation"" effort, which has been made worse by Go= v.=20 Gray Davis and other officials since the crisis began a year ago. ""FERC since the 1980s favors competition, within the parameters of politica= l=20 reality,"" Mr. Michaels added. ""Now we're at square one: The industry doesn'= t=20 owe $9 billion to California."" As this process continues, he said, another= =20 positive aspect will be that a lot of facts will get aired. ""We'll see what= =20 has been happening in the markets"" in which power is bought and sold. Second, light already is shining on one area: This crisis was not ""Made in= =20 Texas'' by cronies of President Bush, as Gov. Davis and other Democrats hav= e=20 been contending.=20 In May, the governor attacked the president for ignoring ""the greed of thes= e=20 Texas energy companies,"" such as Reliant and Dynergy. In fact, according to information on state power contracts the governor=20 finally released Monday, Texas companies were way down on the list of=20 producers.=20 ""In roughly the first five months of the year, the state shelled out $1.2= =20 billion to Atlanta-based Mirant, the most any company was paid for=20 electricity, followed by $1 billion to Powerex, the marketing arm of BC Hyd= ro=20 in British Columbia [in Canada]. It also paid $331 million to the Los Angel= es=20 Department of Water and Power,"" reported the San Jose Mercury News. Only about 10 percent of our state's power during this period came from=20 companies with headquarters in Texas. Third, and finally, a new study by the Cato Institute shows what should be= =20 done next:=20 lAbolish retail rate caps, allowing prices to be set by the market.=20 This would be a better system than the present one, where the state buys th= e=20 electricity and passes much of the cost along through the state budget (pai= d=20 by taxpayers) and bonds paid for by long-term electricity price increases.= =20 Higher immediate prices would encourage conservation and production, leadin= g=20 in time to lower prices. lMove to real-time pricing so people shift activities such as washing to=20 off-peak hours.=20 lAbolish the Independent System Operator, which moves electrons around.=20 Give this function back to the utilities, who did it far better before=20 ""deregulation.""

We may not have a problem providing this information for use by FERC in its proceeding subject to a confidentiality agreement but I think we would oppose their requests for: the information to be provided for ""government eyes only"" - this would prohibit EPMI from defending itself vis-a-vis other market participants. a FERC confidentiality order that would could allow FERC to ""share"" this information with the CPUC (for purposes of the PUC's OII proceeding) pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 824h(c). 16 USC 824g(c) requires the Commission to make information available to state commissions as may be of assistance in state regulation of public utilities.

While we have not seen the text, we are told that it is ""anti-RTO"" and may go so far as to state or imply that FERC does not have authority to do what is doing with RTOs. (We know this is the view of one of Chairman Tauzin's counsels, who formerly worked for Southern Co.). Chairman Tauzin has been contacted by Entergy and the Louisiana Public Service Commission to send the letter. I spoke to Chairman Barton's staff, Andy Black, this afternoon and relayed our concerns. The Barton Subcommittee is now expected to mark up an electricity bill in December (per a Republican Member meeting held this morning). ACTION ITEM: Call Rep. Joe Barton (202/225-2002) TALKING POINTS: 1. Should start with something about the Dynegy/Enron transaction (it will be strange if Mr. Lay or Steve calls Chairman Barton and does not start the conversation with some reference to the transaction). 2. Mentioning the transaction naturally leads into the importance of competitive wholesale markets for power, both for consumers and for the largely Texas-based marketing, trading and merchant power industries. 3. We understand that Chairman Barton has been approached by Chairman Tauzin about a letter to FERC on the RTO issue. We know Chairman Barton is well aware of Enron's strong support for FERC's RTO initiatives. We respect Chairman Barton's interest in seeing to it that Congress does not abdicate its responsibility to make energy policy. 4. If, as we have been lead to believe, the letter states or implies that FERC does not have authority to act in the RTO arena, this will be seen as a potentially destabilizing development since FERC is so far down the road of creating RTOs. 5. While we understand some in Congress and elsewhere were concerned that FERC was moving too fast, as of the last FERC meeting earlier this month, that is no longer true even if it ever was true. While we think RTOs should be created sooner rather than later, FERC is listening to state regulators and others who had concerns. 6. A letter from congressional leaders questioning FERC's authority goes too far in the direction of those who oppose any RTOs. Furthermore, it is wrong as a matter of law. The D.C. Circuit held in the gas cases and in the power cases on Order 888 that FERC has authority to address systemic discrimination, which is in large part what the RTOs are all about -- a remedy for iscrimination.",0

"Re:. These are good fixes. I still think it's important for our security people to be able to recognize all of our senior executives and make sure their guests get where they are going quickly. To: Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES cc: Susan Skarness/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Follow-up Steve - Following up on our conversation Friday, we have advised Cliff Baxter's Assistant that effective immediately Cliff and his quests can pass through Security on the Plaza, without showing his access card or requiring his quests to sign in or identify themselves. All he needs to do is approach the front Reception Desks and asking for entry. The receptionists will recognise Cliff by sight and ensure that he and his quests pass through - without delay - by lifting the adjacent rope. We are asking Cliff to use his badge at the card readers, as per standard procedure, when he is entering the building by himself. We are also refining procedures and upgrading our IT systems/data base @ the Reception Desk, to make it easier on a visitor of any employee. For example if you call down to the Plaza Reception Desk and advise that a visitor is expected, the receptionist will have a pass prepared so as to eliminate the sign in process. The guest simply has to exchange their business card for the visitor pass. Or if an employee shows their access card at the Reception Desk and asks that their guest gain entry, that guest can get a badge without signing in. Again, we ask that the guest exchange their business card for a visitor pass. We are working on installing a new data base @ the Desk that will pull up a digitised photo of the employee (duplicate of what's on their badge) on the screen. This will allow employees to get a temporary access badge without showing other ID and will speed process. Finally, we are testing a small proximity access card which is designed to be a duplicate back-up for executives. It is sized to fit on a key chain and works with our standard card readers. - Bill",2

The reasons for that statement, in my opinion, are: * The materials and services that ETS purchase are basic and routine. * Most of those materials and service providers were identified and sourced during 1999 and 2000. * ETS is reaching the point where we need fewer providers, not more. * New items identified are normally rolled into one of our already sourced NPA's. * Almost all large dollar items are bid out (three bids and a buy). * GSS's involvement and commitment to the deal ends with the contract signing. * ETS P&SM organization and our Contracts services group deals with the actual execution and the ringing of the cash register.

Gray Davis by a mid-August deadline. A group of legislators and Davis staffers has worked this week on an agreement that would restore Southern California Edison's credit and relieve the state of having to purchase energy for the utility. Assembly leaders, who convened the group, set an ambitious schedule that would have led to a vote today had they reached consensus and been able to recall enough of the 80 Assembly members from summer recess destinations. But the newly formed plan, which would issue $2.9 billion in consumer-backed bonds in exchange for several Edison concessions, remains too rough for a vote, said Paul Hefner, a spokesman for Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks. Hefner was quick to note that Hertzberg has the Assembly ""on call"" for the scheduled monthlong break and is prepared to ask members to return if a deal comes in the next three weeks. But staff and lawmakers said earlier that organizing a mass return after today would prove nearly impossible because Assembly members are expected to travel throughout the state and beyond. Davis set an Aug. 15 deadline in his original Edison deal and recently said he could call a special session forcing legislators to return if they do not authorize a plan by then. His spokesman, Steven Maviglio, said Thursday the governor is not ruling out that idea but is waiting to see what comes of further legislative discussions. ""It's pretty clear that everyone's working pretty hard to form a consensus, but they're just not there,"" Maviglio said. ""The governor is optimistic about the Aug. 15 date."" Even so, Edison does not expect a solution by then. Company officials stated earlier this week that they would wait for a political deal at least until lawmakers return Aug. 20.

Rose UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER July 27, 2001 Sempra Energy, the parent company of SDG&E, reported a 25 percent surge in profit to $137 million last quarter but said yesterday it lost money on the sale of electricity under a long-term contract to California. On the other hand, Sempra said its largest source of profits was its energy trading unit, a middleman that earned $69 million during the quarter buying and selling energy produced by others. The results underscore the transformation of relatively simple utility companies into diversified energy holding companies that have learned to profit in new ways from the deregulation of electricity and the turmoil in energy markets. The surprising announcement -- that a company lost money selling power during California's run-up in electricity prices -- was explained by Sempra as an intentional consequence of the long-term contract it signed with the state to provide power. Stephen Baum, chairman and chief executive officer of Sempra, said the company agreed to provide a steep discount to California during the summer months but would recoup the losses later in the 10-year deal. California sought long-term electricity purchase contracts so it could reduce its purchases in daily and near-term power markets, where prices reached record levels. Critics say Gov. Gray Davis rushed into long-term deals because of concerns about getting through next year's election. They also say the contracts will saddle customers with higher costs for years. The governor has acknowledged that long-term contracts might cause consumers to pay relatively high prices for electricity in later years, but he maintains it is a fair price to pay for lowering prices that were devastating the state economy. Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, said the steep discount Sempra provided to the state on power this summer raised questions about the governor's proposal to help San Diego Gas & Electric Co. clear a debt of $750 million. SDG&E says it is owed that money for power purchases on behalf of its customers. In a media conference last month, Davis said the agreement would eliminate the threat of a possible balloon payment for consumers, who he said might have faced the so-called balancing account debt as early as next year. Shames says the proposal, which took the form of a memorandum of understanding, or MOU, is costly for consumers and a bonanza for Sempra. He said the relatively cheap power provided by Sempra this summer ""makes the MOU sound like more of a hidden payback to Sempra than a real relief plan for local ratepayers."" Shames said he will release an analysis of the state's Sempra plan next week. The state Public Utilities Commission is expected to rule on the plan in August. A Sempra spokesman said there is no connection between discount power and the tentative agreement to clear the $750 million debt. Doug Kline, the Sempra spokesman, said the power contract with the state was signed in early May and the agreement on the balancing account was reached in mid-June. Sempra Energy Trading, meanwhile, said only 10 percent of its $69 million profit was earned from sales of energy in the western region, which includes California. The trading operation earned $40 million in profit during the comparable period last year. California's Independent System Operator, which manages most of the state power grid, and other investigators have said trading and bidding strategies were tools used by energy companies to raise prices during the California power crisis. Though Sempra earned money on trading, its wholesale power generating business lost $9 million during the quarter. Baum said the discounts on electricity provided the state were the prime cause of the loss for Sempra Energy Resources but added that a plant outage also contributed. Sempra Energy Resources, which co-owns a generating plant near Las Vegas with Reliant Energy, earned $2 million during the second quarter last year. Baum added that Sempra's long-term contract with the state -- under which it will provide up to 1,900 megawatts -- has allowed its wholesale business to pre-sell about half the power it expects to generate from the Nevada plant, which will be expanded, and three generating facilities it expects to build. Profits at SDG&E slipped to $37 million during the quarter ended June 30, down from $40 million last year, according to Sempra. SDG&E, whose business is restricted to delivering gas and electricity, said it provided increased customer service during the crisis, which lowered profits. Wall Street analysts generally applauded Sempra's results, noting that the company was ahead of its plan to generate at least a third of its profits from its newer businesses by 2003. ""They're really two years ahead of schedule for their non-utility businesses,"" said Brian Youngberg, an analyst with Edward Jones & Co. Bud Leedom, a San Diego-based analyst with Wells Fargo Van Kasper, said Sempra's move into energy trading now seems shrewd. ""We never dreamed they were setting themselves for a windfall like this,"" Leedom said. Investors pushed Sempra shares up 17 cents yesterday, to close at $25.49 in trading on The New York Stock Exchange. Bloomberg news service contributed to this report. Smog Rules May Be Eased Power plants: EPA proposes a sweeping change in how utilities' emissions are curbed, a flexible approach favored by the industry. By GARY POLAKOVIC and ELIZABETH SHOGREN Times Staff Writers July 27 2001 WASHINGTON -- U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Christie Whitman proposed sweeping changes Thursday in the regulation of power plant pollution that would replace five of the government's toughest programs with a single, flexible approach favored by utilities. Whitman outlined a plan for cleaning up major components of power plant smog that represents a significant departure from the EPA's traditional regulatory dictums. She called for a major expansion of pollution credit trading, which, up to now, has had varying success. Under the new plan, the EPA would scrap some of the most stringent measures devised by the agency to deal with power plant emissions. One provision to be set aside aims to cut harmful mercury emissions; another is meant to reduce emissions from Midwestern power plants by 85%; another is designed to restore visibility at national parks. Especially unpopular with industry, one measure, known as new source review, requires the installation of advanced pollution controls whenever power plants are expanded or modified. It too would be phased out. ""New source review is certainly one of those regulatory aspects that would no longer be necessary,"" Whitman told Sen. George Voinovich (R-Ohio) at the hearing by the Environment and Public Works Committee. ""All of those [programs] could be aligned into one regulatory process"" that she said would work better than existing rules. Whitman's comments offer the first peek into the administration's plans for cleaning some of the dirtiest polluters left in the nation. Debate over the administration's clean-air approach has shifted to Congress as it considers whether to revise the national Clean Air Act. The magnitude of the proposed revisions caught environmentalists by surprise but buoyed industry representatives who say existing controls are costly and inefficient. ""She has raised an appalling prospect of junking virtually every rule and strategy to deal with emissions of electric companies in return for some vague industry-sought plan for an emissions trading scheme,"" said Frank O'Donnell, executive director of the Clean Air Trust, an environmental advocacy group. ""If they go forward with this, it means a wholesale fight over the Clean Air Act in Congress."" After the hearing, Whitman stressed that the overall goal is to clean the air more efficiently than current rules do. Although the administration has not yet released a so-called multipollutant cleanup strategy, Whitman contended that collapsing several regulations into one far-reaching approach would be easier for regulators and industry to manage. ""What we're looking for is targets under this legislation that significantly clean up the air beyond what our current regulatory, statutory requirements would do,"" Whitman said. She added that new source review, for example, ""could potentially be no longer necessary if you have the right kind of targets set in a multi-emissions bill. We have to wait and see where the targets are set."" Utilities have lobbied Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force to prevent the EPA from aggressively enforcing the new source review regulation. Industry and administration officials say the provision is onerous and prevents plant upgrades, although EPA officials say it is a key tool for forcing dirty, old plants to cut emissions by up to 95%. During the Clinton administration, federal officials charged that 32 coal-fired power plants in several Southern and Midwestern states ignored a requirement that companies install advanced emission controls when their plants were upgraded. The government reached settlement with three utilities, but a provision in the Bush administration's energy plan stalled those enforcement actions pending a review of power plant controls. C. Boyden Gray, attorney for the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council and former White House counsel for the first President Bush in the 1980s, praised the administration's proposal. He said major utility companies he represents, including Southern Co., Duke Energy Co. and the Tennessee Valley Authority, could clean up with greater flexibility and less cost under the plan outlined by Whitman. ""To put everything in a market-incentives basis is a great step. It would be a real breakthrough and a plus for the business community,"" Gray said. For example, Gray said EPA has four separate measures to control nitrogen oxides from power plant combustion, including programs to cut acid rain, ozone and haze. Another program scheduled to take effect in May 2004 requires power plants in 19 states to cut summer emissions by 1 million tons annually. He said those programs can be confusing and costly and could easily be replaced by a credit-trading program run largely by power companies. Under the program being considered by the Bush administration, an emission limit could be established at hundreds of power plants followed by annual reductions in mercury, a toxic metal, as well as smog-forming nitrogen and sulfur oxides. However, a provision to reduce carbon dioxide, a gas implicated in global warming, was dropped under industry pressure. Power companies that reduce beyond their limits could sell emission credits, which represent a pound of pollution, to companies that exceed their limits. Although industry and free-market advocates favor such programs, they are not without controversy. The record of market-driven programs is mixed. On the one hand, the nation's acid rain program uses marketable permits and is widely credited with cutting sulfur oxides at less cost. On the other hand, the world's first market-driven program to tackle urban smog has not worked in Los Angeles, where nearly 400 power companies and manufacturers failed to achieve significant cleanup for the nearly eight years the program has been in effect. Further, many environmental groups are wary of market-driven programs because by design they preclude active government intervention. Critics say such programs could potentially limit public review of power plant operations, allow emissions to concentrate in poor communities and slow efforts to cut haze in national parks downwind from plants that elect to buy pollution credits instead of cleaning up. The Bush administration's power plant strategy was aired before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which is chaired by Sen. James M. Jeffords (I-Vt.), whose dramatic departure from the GOP threw control of the Senate to the Democrats. Jeffords is proposing legislation, different from the administration's approach, that would control four power plant pollutants, including the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, an approach rejected by the Bush administration. Prospects appear to be increasing that Congress will pass one or more measures designed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, a belated response to this week's decision by more than 180 countries to deal with the problem without the involvement of the United States. Indeed, in recent weeks several members in the GOP-led House and Democratic Senate have voted on bills with the intention of disassociating themselves from President Bush's environmental policies before the next election. Among the votes, the House struck down a provision supported by the Bush administration that could hinder progress on global climate change policy. The Senate banned new coal mining and oil and gas drilling in national monuments. Other recent rebuffs included rejections of administration initiatives on such issues as the Endangered Species Act, hard-rock mining regulations and offshore drilling for oil and gas. Copyright 2001, Los Angeles Times <http://www.latimes.com> Federal Caps Didn't Deter Higher Prices Power: Cal-ISO study says suppliers continued to charge as much as five times more than the imposed limits. By NANCY VOGEL TIMES STAFF WRITER July 27 2001 SACRAMENTO -- After federal regulators limited wholesale electricity prices last month, big private sellers of power in California continued to ask as much as five times more for electricity than the federal cap, according to a confidential study by state grid operators. The analysis by the California Independent System Operator covers only the first week after the caps were imposed June 20. Cal-ISO has submitted the data to federal regulators for potential investigation. The report is a summary of what Cal-ISO calls possible anti-competitive behavior by Duke Energy, Williams Cos., Mirant Corp., Reliant Energy and Dynegy Corp. ""In a truly competitive market we would expect these suppliers to bid very close to their actual operating cost,"" said Greg Cook, senior policy analyst with Cal-ISO's Department of Market Analysis. The state did not necessarily purchase any power at the high prices being demanded. Instead, the significance of the bids is that they show how California could find itself paying exorbitant prices for electricity again if hot weather returns and conservation slackens, said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who studies the California electricity market. ""The bottom line is that the generators are putting out these bids in expectation of high demand,"" he said. ""If weather all of a sudden gets really hot from Southern to Northern California, the bids submitted by generators could be very costly to California."" Cal-ISO calculated the cost of production for each company based on the efficiency of its power plants and estimates of what each paid for natural gas to fuel the plants. The average cost for the five was $105 per megawatt-hour, which closely matches the federal price limit in California, which now stands at $101 per megawatt-hour. According to the power bidding procedures, companies that bid at or below their cost of production often still get paid a higher price, allowing them to make a substantial profit. On average, four of the five companies submitted bids either slightly below or slightly above their cost of production. But with the exception of Atlanta-based Mirant, each company at times submitted bids that were substantially higher. Houston-based Reliant, for example, bid as much as $540 per megawatt-hour, more than five times its estimated cost. Overall, Reliant's average bid was close to costs, according to the analysis. Cal-ISO identified companies by code in its report. Sources familiar with the study identified the companies for The Times. The Cal-ISO report singled out ""Supplier 5,"" identified by sources as Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Energy, saying the company ""continues to bid significantly in excess of its operating costs."" Duke owns two large power plants on the central coast. It marked up its bids an average of 88% beyond its cost to produce electricity, according to the analysis. For example, it cost Duke $85 to $121 to generate a megawatt-hour of electricity in the time period studied, the report shows, but the company offered to sell a megawatt-hour from $149 to $195. Duke spokesman Tom Williams on Thursday said, ""The use of the data in some cases doesn't appear to add up and in all cases appears to be selective and could easily be misunderstood."" Duke sells nearly the entire output of its power plants under long-term contracts, and not on the spot market, which the Cal-ISO report studied, he noted. Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley said, ""We're looking at the data, and we question whether or not it is correct."" A combination of cool weather, heavy conservation, the start-up of new power plants and recently signed long-term power contracts that guarantee supplies have eased the state's electricity crisis in recent weeks. Market prices that as recently as May averaged $271 per megawatt-hour have dropped to less than $100 per megawatt-hour. The more abundant power supplies have freed grid operators to ignore higher-priced bids. But they will have to consider paying such prices to avoid blackouts if supplies tighten, Wolak said. Such a scenario would test the effectiveness of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission order issued June 19, he said. The bids of the five companies analyzed were offers of sales to Cal-ISO, a Folsom-based agency that manages the electrical transmission grid serving 75% of California. Cal-ISO buys power on short notice to smooth the flow on the state's electrical freeway and avert blackouts. As California's fledgling market began to go haywire last fall, Cal-ISO workers struggled to purchase as much as 30% of the state's power demand with just hours to spare. Since then, the market has stabilized, and Cal-ISO's purchases now amount to roughly 5% of the electricity California consumes. RELATED STORY Power profits: Power plant operator Calpine said its quarterly profit more than doubled. C2 Copyright 2001, Los Angeles Times <http://www.latimes.com> Calpine profits double on skyrocketing sales Escalating power prices inspire plant building program Carolyn Said, Chronicle Staff Writer <mailto:csaid@sfchronicle.com> Friday, July 27, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle </chronicle/info/copyright> URL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/07/27/ BU234287.DTL> Fueled by high electricity prices, power generator Calpine Corp. reported strong second-quarter results yesterday. Calpine of San Jose said profit for the quarter ended June 30 almost doubled to $107.7 million (32 cents per share) from $59.5 million (20 cents) during the year-ago quarter. Revenue almost quadrupled to $1.61 billion from $417.2 million a year ago. Excluding charges related to the acquisition of Canada's Encal Energy, Calpine's net income was $132.2 million (39 cents), well above the 31 cents per share predicted by analysts, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. Calpine is on an ambitious path to expand its roster of generating plants. By the end of 2005, it expects to have 75,000 megawatts in operation in the United States, including 12,000 megawatts in California. A megawatt is about enough power for 1,000 homes. The company, which generates 2,428 megawatts in California, this summer opened the state's first two major power plants in a decade. The new plants in Yuba City (Sutter County) and Pittsburg generate 547 and 555 megawatts, respectively. Combined with a new plant in Arizona that sells power to California, Calpine's new facilities helped the state stave off threatened blackouts this summer, Chief Executive Officer Peter Cartwright said. Calpine is building the 847-megawatt Delta Energy Center in Pittsburg, scheduled to open in May, and a 750-megawatt plant in Kern County, due in June 2003. It is also awaiting an August decision by the California Energy Commission on its proposed 600-megawatt Metcalf Energy Center in San Jose. ""California is a very good market for us,"" said Bill Highlander, a Calpine spokesman. ""The pricing in California has benefited Calpine."" However, he said, the company was not one of the traders that focused on making top dollar in California's volatile spot market, because its business model concentrated on selling electricity through long-term contracts. During the past few months, Calpine signed 10-year and 20-year contracts with the state for as much as 2,500 megawatts, at prices ranging from $58.60 to $73 per megawatt hour. With most of its plants fired by natural gas, Calpine wants to control about a quarter of the gas it uses, Highlander said. Its April purchase of Encal Energy for $1.77 billion more than doubled its gas reserves, to about 1. 7 trillion cubic feet equivalent, according to Hoover's Online. Calpine's stock closed up $1.08 at $36.89 yesterday.

In one case, an energy company charged as much as five times more for electricity than the federal cap, which were imposed June 20. State grid operators have given the study to federal regulators for a possible investigation, the Los Angeles Times reported Friday. Five companies were identified by code in the report and sources familiar with the study named the wholesalers for the Times. They include Duke Energy, Dynegy Corp., Mirant Corp., Reliant Corp., and Williams Cos. The average price charged by the five power companies was $105 per megawatt-hour, which closely matches the federal price limit in California set at $101 per megawatt-hour. Four of the five companies submitted bids either just below or just above their cost of production. Houston-based Reliant, however, asked as much as $540 per megawatt-hour in some cases. Overall, the company's average bid was close to costs, the report said. The state wasn't required to purchase power at the rates set by wholesalers but the bids reflect a potential repeat of charging exorbitant electricity prices if temperatures soar and conservation dwindles, said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who studies the California electricity market. ""The bottom line is that the generators are putting out these bids in expectation of high demand,"" he said. ""If weather all of a sudden gets really hot from Southern to Northern California, the bids submitted by generators could be very costly to California."" The Cal-ISO report singled out Duke Energy, noting it ""continues to bid significantly in excess of its operating costs."" The report shows the company's cost to produce electricity was between $85 and $121 but it offered to sell a megawatt-hour from $149 to $195. Cal-ISO calculated the cost of production for each company based on the efficiency of its power plants and estimates what each paid for natural gas to fuel the plants. ""The use of the data in some cases doesn't appear to add up and in all cases appears to be selective and could easily be misunderstood,"" said Duke spokesman Tom Williams. ,2001 Associated Press THE ENERGY CRUNCH Environmental suit against power plant Expansion called danger to slough Christian Berthelsen, Scott Winokur, Chronicle Staff Writers <mailto:cberthelsen@sfchronicle.com> Friday, July 27, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle </chronicle/info/copyright> URL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/07/27/ MN236840.DTL> An environmental group filed suit yesterday to overturn a permit granted to Duke Energy Co. to expand a major power plant south of Santa Cruz. Saying the permit was illegally awarded, the suit warns that the resulting project will damage the ecologically important Elkorn Slough. Voices of the Wetlands accuses the board that awarded the permit of violating federal law by not requiring Duke to use the best possible technology to minimize impacts on the environment around the Moss Landing power plant. If plans to expand the plant proceed without change, the group said, it would kill off critical organisms at the bottom of the food chain. The suit, filed in Monterey County against the California State Water Resources Control Board and the regional board that serves the central coast, seeks a court order to return the case to the regional water district so that more environmentally sensitive cooling technology can be ordered for use at the plant. State officials said yesterday that the issues raised in the suit were considered and rejected during the initial permit approval process last year, and again during the appeal process this year. The case comes amid enormous pressure on state officials, in light of California's energy crisis, to rapidly accelerate power plant approvals and expand the amount of power generation available. Against this backdrop, the state water board on June 21 essentially rejected environmental groups' appeal that had sought to overturn the district board's decision approving the Moss Landing expansion permit. On another front, board members of the California Energy Commission took testimony earlier this week on a proposal to curtail public review of plant project proposals, with one board member, Robert A. Laurie, acknowledging in an interview that he believed ""in some cases"" it posed one of the most time- consuming aspects of project approval. A recommendation is expected within the next month. Duke, of Charlotte, N.C., bought the Moss Landing plant from Pacific Gas & Electric Co. in 1998, when the Northern California utility sold off many of its facilities to prepare for deregulation of the energy market. The plant was built in 1950 using a cooling system technology that sucks water out of the Elkorn Slough and Monterey Bay to cool generating turbines before spitting the water out into the Pacific Ocean. The group says wildlife conditions and sea otter population have improved markedly since PG&E mothballed many of the generating units at Moss Landing in 1995. But Duke now is proposing to resurrect parts of the cooling system in a major expansion that will make Moss Landing the state's largest power plant after its completion next summer. With an output of 2,538 megawatts, the plant when completed is expected to account for 30 percent of all new electricity generated in California next year, serving about 2.5 million households in the Monterey, Santa Cruz and southern Santa Clara County areas, including San Jose. Regional water quality board officials declined comment yesterday, citing the pending litigation. But in public documents filed yesterday, water officials said cooling alternatives had been considered and rejected. The documents did not elaborate on why they were not mandated. Duke had acknowledged during the process that more ecologically sensitive technologies were available, but at prohibitive costs of $20 million to $50 million more. Deborah Sivas, an attorney for the Earthjustice Environmental Law Clinic, which filed the suit on behalf of Voices of the Wetlands, considered the best technology alternatives mandatory, not optional. She said the board had not considered alternative approaches in reaching its conclusions.

Take the Edison bail out as evidence. At its essence, the deal works like this: Taxpayers give the utility a big pile of cash; the state gets some old, rickety transmission lines in return. Don't be fooled: The power bounty is basically a political ploy. The state doesn't need to control electric distribution. What politicos need is a face-saving trade as evidence that this is a business deal - not a government handout. The state probably should just write the check and eat its losses. But if bureaucrats wanted real remuneration from this bail out, California would eye some juicy Edison assets. As a public service, I'll list a few. Now, for argument's sake, I won't differentiate between the utility and its parent company, Edison International. Hey, lawyers built those walls between the two. Let 'em figure out how to take 'em down. For starters, you'd figure an energy-strapped state would like some regional power plants, no? Like the San Onofre facility. However, it might be laughable to see Sacramento-types defending their future handling of the local nuclear plant. OK, if that's a tad too dicey for the state, how about a coal-fired plant in Nevada? Heck, Edison had a buyer at half a billion bucks before the state oddly quashed that deal. Maybe the state could grab it from Edison -- then flip it to pay off electricity-related debts. Of course, buying one of the out-of-town power plants that Edison's sister company in Irvine has acquired might be educational for Sacramento. Owning a plant in Illinois or Pennsylvania or possibly New Zealand might show state honchos how easy - or not - it is to rig supply and prices. Alternatively, the state could demand a small entity called Edison Capital. Basically, it's a bank. One specialty: the politically correct field of affordable-housing lending. A good fit for bureaucrats. Speaking of money, there's the Edison pension plan. Governments are really good at running retirement benefits. Heck, California already has a huge one. There's got to be some economies of scale - real cash savings - in merging the Edison plan with some state pension fund. Do note that Edison's plan might be overfunded by about $400 million. You can bet, though, that the state would never have the nerve to play 1980s corporate raider: profiting by grabbing some of a company's overfunded retirement kitty. Finally, there's Edison International Field in Anaheim. Stadium naming-rights contracts must have some value since corporations always seem to fight over these promotional gimmicks. (The utility's parent company paid $50 million in 1997 for two decades of ""free"" publicity.) Imagine the buzz the state could get out of the huge sign age on a nationally renowned stadium. Plus, maybe the Angels could be good corporate citizens and tie into this deal. It's possible they'd allow a slight change in the team name to better emphasize the state's role in the ballpark. So, how does ""California Angels"" sound to you? Business; Financial Desk California Sempra Continues Improved Results NANCY RIVERA BROOKS 07/27/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page C-2 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company Sempra Energy on Thursday reported another quarter of higher earnings and revenue, a sharp contrast to California 's bigger and beleaguered investor-owned utilities. Although California 's electricity crisis has pushed Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electricity into insolvency--and PG&E into U.S. Bankruptcy Court--the parent of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas continues to post improved results on the strength of its non-utility businesses. Net income for the period ended June 30 rose 25% to $137 million, or 66 cents a share, up $25 million, or 55 cents, earned a year ago, the San Diego-based utility holding company said. Revenue jumped 40% to $2.1 billion. Pretax operating income rose 24% to $291 million. Sempra's earnings came in just ahead of the 65-cent average estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. ""Our strong second-quarter performance is primarily the result of our efforts to accelerate growth through new businesses,"" Stephen L. Baum, Sempra's chairman, chief executive and president, told analysts in a conference call. Sempra is in a vastly different position than Edison International and PG&E Corp. because its electric utility arm was able to avoid the deep financial woes afflicting their respective Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric utilities. SDG&E was first to sell its power plants two years ago and thus was freed from a rate freeze. That in turn allowed the utility to pass along to customers the soaring costs of electricity beginning last summer. The state Legislature eventually rolled back and capped the rates for SDG&E customers, but promised the utility it would be allowed to recover those losses. Edison and PG&E, however, continued to accumulate staggering debts because their retail rate freezes remained in place. In contrast, Sempra is solvent, with $1.5 billion in cash and $1 billion in available credit, Baum said. The performance of its utilities was lackluster, with Southern California Gas earning $47 million, unchanged from the second quarter of 2000, and SDG&E earning $37 million, down from $40 million in the year-ago period. But Sempra's unregulated businesses--including energy trading, power plant construction and operation, international electricity operations and energy services--turned in an overall strong performance, contributing 39% of the parent company's earnings. Sempra's trading unit provided most of that profit, contributing $69 million to second-quarter net income compared with $40 million in the same quarter last year. Sempra's stock gained 17 cents to close at $25.49 on the New York Stock Exchange. Business; Financial Desk California Calpine Doubles Earnings, Beats Forecasts Energy: San Jose-based company credits higher electricity prices in California and sales from new plants. 07/27/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page C-2 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company Calpine Corp., one of the biggest U.S. power-plant builders, said Thursday that second-quarter earnings more than doubled, beating estimates, because of higher electricity prices in California and sales from new plants. Profit from operations rose to $132.2 million, or 39 cents a share, from net income of $59.5 million, or 20 cents, a year earlier. Revenue almost quadrupled to $1.61 billion. San Jose-based Calpine opened plants in the U.S. with a combined capacity of 1,545 megawatts--enough to light 1.5 million average homes--and benefited from existing plants in California . Calpine has insulated itself from rising fuel costs by buying natural-gas fields to supply its plants. ""Given the strategy they have chosen, they're following through quite well,"" said Andre Meade, an analyst at Commerzbank Capital Markets Co. ""They are growing from a small base and adding a lot of plants, so we'd expect high growth."" Profit topped the 31-cent average estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. Calpine said it expects to earn $2 a share this year. The average First Call forecast was $1.92, with a range of $1.80 to $2.04. Calpine's shares rose $1.08, or 3%, to close at $36.89 on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares had fallen 21% this year amid concern that generators might have to give back some of the profit they made selling power in California during the last year. In addition, cooler-than-normal weather and conservation efforts recently reduced power prices in the state. Calpine runs or is building natural gas plants in 29 U.S. states and Canada that produce more than 30,000 megawatts of power. The company plans to more than double capacity to 70,000 megawatts by the end of 2005. Calpine this month opened the $350-million Sutter plant, California 's first major generator in more than a decade. The company is building 11 plants to run during times of peak demand in the state and getting permits for four more, James Macias, who oversees Calpine's West Coast power plants, said in a conference call with analysts and investors. Separately, Arlington, Va.-based AES Corp., a power producer that supplies California and operates in 27 countries, said second-quarter profit fell 20% because of losses tied to currency fluctuations and the sale of a U.S. electricity retailer. Net income fell to $112 million, or 21 cents a share, from $140 million, or 28 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 26% to $2.21 billion. California ; Metro Desk Cap No Bar to Higher Prices Power: Cal-ISO study says suppliers continued to charge as much as five times more than the U.S.-imposed limits. NANCY VOGEL 07/27/2001 Los Angeles Times Ventura County Edition Page B-1 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO -- After federal regulators limited wholesale electricity prices last month, big private sellers of power in California continued to ask as much as five times more for electricity than the federal cap, according to a confidential study by state grid operators. The analysis by the California Independent System Operator covers only the first week after the caps were imposed June 20. Cal-ISO has submitted the data to federal regulators for potential investigation. The report is a summary of what Cal-ISO calls possible anti-competitive behavior by Duke Energy, Williams Cos., Mirant Corp., Reliant Energy and Dynegy Corp. ""In a truly competitive market we would expect these suppliers to bid very close to their actual operating cost,"" said Greg Cook, senior policy analyst with Cal-ISO's Department of Market Analysis. The state did not necessarily purchase any power at the high prices being demanded. Instead, the significance of the bids is that they show how California could find itself paying exorbitant prices for electricity again if hot weather returns and conservation slackens, said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who studies the California electricity market. ""The bottom line is that the generators are putting out these bids in expectation of high demand,"" he said. ""If weather all of a sudden gets really hot from Southern to Northern California , the bids submitted by generators could be very costly to California ."" Cal-ISO calculated the cost of production for each company based on the efficiency of its power plants and estimates of what each paid for natural gas to fuel the plants. The average cost for the five was $105 per megawatt-hour, which closely matches the federal price limit in California , which now stands at $101 per megawatt-hour. According to the power bidding procedures, companies that bid at or below their cost of production often still get paid a higher price, allowing them to make a substantial profit. On average, four of the five companies submitted bids either slightly below or slightly above their cost of production. But with the exception of Atlanta-based Mirant, each company at times submitted bids that were substantially higher. Houston-based Reliant, for example, bid as much as $540 per megawatt-hour, more than five times its estimated cost. Overall, Reliant's average bid was close to costs, according to the analysis. Cal-ISO identified companies by code in its report. Sources familiar with the study identified the companies for The Times. The Cal-ISO report singled out ""Supplier 5,"" identified by sources as Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Energy, saying the company ""continues to bid significantly in excess of its operating costs."" Duke owns two large power plants on the central coast. It marked up its bids an average of 88% beyond its cost to produce electricity , according to the analysis. For example, it cost Duke $85 to $121 to generate a megawatt-hour of electricity in the time period studied, the report shows, but the company's bids ranged from $149 to $195 per megawatt-hour. Duke spokesman Tom Williams on Thursday said, ""The use of the data in some cases doesn't appear to add up and in all cases appears to be selective and could easily be misunderstood."" Duke sells nearly the entire output of its power plants under long-term contracts, and not on the spot market, which the Cal-ISO report studied, he noted. Calpine Net Soars On Added Plants; Sempra Profit Rises By Rebecca Smith 07/27/2001 The Wall Street Journal Page B4 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) Calpine Corp. reported net income nearly doubled in the second quarter, reflecting the independent power producer's aggressive plant-building program. Meanwhile, the parent of a San Diego utility said profit rose 25%. Calpine, of San Jose, Calif., said net was $107.7 million, or 32 cents a share, up from $59.5 million, or 20 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest results, which were in line with analysts' expectations, included a special charge of seven cents a share related to Calpine's purchase of Encal Energy Ltd., a natural-gas company. Revenue grew even more strongly, soaring to $1.61 billion from $417.2 million. Separately, Sempra Energy, parent of electric utility San Diego Gas & Electric, reported profit rose to $137 million from $110 million a year earlier. Revenue jumped 40% to $2.1 billion from $1.5 billion. Sempra Chairman Steve Baum attributed the growth, which stands in marked contrast to the financial woes of California 's other electric-utility-owning energy companies, to Sempra's unregulated operations. Calpine's profit increased despite paying substantially more for natural gas to fuel its plants. It spent an average of $4.80 per million British Thermal Units for natural gas, up from $3.31 a year before. At the same time, Calpine's revenue per megawatt hour of electricity sold also rose, to $71.03 in the latest period from $64.80 a year earlier. At Sempra, Mr. Baum said profit from Sempra's biggest utility unit, San Diego Gas & Electric, fell 7.5% to $37 million from $40 million. Results were flat at its gas-distribution company, Southern California Gas Co. Sempra Energy Trading was the big profit center, generating half its total profit, or $69 million, compared with $40 million a year earlier. Mr. Baum said Sempra's stock, which trades at a low price/earnings multiple of 10, still is being ""affected negatively by the California situation."" He also said the company made less money in spot-power markets than in prior quarters but nevertheless intends to invest $2 billion in new power plants. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Calpine shares rose $1.08 to $36.89, while Sempra climbed 17 cents to $25.49.",0
