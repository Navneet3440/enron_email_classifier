Since Enron and EBS are trying to cut costs and be more cost effective, why 
would a vice president need an executive computer setup at home?  Especially 
if they already have a laptop (provided by Enron)  they take home every night 
and have taken advantage of the Click at Home program as well.  Since Enron 
has gone through the expense of giving each and every employee the 
opportunity of the Click at Home program, it seems to be a somewhat redundant 
expense of which I might add is unnecessary in my opinion.

I feel it would behoove ALL EMPLOYEES, including executives, to be more 
conscientious of costs and expenses to improve Enron's and EBS' bottom-line.  
How can we (""Enron"") be a world leading company if we don't have leading 
world leaders that spend Enron's money as if it were there own.

I think it would be in Enron's best interest to set some guidelines regarding 
expenses such as these.  Just because a person is an executive of the company 
why should be allowed to have anything they want just because they can?

Thank you for your time and the opportunity to express myself.  Especially 
since I am a shareholder also and care where the money goes.

Steve,

Thank you for participating, once again, in the video for deal central. The 
videos are created, housed and maintained in Beth Tilney's area.
I mentioned to Beth that Corporate may have an interest in sharing/utilizing 
the EES video equipment and expertise. Robert Pearson (our in-house film 
expert) has a masters in video programming, taping, etc. And the good 
news....within the next few weeks, the editing equipment will be fully up and 
running.
Once installed and operational, all in-house produced videos will have the 
look and feel of those created by outside vendors.

Please feel free to contact Beth (ext. 3.5022) if you have an interest in 
exploring this concept.

And thank you again for your participation.

Best-Kim ",thank you,1,"Company Business, Strategy, etc."

Subject: RE: Draft of Market rate filing


          Marcus: Here are the others points I wanted to make, just briefly:

                1.  I still think I need to talk to FERC staff before we file.
     Here's why:  
                    - - FERC, as you know, is about to issue a new rule 
                       on market-based rate eligibility.
                    - - In the meantime, they've been kicking out a very 
                      high percentage of MBR applicants for trumped up
                    reasons.  I.e., issuing deficiency letters on issues we 
                    know they don't care about.  I think the real reason 
                    is they don't want to issue a lot of approvals until the 
                    new rule comes out.
                      - -  No matter how perfect our filing is, we're liable
                     to get kicked out, too.  They might not want to give
                     MBR to a new Enron entity until they see the new
                     rule.
                     - -    The best way to deal with that is to sit down with 
                     staff, go over the draft page by page, and see
                     what more they want.  But that would take too long,
                     because of staff's schedule.
                     - -   The second best way is for me to call Dan 
                    Larcamp or Mike Coleman, at FERC; tell them that 
                    we're not in a huge hurry, but we really don't want a
                    deficiency letter; read him the language in the draft
                    about how we'll comply with the new rule, and see if 
                    that's good enough.  If he suggests different 
                    language, we'll have to put it in there.
                     - - Alternatively, if we really want to try to slide this 
                    through without saying anything to FERC in 
                    advance, we can file it, and just hope that the 
                    language we have about complying with the new 
                    rule  is good enough.   But that's really not what I 
                    would recommend. 

         If we do decide to call FERC, I could call right away, and probably get an answer in time to file today.  If not, then certainly tomorrow. Otherwise, we're pretty much ready. 

             2.  I really do think that we could ask for 30 days without raising any eyebrows. 

                                  Good luck, and I'll talk to you soon.

Attached is a mark up of suggested changes to the filing as per my
voicemail earlier this morning.
In addition we will need to confirm whether Sandhills is a subsidiary of
Enron Corp.
We will be adding two contacts from our Regulatory Group.

Marcus,

  The attached revised draft ""fixes"" the ESVL/EVSL error.  Also, we
tried to catch the reference to ENA.  We will work on that further
tomorrow.  I wanted to send this draft to you now, however, so that you
could review it without constantly being distracted by seeing EVSL
throughout the document.  I know that would distract me.  I hope this
helps.

ESVL Corp will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. not Enron
North America Corp. In addition I see that some of the letters have
become transposed and ESVL often reads EVSL.
	
With ESVL Corp being a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. there may
well be other changes that need to be made.
	
Will speak tomorrow.

Marcus

The draft filing is attached.  We are working on adding headers to the
rate schedule and code of conduct.  

Thank you for the information on New Albany.  I removed all references
to New Albany because we recently worked with Susan, Stuart and Robert
on that transaction.  Also we removed the references to five other
peakers Enron sold recently - we worked with Stuart to get those FERC
approvals.  In addition, we did not include a reference to North
Carolina Power Holdings, L.L.C. made in earlier filings.  We are aware
that Enron received 203 authorization to sell that entity earlier this
year.  We am uncertain about whether that transaction closed but we
assumed it did and removed it but need to confirm with you that it is
appropriate to remove it.  

Thank you for the suggestion about updating the information from the
triennial filing.  We will certainly double check to make sure the
companies we have listed in the attached draft have not been sold.
Also, we refer to exhibit 2 to the triennial filing made on January 14,
2000 rather than listing the names of Enron's generating units with
market-based rate authorization whose output is dedicated under
long-term contracts.  We will confirm that this information is still
accurate as well.  

Thanks again,

Cathy

In addition to Sandhills Enron also made a 203 filing this year in
respect of the sale of the New Albany plant to Duke. You will probably
need to run a check on Enron at FERC to ensure that between us we have
identified any changes to the three year update for EPMI which was
prepared at the beginning of this year.

We're in the process of developing a strategy to take us through the next few 
months.  But while the (otherwise perishable) thoughts are still fresh in my 
mind from the hearings on Monday and Tuesday, I wanted to throw out some 
observations for discussion in the days/weeks ahead.

OBSERVATION--The pressure to finger somebody for ""price gouging"" is 
increasing.

The administration is hell bent on finding a ""fall guy.""  The price spikes 
pose real political risks for Davis and he and his folks need and want an 
easy way out.   His press release following the hearing renewed the call for 
""refunds.""  On my panel, Loretta Lynch asked Reliant and Duke to supply her 
with the details of the contracts they cut to sell their power forward to 
marketers.  And Carl Wood's remarks were extreme.
At the Barton hearing, a liberal democrat (Filner) and a conservative 
Republican (Hunter) locked arms in calling for refunds. Bilbray joined the 
""gouging"" band wagon.
The utilities repeatedly called on FERC to do a ""real"" investigation, with 
hearings, testimony, data discovery---the works. 
On the positive side, the FERC commissioners lauded Wolak, his analysis, and 
his remarks on the panel.  Wolak said somewhat emphatically that the nature 
of California's market structure makes it impossible to single out a single 
participant as the culprit.  He also stated that just everyone's just acting 
in their own self-interest, responding to the screwed incentives embedded in 
the structure.

IMPLICATION--It seems prudent for Enron to understand better its risks of 
getting fingered.

In the best case, the clamoring for a ""refund"" subsides.  In which case, the 
only cost to Enron is the internal cost incurred to understand better the 
risks of getting fingered.
In the medium case, investigations find that Enron (like others) ""played by 
the rules,"" but the rules stunk, and Enron profited at the expense of 
California consumers.  ","Observations on the Hearings this Week. We're in the process of developing a strategy to take us through the next few months.

Matt:

As GSS Business Development transitions the HP relationship for broadband to 
your team, there are several issues I wanted to clarify in terms of how the 
relationship has been developed and who the contacts have been to date.  
Additionally, I outlined the discussion points/action items from this 
morning's meeting you held with Jennifer Medcalf and myself.  Per your 
request, the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP's business 
partners was e-mailed to you this morning.

HP contacts to date: 

Bill Lovejoy, Western Gulf Area Sales Manager
Houston, TX
#(713)-439-5587
(Gerry Cashiola's boss)

Gerry Cashiola, sales representative 
Houston, TX
#(713)-439-5555
(To date, HP person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play)

Greg Pyle, Solution Control Manager
Southeast Region
Austin, TX 
(#(512)-257-5735
(Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer 
leadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola)

Daniel Morgridge, Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliances
Austin, TX
#(512)-257-5736
(Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances)

Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect, e-Services Solutions
Cupertino, CA
#(408)-447-5240
(To date, clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP's business 
propositions; strong technical, financial background to craft value 
propositions.  Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the 
11/16th meeting)

Matt,
 
On November 10th, GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron's 
trading floor, the gas control center, and the peaking power plant unit 
center on the trading floor.  This tour was one meeting, amongst several, 
held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron's 
products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron 
(EBS, GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel).

On November 16th GSS Business Development,  Patrick Tucker, and Dale Clark 
outlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas  --  connectivity, storage, and 
wireless.  Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting:

1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date, Gerry Cashiola 
has stalled on providing this).  Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this 
information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short 
term opportunity.  What is HP's time horizon for short term?

2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to 
explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8)

3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel, GSS IT 
Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14)   

In conversations with you, Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning, several 
decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed:


Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process.  More 
importantly, despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews 
of Enron's products and services; met with Peter Goebel and his team on the 
GSS buy side, and participated in an Experience Enron tour, Gerry has been 
unable to define an HP business proposition.  The coordination between 
Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term, 12-24 months) has 
remained unorganized.  These initiatives need to be developed separately.


Clearly,  the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior 
level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship 
forward at a strategic level.  As the relationship is developed at this 
strategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way.  But 
Gerry's short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship, 
rather a by-product.  To facilitate this process of elevating the 
relationship, Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and 
Greg Pyle.  Lovejoy's boss is Dan Sytsma, VP of  HP's America's Central 
Region.

 In the conference call Thursday, 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding 
wireless initiatives, Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS 
initiative by reiterating the following two points:  

 a) Enron is already an HP customer; the onus is on HP  to move forward on 
the process of building a strategic  relationship  (IBM and Lexmark are only 
some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running)

 b) HP's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP's 
business relationship process with Enron

 Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill 
Dwyer, Chief Architect e-Services Solutions, (met at the meeting 11/16) in 
the near term.  Perhaps, plan a visit to Cupertino, California to see Dwyer 
in person.  


We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and 
other opportunities.

Steve

Thanks for stepping in and backing up for Joe Sutton on Wednesday.  I wanted 
to provide you with talking points for your speaking engagement with our new 
hire analysts during their orientation.  As a reminder, you are scheduled to 
speak over lunch on Monday, July 17 from 12:00 p.m. to 12:30 p.m. at the 
Doubletree Hotel in the LaSalle Ballroom.

Purpose of the luncheon:  Welcome the new hire analysts and impart to them 
our important this program is to Enron.

The analyst program is the ultimate pipeline of top entry-level talent, 
strategically deployed to meet anticipated business needs.  We look to this 
program to provide the company with our future business leader.
The program is a premier partner in providing exciting career challenges in 
areas of Finance, Origination/Structuring, Technology, Risk Management, Sales 
and Marketing, Trading, Valuation, and Accounting. 
The analyst program is also an avenue for providing the solid foundation of 
knowledge and skill needed in a competitive and dynamic global corporation.
We are very excited to have you on our team.  This is a very exciting company 
that is always reinventing itself.  The opportunities are endless.


There will be 75 new hire analysts attending this orientation.  Other than 
the recruiting process, this is their first impression of Enron and Senior 
Management.  The first week of their orientation will consist of 
presentations given by all business units/operating companies.  Weeks two and 
three will consist of technical training (i.e., modeling, valuation, working 
styles, communicating effectively and computer training).  Additionally, we 
have social events scheduled to allow them to network with peers and 
management.  Additionally, I have attached a calendar of the orientation for 
your review.

Steve, let me know if you require additional information.  Thank you for your 
support in our new hire orientation efforts.

Regards,
Celeste Roberts

appropriate judge but she is very young and has a lot yet to learn.  This 
comment is not meant as a cut down at all.   John's questionable judgement

Steve,

Have you had a chance to look at the book ""Funky Business"" and to give any 
thought to having Jonas present at the Management Conference?  I know you 
have a thousand other things on your plate, not the least of which is 
California, so I understand if the answer is no.  However, they've been 
contacted by someone else about the date so we may be forced to decide rather 
soon.

On a related subject, I'm contemplating another topic for the conference.  
I'd seen an article in Fortune several months ago titled ""Managing for the 
Slowdown.""  It talked about new challenges managers face in light of the 
economic downturn.  (Most young managers have never experienced anything but 
boom times.)  The article also outlines a dozen or so things companies should 
be thinking about now.  (Use the downturn as a new opportunity to evaluate 
people.  Overhaul your budget process.  Don't stop communicating. etc.)  I 
think it would be beneficial to address similar strategies and ideas with our 
managers.  I'd love to get your thoughts on this idea.  (Is it appropriate 
for Enron or am I just seeing the world through bleak-colored glasses?)

 Terrie:

 We received an e-mail today from the Funky Business office asking about the
 date we have on hold with Enron.  They have another inquiry about that date 
and
 wondered if Enron is still considering using Jonas.  If you are still
 considering them I will keep him on hold.  And if they get a firm offer I 
will
 let you know immediately.  We will have 24 hours to make an offer or release
 the hold once a firm offer comes in from another company.

 Hope you had a great 4th of July,

and asked me to give you the confirmed list of attendees to the dinner in New 
York, Wednesday August 23, 8:00 P.M.
at the Watteau Room of the St. Regis Hotel:

 Sanford I. Weill   Citigroup, Inc.   Chairman and CEO
 Hendrick Verfaille  Monsanto Co.   President and CEO
 William B Harrison, Jr.  Chase Manhattan Corp.  Chairman and CEO

 Kenneth L. Lay   Enron Corp.   Chairman and CEO

Pending confirmation
 Douglas A. Warner III  J.P. Morgan   Chairman

According to Federico, if there is any late cancellation, no one will be 
substituted. Also, there is a small possibility that
the dinner could take place in Washington, rather than N.Y., based on Fox's 
meeting with President Clinton; they are still
working on the final agenda.

Dear?Jeff,
?
Greetings from Austin.? On behalf of Governor Bush, it  is my pleasure to 
invite you to join?the Governor's  IT National Steering Committee.??You have

Barksdale,?Scott McNealy,  plus many others).??NSC members are Republicans, 
Democrats, and  Independents who support Governor  Bush.??
?
In July, the group met here in Austin  to discuss burning issues in the 
technology community and to share them with  Governor Bush in a private 
meeting(the AP  wire story describing the event is at bottom).??To  give you 
a better idea of the nature and composition of the group, I have  attached a 
pdf file?of  an?April ad?that ranin USA Today?that  includes?a declaration of 
support by NSC members for Governor  Bush.
?
If you are interested in joining the NSC, please provide the  following:

the NSC and?keeping members abreast and plugged into campaign  events and 
policy matters, especially those that relate to New Economy and  technology 
issues.
?
Best regards,
?
Price Roe
on behalf of Dr. Bill Rice
?
P.S.? I recently graduated  from?HBS and think it would be great to?get 
another highly  accomplished HBS?alum like you on board in support of the  
Governor.

Bush meeting with high-tech council  


JIM VERTUNO, Wednesday  July 19, 8:53 am

Associated Press Writer AUSTIN, Texas (AP)???Gov. George W. Bush wants to 
compare  notes on issues ranging from Internet privacy, to cyber crime to 
closing the  so-called ``digital divide'' that sometimes leaves minority 
households behind in  the computer age during a planned Wednesday meeting 
with technology leaders.  About 130 members of the Bush campaign's 350-member 
high-tech council, including  Dell Computer Corp. chairman Michael Dell, were 
scheduled to meet behind closed  doors at Austin's Jewish Community Center.?. 
. 

``I am excited  about all of the opportunities that technology has given us 
to make a profound  and positive impact on the world,'' said Bush, the 
presumptive Republican  presidential nominee. ``America is a pioneer in the 
high-tech industry and it is  vital for us to maintain this status,'' Bush 
said. '' Leading the world in  innovation will not only improve the lives of 
Americans, but will also create  many quality jobs.'' 

The purpose of the meeting was to allow the group to  present Bush with their 
thoughts and share up-to-the minute information on the  issues, said Bush 
campaign spokesman Tucker Eskew. The campaign also was to  unveil its 
revamped Web site. One of its features will allow users to download  
event-specific posters or placards for campaign events.

 Electricity Crisis Cools Down a Bit in San Diego County, Calif. Dan McSwain 
? 09/26/2000 KRTBN Knight-Ridder Tribune Business News: North County Times - 
Escondido, California Copyright (C) 2000 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business 
News; Source: World Reporter (TM) 

An uneasy aftermath has settled over this summer's power price shocks in San 
Diego County, punctuated this weekend by cool weather and falling electricity 
prices, as the state and federal policy-making apparatus shifts from a season 
of panicked damage control to the extremely difficult question of what to do 
next.

In the parlance of the electricity industry, these are the ""shoulder"" months; 
a breather between periods of heavy demand for summer cooling and winter 
heating in which power-generating plants are typically pulled out of 
commission for trouble-shooting, overdue maintenance and refueling. 

California's pioneering deregulation of its electricity industry lies in a 
state of exhaustion. Guarantees from politicians of greater efficiency and 
lower prices have collapsed this summer into chronic power shortages and a 
historic transfer of wealth that in about 90 days moved $10.6 billion from 
the buyers of electricity to the sellers.

Optimism is in short supply as a fractious collection of stakeholders and the 
nation's political and regulatory institutions begin to search for solutions.

Emergency legislation approved by state lawmakers in August will temporarily 
reduce bills for the 1.2 million customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Co. 
from an average $146 in September to about $72 per month. In July 1999, San 
Diego County and parts of south Orange County became the first region in the 
nation under deregulation law to directly pay the wholesale price of 
electricity.

Cool weather has caused demand for power to sag this weekend, bringing prices 
down from their lofty summer peaks to about 7.5 cents per kilowatt hour on 
Friday.

But while the legislation has capped rates at 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour for 
SDGOcustomers, the utility will continue to pay the volatile wholesale cost 
of power, which averaged 21.4 cents this month. Historically, prices have 
fallen to as low as 1 cent per kilowatt in the winter months, but this year 
prices seem likely to exceed 6.5 cents for most of the year, and take off 
again in summer 2001.

Analysts say generating and power marketing companies will retain their 
ability to raise prices, called market power, because their costs are higher 
and supplies of power are tight in the Pacific Northwest.

SDGOsays the legislation could create a shortfall, to be financed by the 
company, that could run up an $800 million IOU by 2003. In the past, the 
Public Utilities Commission has allowed the utility to pass on such 
shortfalls to consumers in the form of higher rates.

Pacific Gas&Electric and Southern California Edison, the state's other 
investor-owned utilities, have collectively lost at least $3.3 billion this 
summer because their retail rates have remain capped under deregulation. Both 
utilities are seeking to end their retail rate caps early to escape the risk 
of sustained high wholesale prices.

Consumer groups are outraged; investors are skeptical. Three major credit 
rating companies said the California utilities face increased regulatory 
uncertainty, and the utilities' stock prices fell last week.

A hot-potato mentality is emerging among policy-makers who say the authority 
to clamp down on market behavior has been dispersed by deregulation.

California regulators and consumer advocates have great expectations for a 
series of state and federal investigations into the causes of higher prices 
and into charges of market manipulation and price gouging by power companies. 
Chief among them is an investigation by the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission that may lead to changes in California's power trading system.

""Unfortunately, we have ceded most of our authority over wholesale markets to 
the federal government,"" said Loretta Lynch, the president of the California 
Public Utilities Commission, the state's top regulator.

James Hoecker, the chairman of the federal commission, said Lynch overstates 
the case. ""California has not given me one scintilla of authority that I 
didn't already have,"" Hoecker said in August.

The federal commission has been critical of California's approach to 
deregulation, but has been reluctant to intervene in interstate wholesale 
markets, into state trading systems, or to make aggressive use of its 
investigative powers.

What is dawning on California policy-makers, analysts say, is the hard lesson 
that deregulation transfers considerable authority away from government 
officials and to the market participants. The challenge is to get 
deregulation right the first time.

""The problem is not deregulation,"" said Robert McCullough, an economist and 
former utility executive based in Portland, Ore. ""The problem is this Rube 
Goldberg device that has been constructed in California.""

The trading practices of power marketers in the West also is under scrutiny 
by the federal commission. Regulators informed electricity marketing 
companies in August that if price gouging is found, the refund of some 
profits may be ordered by the commission for windfall profits that are earned 
after mid-October.

A surprising number of observers say generators have simply acted in their 
own interest and taken advantage of the rules to make money. Ranging from 
consumer advocates to economists to some regulators themselves, many say 
bungled deregulation is a more likely cause of high prices than a conspiracy 
of generating companies.

""This market has behaved very rationally this summer,"" said Frank Wolak, a 
Stanford economist who chairs the market surveillance committee of 
California's power transmission manager. ""All you need is tight supply to 
exercise market power in this market; you don't need collusion.""

A titanic shift is shaping up in the way power is bought on the wholesale 
markets on behalf of California consumers. All three utilities have been 
granted authority by state regulators to make confidential deals for 
electricity directly with individual generators or power trading companies, 
largely bypassing the state's nonprofit power exchange.

In an equally important development, the manager of most of California's 
transmission system has asked federal regulators for permission to sign 
long-term deals for power. Up to now, the transmission manager has been 
limited to last-minute purchases of emergency power to stabilize the grid.

Critics fear both measures are steps toward reinstating the system that 
existed before deregulation, in which a small number of buyers made large, 
long-term deals with a handful of suppliers.

The architects of California's deregulation, fearing the monopoly power of 
the utilities, had stripped bilateral purchasing authority to foster 
competition among a new kind of retail power provider. Under the scheme, 
utilities were to be limited to the highly regulated business of electricity

Michelle/Lizsette;

I was wondering if circumstances with Jonathan Lane (the contract Help desk person whom I mentioned to you a week or so ago) have been resolved?  When we last spoke I mentioned that he went to Valeria Hope's group.  I am not sure of the outcome  of that visit, but I will tell  you that his negative attitude and general dissatisfaction on the team is becoming disruptive to the other help desk members. He is away from his desk often (having ""meetings"", which may be interviews for other positions), he has shared with the other team members his perceptions of management and his issues with us.  

If and when I can do so, I would like to terminate him.  I won't until I hear from you all, and we are documenting discussions as you requested.  I hope this can end soon, though because this is causing real problems here.

Great summary.  I think the two main issues you raise are the right ones, but 
I have one other thought we should discuss internally.  Do we want to create 
a set of incentives for the management of PJM that would entitle management 
to incentive compensation to the extent they meet certain goals -- eg 
relieving congestion on the grid, increasing throughput across the 
transmission system, expediting interconnection (measured in terms of actual 
interconnections not just applications approved), etc.  This way we could 
create an organization that would have the incentive to make a workable and 
open transmission system.

Attached is a summary of the PJM RTO order.  While it is somewhat lengthy, 
the order has a lot of good information in it that I wanted to share with the 
group, particularly the Commission's statements regarding the existing 
configuration of the northeast and the need to expand it.

We are working on summaries of the New York and New England RTO orders and 
will have those out shortly.  If you would like copies of the orders, just 
let us know.

We expect the mediation proceeding to begin within the next week.  We will 
keep you updated.

Subject: Re: Security Assessment Report  

Gabriel et al:

Looks like the risks to Enron travelers to (and employees in) Colombia have 
increased.  This is another indication that a 'travel policy' for travelers 
to Colombia should be in effect.  What happened to the one we were discussing 
earlier?  The steps outlined there would go a long way in improving the 
security of our travelers.

Control Risks' report discusses responses to the media - be sure you have the 
approval of Enron's media people before making any response.

The report also recommends suspending bidding on new projects - probably not 
viable advice, but reinforces the importance that additional security 
measures be built into all new projects from day one.

Now that our name is in front of the Colombian public, we could see 
retaliation for various acts, not all of which we have control over.  Recent 
US Government actions such as extraditing criminals to the US for trial and 
training Colombian anti-drug troops have done little to endear American 
businesses to the Colombian public, who see such actions as interfering with 
Colombia's right to govern themselves.  These actions have significantly 
raised the risk of all American companies and their employees in Colombia.

A meeting I had about two years ago with David Beddow of Control Risks in 
Bogota indicated that we could see some changes in the methods of attack in 
urban areas by FARC/ELN.  With an elevated risk level, we should begin 
thinking about these threats.  FARC seldom uses the car bomb method of attack 
because it generates little interest among the domestic or international 
media.  FARC plans on using letter bombs mailed to select targets, i.e., head 
of an American-owned corporation who may have an office in Bogota.  This 
method will generate headlines in the press and generate a fear of FARC among 
businessmen who may be targets.  Control Risks' reported timetable for this 
change in FARC's tactics was to be three to five years, but now that our risk 
is higher, the timetable may well be moved up.

On a related note - did you employ the security person we recommended?

Please let me know how I can help you.

My comments are attached.  I think the pleading is well written, but, as you'll see from my comments, I believe we should be incorporating more of the arguments from the previous pleading.

Subject:	Comments on Judge Wagner's Proposed Recommendation   

As you may be aware, the Chief Judge informed the parties to the settlement proceeding this afternoon that he intends to recommend to the Commission that it employ the June 19 rate methodology for the refund period from October 2 forward.

Attached are draft comments that Sarah Novosel and I propose to submit to the Judge and his legal staff tomorrow.  While we would like to convince the Judge that the June 19 methodology is not appropriate, we also provide a fallback approach.

Please review the comments (they are only 4 pages) and send your comments to us.  We plan to submit the comments tomorrow.

Thanks

Ray and Sarah

Here's what John found.  We will follow up with DeFazio.  He is extremely

positions.   Most pundits will see this for what it is, given the source.  
But we will see him soon.

Here is an initial draft from our attorneys in California on the state 
processes that could be required.  In my experience, the single biggest issue 
the utilities have is the transfer of the rights of way -- there are 
thousands of these -- each like an individual contract.  If the state tried 
eminent domain, it seems like it could face a long-time in the courts to 
finish that process.

Hi Steve,
Folks love Newsome, and I think he's very nice and appears to be very
free market.  Spears, the other Republican appointee is not at all free
market, in my view.  I would not like this to mentioned anywhere else, but I
have found that the farm reps on the Commission may sound deregulatory but
are not, and have been really troublesome without a good free market person
on board.  And there are no truly free market persons on  board at the
Commission (every single other agricultural rep that I worked with on the
Commission were trouble, even though they claimed to be deregulatory -- and
they were far worse before I got there and after I left.)
I visited with Newsome a day before Inauguration, and I was appalled at
what they were planning to do concerning agency structure -- that would have
elevated the regulatory lawyers and diminished the role of the economists at
the agency.  Misguided and showed to me a lack of understanding of how
organizational structures can affect what comes out of an agency.
I am often at odds with ""the industry view"" regarding CFTC issues.  I
don't think the futures exchanges, who have a lot of power, necessarily are
pro-competition; and many of the non-exchange folks who lobby on CFTC issues
are Washington or New York (Democrat - which is why they want to involve Ken
at this level) lawyers who do not understand markets and who are more
interested in being able to claim influence or impact.  The CFTC is in awful
shape -- the quality of staff is horrendous, and the Commission is relying on
some of the worst people for their policy work (same folks that Brooksley
Born used, same folks who have advocated more regulation of the OTC market
for years).  Many quality folks do not want the job as Chairman because it's
been such a backwater.  I am looking for some good folks.  Have  at least one
person who would be good at that job.  And it's not Newsome.  Please do not
share this information with the usual folks, as they hate me anyway (I'm too
free market and have argued against their ""fixes"").  Sorry for this scathing
review, but this is an important appointment.  Wendy","Re: Confidential --CFTC Chair. Hi Steve, Folks love Newsome, and I think he's very nice and appears to be very free market.

This responds to Charles's voice mail and the RTO conference calls that Janel has been on where we have discussed responding to those who say the heightened interest in security is a reason NOT to do large RTOs.  Jim Steffes is the EPSA witness on reliability and other issues at a Barton subcommittee hearing next Wed., Oct. 10th.  While the written testimony filed for the Sept. 11 hearing that was canceled is still operative, Jim's oral remarks can be whatever he wishes.  Also, even if he does not raise it in his opening statement, the issue will no doubt come up by others or in Q&A.

Thus -- any talking points need to be ready by Tuesday for this hearing.  Does not have to be anything fancy or hand-out quality.  Just something for Jim to consider using.  Charles, I do not recall any specific articles on what NERC said, but Sarah Novosel said she would check since she thought there was something like what you raised in your voice mail.","Reliability and Security Arguments (RTOs).

Also, even if he does not raise it in his opening statement, the issue will no doubt come up by others or in Q&A. Thus -- any talking points need to be ready by Tuesday for this hearing. Does not have to be anything fancy or hand-out quality. Just something for Jim to consider using. Charles, I do not recall any specific articles on what NERC said, but Sarah Novosel said she would check since she thought there was something like what you raised in your voice mail.",1,"Company Business, Strategy, etc."

Calling All Investors: The New Power Company's IPO Priced at $21 Per Share

TNPC, Inc., parent of The New Power Company, announced yesterday that its
initial public offering (IPO) of 24 million common shares was priced at
$21 per share. The stock closed yesterday at $27 per share. The Company
expects to receive net proceeds from the offering of its shares at=20
approximately
$473 million, exclusive of the underwriters' option to purchase an addition=
al
3,600,000 common shares to cover over allotments. TNPC, Inc.=01*a partnersh=
ip
between Enron, America Online (AOL) and IBM=01*was formed in late 1999 to
provide electricity and natural gas directly to households and small=20
businesses
in the deregulated energy marketplace. TNPC's shares will be listed on
the NYSE under the symbol NPW. Closing of the offering is expected to occur
Oct. 11.

ANALYSIS: I am sure that many eyebrows were raised when TNPC issued the
IPO of its stock at $21, a figure that seemed surprisingly high for a start=
-up
company that has been in operation only since early summer. It is rather
mind-boggling that a company with no significant track record could open
its stock at such a price, but it is not unheard of. In fact, TNPC is=20
following
a trend of new Internet companies initiating IPOs that are supported by
grand concepts rather than tangible success. However, the TNPC ""dream team""
alliance between Enron, AOL and IBM has been met with great expectations
(and a lot of skepticism as well) throughout the industry.

I read through the S-1/A filing that TNPC submitted to the SEC, so hopefull=
y
I can cut through the hype regarding this deal to get to its nucleus. First=
,
TNPC acknowledges repeatedly throughout its filing that it is entering
into an extremely high-risk venture, and in fact will ""incur substantial
operating and net losses, and cannot assure that we will attain=20
profitability.""
Further, TNPC admits that it expects to incur these losses for a=20
""significant,""
but undetermined, period of time. Why, then, would Wall Street be greeting
this IPO with such a positive welcome? One could easily argue that the
sheer market presence of Enron, AOL and IBM has by association driven up
the value of TNPC, but I think a deeper answer lies within several factors.

First, TNPC has been bankrolled by some hefty investments. In two separate,
private placements, investors such as Enron, GE Capital Equity Investments
and DLJMB Partners (among others) put up about $214 million in start-up
capital in exchange for shares in the company. Enron is the majority owner
of TNPC, with 57-percent control. This money has allowed TNPC to make=20
important
acquisitions. For instance, TNPC bought the residential and small commercia=
l
retail energy business of Columbia Energy Group, which includes approximate=
ly
285,000 natural-gas customers and 20,000 electricity customers in eight
states. This is a valuable card in TNPC's deck as it locks in customers
during this time when deregulation is developing slowly in retail markets.
I wouldn't be surprised if TNPC makes a similar acquisition of another
customer base in the near future, such as in Texas, where customers have
been spun off to energy service companies rather than being held by the
T&D operations of utilities. In other words, in Texas TNPC could easily
buy customers without having to buy wires or infrastructure, assuming there
is a willing seller.

Second, and perhaps more importantly, earlier this year Enron transferred
its residential and small commercial retail operations in California and
Ohio to TNPC. This deal included the operations of Enron Energy Services
but did not include PG&E Energy Services, which Enron acquired earlier
this year. Together with the Columbia Energy Group acquisition, TNPC has
come out of the gate running with a significant beginning customer base
of over 325,000 customers. Why would Enron have turned over its residential
customers to TNPC?  Don't forget that Enron struggled in and retreated
from the California residential market, stating that it couldn't make any
money in the retail market. TNPC's S1/A filing confirms rumors that Enron
Energy Services actually retreated from California due to a lawsuit claimin=
g
the company had violated laws relating to advertising directed to residenti=
al
consumers in 1997 and 1998. Enron was in fact banned from selling power
to the residential market in California. Under this customer transfer,
Enron is able to put its money into a completely separate business=01*essen=
tially
moving this high-risk business venture, and worst performing part of its
retail service, off its own books. Yet if TNPC succeeds, Enron still benefi=
ts
as it is the majority owner.

I think these two factors answer why Wall Street has looked so favorably
on a self-described ""new company with a limited operating history."" Looking
ahead, can TNPC maintain this comparatively high value of its stock?  Well,
there's both good news and bad news for TNPC. First, let's look on the
bright side. TNPC has put into place a great management team, starting
with H. Eugene Lockhart, formerly of AT&T, as president and CEO. Other
key players bring retail market expertise from work at MasterCard, Exxon
and PespiCo. In addition, within the energy industry, TNPC arguably could
not have a better backer than Enron. What other company's touch has been
golden in nearly every venture it has pursued? In addition to being the
majority owner, Enron probably is also providing TNPC access to commodities
at preferential prices, which will certainly enhance its sales approach
in the retail market. Plus, TNPC has access to the 24 million customers
that AOL represents, which I've always thought was the company's secret
weapon.

But then there are the risks, and they are substantial. First, competition
is not materializing rapidly on the retail side. In a state like Pennsylvan=
ia,
which perhaps represents the strongest deregulated market in the United
States, only about 16 percent of customers in PECO's territory have opted
to switch their provider. So, TNPC has an uphill climb, to say the least,
in making any inroads at capturing a lock=01*and making money=01*in the ret=
ail
market. Second, the only way that I can see TNPC making it at all is if
they continue to buy customers like they did from Columbia Energy Group.
There are big questions surrounding whether the company will be able to
do this or not, and much of its success hinges on this uncertainty.

Third, and perhaps most serious of all, is TNPC's vulnerability on the
technology side of its operation. TNPC has entered into a 10-year revenue
management and customer care agreement with IBM Global Services, under
which IBM will manage the company's online commerce and billing application=
s.
IBM's track record in developing customer care systems is less than stellar=
.
In fact, PG&E initiated a lawsuit against IBM a few years ago when the
utility had to pull the plug on a massive $100 million customer information
system (CIS), employed by IBM, which it claimed was ineffective. IBM has
partnered with SCT to provide the infrastructure to be used by TNPC. Under
an agreement between IBM Global Services and SCT, the SCT Banner CIS will
be integrated into a number of back-office IT solutions under development
by IBM for TNPC. Experts in the CIS industry have questioned whether SCT's
Banner CIS can handle over one million customers. If it cannot, this will
surely limit TNPC's growth potential.

Moreover, although TNPC's IPO signals a strong future, there are many=20
uncertainties
surrounding this nascent operation. As one of the few major players in
the energy retail market, TNPC has very few competitors, with the possible
exceptions of NewEnergy or GreenMountain. Another competitor is also emergi=
ng
in Britain's Centrica, which plans to expand in North America after its
recent acquisition of Canadian retail gas supplier Direct Energy.=20
Consequently,
the coming year could either make or break TNPC and the challenges that
the company faces in wanting to conquer the retail market are extremely
steep.

Steve and Cindy,

Attached is the electronic ""Save the Date"" memo for the Management Conference.  We are preparing to send it out next week.  Please let me know if you have any comments or concerns on the e-mail.  

As for distribution, we've worked with HR on the distribution list for VPs; but will circle back with David Oxley's team to ensure we have the most up-to-date list.  Since some VPs in redeployment will most likely find positions within Enron by November, I don't plan to exclude them from the distribution ... unlike United Way, where we are not soliciting employees in redeployment for a contribution.

I look forward to any feedback.

		 Subject: Pipeline safety legislation - update

Since the defeat of the Senate pipeline safety legislation earlier this week 
in the House, we have been working on strategies related to action that could 
occur before the end of the congressional session.  The following 
developments indicate that the legislation is still very much in play, but 
our primary concerns are making sure efforts going forward remain under 
control and preventing the passage of legislation that goes too far.

Developments:

House Republican leadership is not interested in pursuing the legislation any 
further, either through regular procedures or as an attachment to 
appropriations, ""omnibus"" or other must-pass measures.   They are somewhat 
angry at the industry for not being able to fight off advances made by Reps. 
Dingell and Oberstar, who were able to persuade enough Democrats to vote 
against the Senate bill so that it fell short of the 2/3 needed for passage 
under suspension of the rules.

Senate bill sponsors/supporters are extremely angry at House Democrats for 
killing the Senate legislation, and at the White House/DOT for not strongly 
promoting the Senate bill (which they previously had supported) and reigning 
in House Democrats.   Senator Patty Murray called the White House and 
expressed her concern, which prompted a series of meetings between staff for 
Senate and House Democrats and the White House to discuss a solution.   

In these meetings, House Democrats have proposed adding several provisions 
from the Dingell/Oberstar legislation to the Senate bill and moving that 
package on an omnibus or appropriations bill.   Sources close to Rep. Dingell 
indicate that they really do not want any bill at all, and are merely keeping 
up the pressure in an effort to see if they can get the Senate or industry to 
accept tougher provisions.

Senate Democrats (including Murray, Bingaman, and Breaux) are not accepting 
any possible amendments to the original Senate bill, and are opposed to 
changing the Senate bill at all.   However, Senator Murray and Republican 
Senator Slade Gorton (who has a tough election) both want to continue to 
pursue the Senate bill (unamended) as a rider to an omnibus/appropriations 
bill.    

The White House is looking to cover itself from a poor performance in the 
House, and is considering drafting an executive order that could be issued if 
no legislation passes at all.  It is unclear what could or would be contained 
in such an order, but the White House is indicating to Senate staff that it 
would be more like the Senate bill than the House bill.  We are working with 
sources close to the White House to confirm their strategy.

Strategy going forward:

Upon hearing that some industry associations were on Capitol Hill discussing 
""what industry could live with"" in terms of provisions added to the Senate 
bill, I insisted (along with El Paso and others) that we not take such an 
approach, but rather remain consistent in our approach -- we support the 
Senate bill and only the Senate bill.   It was approved unanimously in the 
Senate and by 60% of the House, and if anything moves forward on an 
omnibus/appropriations bill, it should be the Senate bill.  Consistent with 
what our Senate friends are doing, we should not even recognize the 
Dingell/Oberstar legislation as a serious proposal, nor start accepting 
pieces of it as a compromise.

We will be shoring up support for our position of ""if anything moves forward, 
it should be the Senate bill only"" with Senate supporters and leadership in 
the House and Senate.  We will also be working to thank the 51 Democrats who 
supported us in the House, and make sure they have any cover they need in 
case their vote becomes an issue.   In support of Senator Gorton's election 
troubles, we will be working to try to get media placement of op-eds that 
support the efforts he has waged and make sure the House Democrats shoulder 
the blame for the bill's defeat.  In particular, we are hopeful that Senator 
McCain (who has been passionate about this issue) will write op-eds that can 
be placed to support Gorton and others in tough races who supported the 
Senate bill.

Congress' state of confusion over omnibus/appropriations bills and last 
minute politics causes the legislative activity to be extremely fluid and 
subject to change rapidly, so we will have no real certainty until the 
session is over (which now could be as late as October 20).  

I will keep you posted as changes and developments occur.

		 Subject: FERC's marketing affiliate conference

Becky and I attended FERC's gas marketing affiliate conference last week.  
Non-affiliated competitors continue to build straw men and describe abuses 
with no real evidence to back them up (the funny money argument and capacity 
hoarding are two examples.  The funny money argument assumes marketing 
affiliates will bid above market rates for capacity because they excess 
payment is going to the corporate bottom line.  Hoarding capacity to drive up 
price  may be an issue, but it is not a marketing affiliate issue, as anyone 
can do it). FERC staff did not seem terribly sympathetic to the points made, 
but at least one FERC staffer seemed to believe that one solution would be to 
require the pipelines to offer capacity in smaller blocks to let smaller 
entities put together bids.  FERC also indicated they were in fact auditing 
compliance, but in a non-public way.

There were some concerns voiced which I agree with and there is an 
opportunity to file additional comments on Apr. 30.  I would like to put the 
following in these comments:

Evidence of affiliate abuse/preference is just not there.  The best folks can 
do is make up stuff.
We welcome FERC monitoring if that is needed to bring confidence to the 
marketplace that abuse is not occurring.  But the issue is really whether we 
do have a crisis of confidence or merely a bunch of disgruntled competitors 
who are just seeking to neutralize the affiliated competitors).
The FERC rules and the information reported (with a caveat) under those rules 
are adequate for detection and enforcement and deterrence.
That said, the definition of marketing affiliate should be expanded to 
include affiliated electric generators, who are siting plants along affiliate 
pipelines.
The pipeline 637 reporting and internet systems should allow users to 
download and manipulate transportation related data, which is not currently 
the case.

We also need to address a deal on Northern where ENA took capacity at a 
discount, albeit after other parties had an opportunity to match our bid.  
This was a deal brought up in the conference.

Let me know how this sounds. Thanks.

Itochu Corporation, a Japanese trading company with which we are developing a

identified an opportunity to source LNG from Libya for the purposes of 
importing to Japan, either directly or through an LNG swap.

What is Enron's current policy on dealing with Libya?

		 Subject: Draft NPC Report

Rob:

Thought I'd send you the latest draft of the report, it's 85-90%  final (the 
recommendations are 100%).

Questions the report raises for Enron:

Is Enron part of the oil & natural gas sector or the banking and finance 
sector?  Both are looking at information sharing mechanism to mitigate risks 
to IT systems.  The Banking & Finance sector has been operating an 
information sharing and analysis center (ISAC) for over a year.  Discussions 
with members of the banking and finance sector indicate it has value.  

If Enron is a part of the oil & natural gas sector, are we willing to take a 
leadership role and enter into a potential LLC with other Council member 
companies to form an ISAC for this sector? Cost to Enron would be based on 
number of individuals receiving alerts etc., however, it could be as low as 
$13K per year.  An additional cost would be to appoint an employee to the 
LLC's governance body to ensure Enron's needs were addressed.  Archie Dunham, 
CONOCO's Chairman, has agreed to champion this initiative if the Council 
recommends it at the 6 June  meeting.

Current coordination:

The legal issues have been worked by a sub-group lead by Tom Carmel, CONOCO.  
Mark Holsworth, Corp. Legal has been our representative.  Recent DOJ action 
regarding information sharing to mitigate IT risks seems to indicate that 
anti-trust will not be an issue.  Steptoe & Johnson, LLP have undertaken a 
review of the liability issues and suggested ways to mitigate them.

Mike Hicks and I have been working with Mark Thibodeaux, Corp. IT Compliance, 
and will be meeting with Steve Kean and others in the security and IT 
protection efforts in next two weeks. 

Recommendation:

Enron participate fully in the oil and natural gas sector's efforts - As 
Enron becomes more and more dependant on IT, having a mechanism that provides 
tailored vulnerability information and solutions in a ""one-stop-shop"" format 
is valuable and can lead to reduced insurance premiums.

A ""dedicated room"" isn't as bad as it sounds.  It would not be in use full 
time and the only equipment requirements are 4 screens (which one of the team 
rooms can accomodate) and a network connection (which the team rooms already 
have).  Let me know what you think.  Also: I talked to Salisha about Lara's 
move and it's ok with me (I think we were originally concerned that she 
wanted space we were setting aside for graphics, but she is actually moving 
deeper into her group (and next to her files)).

Subject: Dedicated eSpeak Room

Steve and Mark:

eSpeak is gaining tremendous momentum to become the communication vehicle for 
Enron's business units. In the first quarter of 2000, we estimate at least 
one eSpeak session per week -- and growing.  Jeff and Joe have personally 
committed to an Office of the Chairman eSpeak event every two weeks.  Cliff 
Baxter, Cindy Olson and Tom Gros are scheduled for January events.  We are in 
the process of scheduling Ken Lay, Ken Rice, Kevin Hannon, Marty Sunde and 
Joe Hillings.

As eSpeak events currently take place in different locations, there is an 
incredible amount of time and energy required to set up and test the 
equipment and infrastructure for each event.  It is crucial to have a 
dedicated eSpeak room.  Preferably this room should be on the 47th floor 
where the eThink team can train executives in advance and conduct each eSpeak 
session.  The ideal and most efficient scenario would be to set up the 
equipment (four terminals) in an office space on 47, where the equipment will 
be secure and the Public Affairs group can still use the office as extra work 
space.

We request your authorization to move forward.  As we are moving into new 
space, this is the perfect time to dedicate a room.

Please feel free to call me at x39843 or Marie at x39698.

Sincerely,

The eThink Team

Agreed.  Trying to be too cute with our strategy is difficult. 

Look, about 4 years ago we pulled out of the market.  I think that we need to 
simply accept that these customers are going back sooner or later.  NPC won't 
even pick this up.

I like the idea, particularly if we can time any decision to turn the 
customers back so it falls after the failure to get some action out of Sacto 
(instead of after our earnings release).   

The only problem I see is that we would need a decision from the top that 
we're not going to turn the customers back if we get direct access (so we can 
end the debate).  I don't think it helps us if we get lucky, get direct 
access back, then make a decision to return customers to the utility.

Before any decision is made, I think we really need to weigh in with EES on 
the ramifications (both PR and legislative) of turning back 16,000 
residential customers.  I strongly believe that the public hit we will take 
will be far greater than our actual out-of-pocket losses.  We will be 
crucified by the public, media, consumer groups, legislators, governor, 
attorney general, etc.,  and this action will reaffirm our reputation of 
packing up and leaving when it's not in our interest.  The impact of this 
action would be exacerbated since it is on the heels of UC/CSU.  

I would also argue that this hurts our national dereg efforts.  If we're 
advocating that competition and choice benefits consumers and then we turn 
around and pull out of a market and abandon customers when we're not 
""profiting,"" we'll kill any chances we have of ever serving retail customers 
in California -- or in any other state.  We look foolish advocating for 
direct access when we're not willing to serve our existing -- let alone 
future customers 

What about a preemptive strike that engages these 16,000 customers to weigh 
in on direct access -- i.e. a letter that says ""Enron may be forced to cancel 
its contract -- call/write/send the enclosed postcard to your legislator and 
tell them you want to keep your right to choose your energy service provider.""

Our credibility is on the line.  Before we take this action, we need to be 
cognizant of all the long-range strategic implications, and we need to 
seriously weigh the negative impact this will have on our corporate 
reputation, on our legislative abilities and on our commercial success going 
forward.

In the meeting today, no decision was made about what to do with Enron's 
16,000 residential customers.   Each of the contracts gives a basic 30 day 
out right to Enron.

That being said, I think that we have a short window to push for DA before 
any public action impacts us in Sacramento.  

I realize that the ultimate action (which I think is inevitable) makes it 
harder for our advocacy on DA, but real $ are flowing out of the company.

EES will give us notice when a decision is reached.

Thanks,

'Tonight Show' pokes fun at power crisis 
 
By Fred Shuster
Staff Writer 
 
BURBANK -- Jay Leno pulled the plug on his late-night chat show Thursday, doing his part for the state's energy crisis, but viewers weren't left in the dark. 
Flashlights, mining helmets and multicolor glow sticks helped to illuminate the set for the show dubbed a one-time-only ""The Tonight Show Unplugged,"" which Leno said saved enough electricity to light a house for a month. 
 [IMAGE] 	
 The ""unplugged"" edition of ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno"" pokes fun at the California power crisis(Reed Saxon / A.P.) 	


Call it NBC's ""Can't See TV."" 
""This is not some cheap rating ploy. ... If this works, they're gonna make us do this every night,"" Leno joked as part of his opening monologue. 
The nationally broadcast show, featuring a comic interlude with California Gov. Gray Davis, utilized just a small amount of electricity to run the cameras, Leno said before the show began. 
Actually, in Burbank, where the taping took place at NBC Studios, the city owns the power company and residents and businesses have not been hit by rolling blackouts as in other areas. The city made $5 million in profit in May after racking up $60 million in excess power sales. 
But Leno said not using studio lights, TV monitors, amplifiers and other power sources Thursday saved enough electricity to light a four-bedroom house for a month. 
Members of the house band wore miner's helmets, with group leader Kevin Eubanks strumming an acoustic guitar rather than his regular electric instrument. 
The stage was lit by candles, torches and flashlight beams trained on Leno. Members of the studio audience used the gear to help brighten the set. 
""This is real goofy,"" Leno said before taping got under way. ""We'll see what happens."" Guests included Arsenio Hall, Gilbert Gottfried, a trainer of nocturnal animals and a Hawaiian fire dancer -- and a brief visit from the governor. 
Exuding whatever is the direct opposite of charisma, Davis had a brief exchange with Leno, drawing laughs with the line, ""This is the first time Gray Davis and (the word) electricity have ever appeared in the same sentence."" 
Leno's staff wore glasses with small lights attached and audience prompter Bob Perlow held a hand-scrawled applause sign aloft throughout the show instead of switching on the usual electric model. 
While there was little energy in play, there was no shortage of laughs. 
Leno joked that President George W. Bush told Davis not to worry because, ""I've been operating in the dark for years."" 
Those in the studio said Leno's nocturnal transmission added excitement to the program. 
""It was cool,"" said Lillie Harrell, 17, a tourist from Hammond, La. ""The crowd got really involved. I guess it shows you don't really need all those lights."" 
Added Jose Tano, 21, a Burbank resident and student at the University of California, Los Angeles, ""It was a good idea and a great way to make a point."" 
The local power company might not have made out very well, but the studio audience didn't end up empty-handed. Each received a fluorescent lantern and pack of batteries as they left the studio.

Wisconsin Gas to Purchase Nine Mile Line From Northern Natural Gas

07/13/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

Line Will Enhance Competition in Southeast Wisconsin and Use Existing 
Facilities 

MILWAUKEE, July 13 /PRNewswire/ -- Wisconsin Gas, Northern Natural Gas and 
Guardian Pipeline announced today that Wisconsin Gas has signed an agreement 
with Northern Natural Gas (NNG) to purchase a nine mile, high pressure 
natural gas pipeline in Walworth and Waukesha counties. The purchase price is 
$5 million. The proposed transaction will require approval from federal and 
state regulators. The pipe, known as the Eagle line, is located southeast of 
the Kettle Moraine Forest near Eagle, Wis.
The existing line has been part of the NNG interstate transmission system. 
Under the new ownership, the line will become part of the Wisconsin Gas 
distribution system and will interconnect with Guardian Pipeline as well as 
the NNG system. 
""Northern Natural Gas is pleased to be a part of a creative, cost-effective 
solution to provide additional gas service to southeastern Wisconsin,"" said 
Dave Neubauer, vice president of business development and marketing, Northern 
Natural Gas. ""This transaction enables Wisconsin Gas and its customers to 
obtain natural gas supplies from Guardian or NNG. Providing reliable, 
economical choices for consumers will benefit all of the parties involved."" 
""We saw this as an opportunity to minimize environmental impact and still 
realize the benefits of increased competition in the natural gas market,"" 
said James Schott, senior vice president, Wisconsin Gas. ""The purchase of the 
Eagle line will enable Wisconsin Gas to further our goal of providing 
cost-efficient natural gas service to our customers."" 
As a result of the purchase Guardian Pipeline, the 141-mile interstate 
pipeline from Joliet, Ill. to Ixonia, Wis., will no longer build an 8.5-mile 
lateral to Eagle. The lateral was part of the originally certified Guardian 
Pipeline. This portion of the line would have generally run parallel to the 
current Northern Natural pipeline. 
""This sale is a win-win situation for Guardian and consumers,"" said George 
Hass, project manager of Guardian Pipeline. ""The Eagle line purchase by 
Wisconsin Gas saves Guardian time and resources by taking away the need to 
build the 8.5-mile lateral and allows all three companies to create a better 
environment for competition in the natural gas marketplace."" 
The existing gate stations at LaGrange and Eagle will remain in-service for 
regulation purposes. Odorization and measurement will take place at a new 
gate station that will be constructed at the interconnect with Guardian. This 
new gate station will be called the Bluff Creek station and will be located 
near Whitewater. The Bluff Creek gate station will be constructed during the 
construction of Guardian Pipeline. 
Northern Natural Gas, a subsidiary of Enron Corp., with a market area 
capacity of about 4.3 Bcf/d, provides natural gas transportation services to 
utility customers in the upper Midwestern United States through its 
approximately 16,000 miles of pipeline. 
Guardian Pipeline is a partnership of three Midwestern energy companies: CMS 
Energy, based in Dearborn, Mich.; Wisconsin Energy, headquartered in 
Milwaukee, Wis.; and Viking Gas Transmission Co., a wholly owned subsidiary 
of Xcel Energy Inc., and located in St. Paul, Minn. 
Wisconsin Electric-Wisconsin Gas, the principal utility subsidiary of 
Wisconsin Energy Corp. (NYSE: WEC), serves more than one million electric 
customers and more than 960,000 natural gas customers throughout Wisconsin 
and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Visit our company's Web site at

Commodities Review: LME Copper Hit By Another Stock Rise
By Mark Long and Steve McGrath
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

07/13/2001
Dow Jones Commodities Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Copper futures traded in London fell Friday, as a 
further influx of stocks into official warehouses put the copper market under 
pressure and dragged down the rest of the base metal complex. 
Three-month copper traded on the London Metal Exchange ended $6 down from 
Thursday's late kerb close at $1,554.50 a metric ton.
An increase of 7,475 tons of copper into LME warehouses Friday brought total 
stocks up to a 12-month high of 550,300 tons. This pressured prices in early 
trade down to test $1,550/ton support, although prices recovered slightly in 
later trade. 
Unconfirmed market talk said Enron is behind much of the week's stock rise, 
in an effort to ease nearby supply tightness and to alleviate the large short 
positions it is thought to have built up on the July-for-a-week spread, which 
is currently showing a $6-$8/ton backwardation. The July futures contract 
will switch over to cash Monday. 
Enron declined to comment on the market talk Friday. 
A backwardation is a pricing structure in which deliveries to be made in the 
near future are more expensive then those set for a more distant delivery. 
The opposite situation is called contango. 
""The spreads are still tight. The major longs are still reluctant to lend, 
with no signs of that (tightness) dissipated,"" said Kevin Norrish, an analyst 
with Barclays Capital in London. 
Dealers and analysts said they expect further stock increases next week. 
The entire base metals complex ignored Thursday's 237-point rally in the Dow 
Jones Industrial Average, dealers said. 
""Copper has been sensitive to moves in the stock market, but not this time,"" 
Norrish said. In fact, now it appears that base metals markets ignore 
equities markets when they rally, but follow stocks down when they slump, he 
added. 
European Grain Futures See Profit-Taking, But More Gains Expected 
European grain and oilseed futures were hit by a bout of profit-taking and 
pre-weekend position-squaring Friday, after rising to long-time highs, 
brokers said. 
However, world and domestic crop concerns, the strength of the dollar and 
general bullish sentiment will carry the markets to fresh highs short term, 
they said. 
On the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, the 
benchmark November feed wheat contract ended just 25 pence up at GBP82/ton, 
after hitting a new two-year high of GBP83/ton in early trade. 
Meanwhile, Matif November rapeseed futures fell EUR2.75 on the day to 
EUR265/ton, after hitting a three-year high of EUR271/ton in early trade. 
The U.K. wheat crop and the French rapeseed crop are forecast to be well down 
on last year, and wheat and canola crops in some other major producing 
countries are also expected to fall. 
Meanwhile, the strength of the dollar is allowing European grain and oilseed 
traders to up prices and still remain competitive against U.S. imports and 
dollar-denominated grains on the world market.

LME Base Metals: Copper Pressured Down By Stock Build

07/13/2001
Dow Jones Commodities Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- London Metal Exchange three-month copper ended Friday's 
late kerb lower compared with Thursday, pressured by another stock build, 
dealers said. 
(LME three-month metals prices in dollars a metric ton at 1600 GMT, with the 
previous late kerb close in parentheses. Comex copper at 1641 GMT in cents a 
pound, with the previous close in parentheses.) Copper 1,554.50 (1,560.50) 
Tin 4,452.50 (4,502.50) 
Aluminum 1,452.25 (1,458.50) Zinc 871.50 (877.50) 
Nickel 5,925.00 (6,012.50) Lead 462.50 (465.00) 
Comex Sep Copper 70.75 (70.80)
An increase of 7,475 tons of copper Friday brought total stocks up to a 
12-month high of 550,300 tons. This pressured prices in early trade down to 
test $1,550/ton support before rising slightly to close at $1,554.50/ton, 
down from Thursday's close of $1,560.50/ton. 
Unconfirmed market talk said Enron is behind much of the week's stock rise, 
in an effort to ease nearby supply tightness and to alleviate the large short 
positions it is thought to have built up on the July-for-a-week spread, which 
is currently showing a $6-$8/ton backwardation. The July futures contract 
will switch over to cash Monday. 
Enron declined to comment on the market talk. 
A backwardation is a pricing structure in which deliveries to be made in the 
near future are more expensive then those set for a more distant delivery. 
The opposite situation is called contango. 
""The spreads are still tight. The major longs are still reluctant to lend, 
with no signs of that (tightness) dissipated,"" said Kevin Norrish, an analyst 
with Barclays Capital in London. 
Dealers and analysts said they expect further stock increases next week. 
The entire base metals complex ignored Thursday's 237-point rally in the Dow 
Jones Industrial Average, dealers said. 
""Copper has been sensitive to moves in the stock market, but not this time,"" 
Norrish said. In fact, now it appears that base metals markets ignore 
equities markets when they rally, but follow stocks down when they slump, he 
added. 
Aluminum also ended the late kerb lower Friday. 
News of the restart of some smelters has dampened sentiment, despite a stock 
drawdown of around 8,000 tons since the end of last week, dealers said. 
""The stock drawdowns are fairly small percentage-wise,"" said Standard Bank 
analyst Robin Bhar, adding that they would need to be much larger to 
significantly improve market sentiment. 
""A test of $1,435/ton cannot be ruled out, though we would expect forward 
buying to prevent a break below this level for the time being,"" Barclays said 
in a market report. 
Zinc continued its slump, falling to a seven-and-a-half-year low, mainly on 
technicals. 
Technicals also hurt nickel, which rose slightly after breaking $5,900/ton 
support but still closed at its lowest level since April. 
Nickel's fall was ""just on some speculative liquidation and short selling, 
mostly chart-based,"" Bhar said.

UK: Telecoms, drugs drive FTSE 100 rally, Vodafone leads.
By Camila Reed

07/13/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, July 13 (Reuters) - Britain's largest companies raced higher at the 
close on Friday fired by telecoms and drug stocks as they bounced back from 
Wednesday's 16-week low. 
Index heavyweights Vodafone and GlaxoSmithKline provided 27 of the day's 
55-point gain, while technology firms wobbled. However, the telecoms giant 
surged 4.1 percent to 157-1/4p.
The FTSE 100 finished 55.4 points or one percent firmer at 5,537.0, having 
jumped 1.66 percent on Thursday after seven consecutive losing sessions, with 
gainers outnumbering losers by three to one. 
Stocks steamed higher and refused to be derailed by sluggish U.S. retail 
sales figures for June, which showed only a meagre rise, and a weaker Wall 
Street, but volumes were thin at 1.4 billion shares. 
By London's 1530 GMT finish the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average was 
down five points, while the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index was flat, 
having streaked up in the previous session. 
Mike Lenhoff and Simon Rubinsohn at money managers Gerrard said that the UK 
equity market was deeply oversold and long-term this presented a buying 
opportunity for UK equities. 
DRUGS SEE-SAW 
Drugs reversed an earlier decline with Nycomed Amersham among the day's top 
performers, up nearly four percent at 536-1/2p and AstraZeneca rising over 
one percent. 
Mining giant Anglo American moved into the FTSE 100 top ten gainers with a 
three percent rise, as investors sought refuge in mining stocks as a cyclical 
play. 
Another major gainer was British business services firm Hays Plc up 3.4 
percent. The shares leapt on market talk that Germany's Deutsche Post was 
looking to make a bid for it, dealers said. 
Both Deutsche Post and Hays declined to comment. 
Firmer crude prices gave support to the oil sector. BP rose 0.6 percent to 
572 pence and Shell also added 0.6 percent to 581-1/2p lifting the index by 
four points. 
FTSE MIXED PICTURE 
But dealers and analysts said it would be a mixed picture going forward with 
the market scrutinising data for signs of a sustained economic recovery or a 
lapse in consumer confidence. 
""This week we had a really bloody day on Wednesday and then the opposite on 
Thursday, so we're going to be on a rollercoaster still. It's very fragile 
but it does show the potential of the market,"" said Foreign & Colonial 
director of UK equities David Manning. 
""It's not only the holiday period, it's also that the market can make you 
look an idiot one day to the next. In that sort of circumstance the 
temptation is to do very little,"" he said. 
ABN Amro strategist Gareth Williams said the market would make modest 
progress over the next month or so, with moves downward quite likely although 
the trend would be upwards over the course of the year. 
TECHS DIP 
Thursday's 5.3-percent rally in the Nasdaq failed to bring any cheer to UK 
technology shares. Logica and Colt Telecom slid four percent, while microchip 
designer ARM fell 3.9 percent to 223 pence trimming Thursday's 13 percent 
jump. 
The techMARK index of technology shares rose 0.98 percent to 1,602.87. 
Elsewhere on the downside, UK holiday operator Airtours lost nearly 10 
percent of its value after Swiss peer Kuoni issued a profit warning. 
Among second liners, Baltimore Technologies closed up 3.3 percent. It 
initially rallied 22 percent after the Irish Internet security firm said it 
received an approach from an unlisted British-based company for an all-paper 
deal to combine the companies. 
The FTSE 250 Mid-cap index finished 5.1 points stronger at 6,163.8. 
Among small-caps, Paladin Resources' shares jumped 10 percent after the UK 
oil explorer said that major shareholder U.S. oil giant Enron had sold the 
whole of its 40-million-share stake via HSBC bank for 44 pence a share. 
Britain's Litho Supplies Plc slumped 42.5 percent after the company, which 
supplies printing and graphic arts products, said that sales in the first six 
months of 2001 were on target, but profits would likely be below expectations 
due to tough market conditions and pressure on margins.

Futures Contract Covering Coal Debuts in New York (Correct)
2001-07-13 08:48 (New York)

Futures Contract Covering Coal Debuts in New York (Correct)

     (Corrects location of FirstEnergy Corp. in 10th paragraph of
story that moved yesterday.)

     New York, July 12 (Bloomberg) -- The New York Mercantile
Exchange today began trading a futures contract for low-sulfur
coal, a fuel that President George W. Bush said will play a major
role in meeting electricity demand over the next two decades.
     The contract's debut came after prices for coal, considered
the dirtiest of power-plant fuels, doubled in the past year, as
demand from power plants outstripped mine production. Coal for
September delivery opened at $42 a ton and settled at $40.75, as
98 contracts were traded, exchange officials said.
     ``We had a big run-up in coal prices this past winter,'' said
Andy Ozley, who buys coal for Atlanta-based Mirant Corp.'s six
coal plants in New York, Illinois, Maryland and Virginia. ``This
contract affords us a way to mitigate our exposure'' to large
price swings.
     The Bush administration said in an energy policy report this
spring that coal would be the dominant fuel for electricity
generation through 2020. Bush gave an added boost to the fuel when
he retreated from a campaign pledge to restrict carbon dioxide
emissions, implicated in global warming.
     Coal plants are responsible for a third of the nation's
carbon dioxide emissions. They also produce sulfur dioxide, which
causes acid rain, and nitrogen oxides, which cause smog.
     The Nymex started the futures contract to give mining
companies and utilities a way to hedge their risks in the $33
billion coal market. Producers such as Peabody Energy Corp. and
Arch Coal Inc., whose shares have soared in the past year, have
said they would trade the futures.

                            New Plants

     Last year's quadrupling of prices for natural gas -- a
cleaner-burning power-plant fuel -- prompted many generators to
ramp up output from their coal plants. Utility coal stockpiles
dwindled, and prices have risen to their highest levels since at
least 1989.
     So far this year, more than a dozen companies have announced
plans to build coal-fired plants, including Kansas City, Missouri-
based Kansas City Power & Light Co. and Portland, Oregon-based
PacifiCorp.
     Although coal is used to produce 52 percent of the nation's
electricity, few plants were built during the 1990s because of the
high costs of building them and the difficulty of complying with
federal and local environmental regulations.
     Demand for coal has eased in recent weeks as below-normal
temperatures in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast reduced demand for
air conditioning, said Jim Parks, who buys coal for six power
plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania as director of fuels at Akron,
Ohio-based FirstEnergy Corp.
     ``The summer's been pretty mild so far -- you haven't seen
any big heat waves'' in regions with the most coal generation, he
said.

                           Big Sandy

     The Nymex futures contract calls for the delivery of 1,550
tons of low-sulfur coal to the mouth of the Big Sandy River near
Huntington, West Virginia. From there, the fuel would be loaded
onto Ohio River barges and shipped to power plants in the U.S. and
possibly Europe.
     The new contract is tailored to producers in Appalachian
states that account for about 40 percent of U.S. production,
including West Virginia, Kentucky and Pennsylvania, the No. 2, 3
and 4 coal producers.
     The industry lacks a futures contract for coal from Western
states that account for 47 percent of the nation's production,
including the No. 1 producer, Wyoming.

                         Avoiding the Past

     The exchange, which earns commissions on trades, hopes coal
futures will avoid the fate of other contracts it has started over
the past few years. Its six electricity futures contracts have
fizzled, as has its Middle East sour crude oil contract, which
debuted in May 2000.
     ``I said yesterday, if you traded 100 to 200 contracts, that
would be a really a good day,'' said Chris Casale, vice president
of energy trading at Dynegy Inc. in Houston, which trades coal and
buys the fuel for its six power plants in New York and Illinois.
``It came out sort of on target.''
     Most of today's trading was originated by large energy
marketing companies, he said, although he declined to say whether
Dynegy traded any contracts. Enron Corp., the largest energy
trader, and Duke Energy Corp., the largest U.S.-based utility
holding company, have said they would trade coal futures.
     Exchange officials have said the coal market has the
potential to reach 5,000 trades a day after a year of trading.
     The Nymex's 17-year-old crude oil futures contract averages
about 66,700 trades a day, and its 11-year-old natural gas
contract averages about 33,500.

                           Wary of Coal

     ``The coal market is still lacking liquidity,'' said Anthony
McAuley, a floor broker at ABN Amro Inc., who said he bought five
coal contracts for a client at $42 a ton -- the market's first
transaction. ``You probably need to see a little more
participation'' from industry coal buyers and sellers for the
market to take off.
     Independent floor traders, known as locals, are wary of
trading coal futures without assurances that the industry will be
active as well.
     ``Floor traders lost millions'' in electricity futures when
some were caught with high-priced contracts and nobody in the
industry to sell them to, he said.
     ``Because of that, people are a little bit tentative about
coal,'' said Tom Schiff, an independent crude oil trader. ``We're
here to help make liquidity but we can't tackle all the risk.''






		
		
		
		Modern Metals, July 2001

		
		
		Giant energy concern now turns its attention to steel. The company's 
aggressive posture has begged controversy. Industry reactions vary from 
hand-wringing to open arms. Still others characterize Enron as a ""non-event.""
		By Michelle
Martinez Arjona,
Editor-in-Chief,
and Paul Hohl,
Contributing Editor
		
		These days, saying the word ""Enron"" in a room full of metals executives is 
like screaming ""fire"" in a crowded theater. For most in the steel industry, 
the idea of a futures market is enough to raise a few eyebrows. But when a 
major market maker with annual revenues of 10 times the market cap of the 
U.S. steelmaking industry stakes a claim (for 2000 alone, Enron logged 
revenues of $101 billion--that's with a ""b""), a lot more than eyebrows are 
likely to be raised. After a bold presentation from Jeff McMahon, president 
and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets, at the SSCI annual convention in May (in 
which he accused steel mills of treating their service center customers as 
""annoyances""), industry leaders rushed to understand this latest market 
contender. 
		Friend or foe? Competitor or partner? These are just a couple of the 
questions surrounding Enron's aggressive push into the metals industry. 
Judging from the service center and mill executives Modern Metals queried, 
there are as many answers as there are opinions in the industry. Reactions 
ranged from fear to acceptance to downright resentment. At least one mill was 
reticent to discuss Enron at all--still others seemed to meet the issue with 
unaffected shrugs. If the saying is true that all publicity is good 
publicity, the buzz that Enron has generated would make even a Hollywood spin 
doctor envious.
		What's the hubbub?
Although products such as natural gas and energy--Enron's major business 
platform--have been traded as commodities for years, until Enron's appearance 
a formal forward market for steel has never existed. According to McMahon, 
the absence of a liquid and transparent market has resulted in ""uninformed 
investment decisions"" that have exacerbated the current oversupply situation, 
and left companies exposed to the hazards of price volatility. 
		Enron's answer is to offer a variety of financial hedging products along with 
forward contracts in hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized (plate and long 
products are soon to follow), locking in prices for as many as five years 
out. Enron contends that it can act as a ""risk intermediary"" in steel 
transactions, ensuring healthier profit margins and lowering the cost of 
capital. Certain grades of steel are commodities, McMahon insists, and as 
such should be bought and sold on a commodity market basis, instead of the 
strategic relationships that now exist between the mills and consumers. Enron 
has been offering steel online, and via phone and fax, since November of last 
year.
		""Before you add capacity, before you make an investment decision, you'll be 
able to see a three, five, maybe even a 10-year forward price of steel,"" 
McMahon stated, ""and if you want to hedge that investment you can do that.""
		The company plans to buy steel at a floating price and then sell it to steel 
consumers at a fixed rate, making money on the spread. In February, Greg 
Hermans, VP of steel trading at Enron, reported to AMM that it was offering 
U.S.-made 10-gauge, 48-in. wide hot-rolled for April delivery in Chicago for 
$225 a ton. Hermans said Enron was buying the same product for April delivery 
at $215 a ton. 
		Eventually, Enron sees the development of four different marketplaces: the 
Northeast, the Midwest (or Chicago area), the Gulf Coast (or Houston area), 
and the West Coast. Enron will hedge against spot price spikes through equity 
and physical holdings in domestic mills. The company closed on Huntco's 
Arkansas-based cold-rolling mill in June.
		""It's a big portfolio,"" McMahon said. ""We wanted to put together a portfolio 
of supply and demand. In some cases, we'll own assets--hopefully we'll own 
some term contracts with domestic mills. To the extent that imports are a 
part of the equation, we'll be a part of that market. We may purchase 
capacity from somebody, not necessarily the assets, but toll slab through a 
hot strip mill. All of those combined is how we do our business.""
		Steel mills can benefit, McMahon said, by entering into a multi-year 
""physical off take"" with Enron, thus giving steel mills a degree of certain 
volume and on product specification. Enron would guarantee purchase of a 
specified amount of tonnage, and use a floating price or a floor price to 
guard against market shocks. Whether mills would be willing to divert 
capacity to the commodity grades being bought and sold by Enron remains 
uncertain. At least one mill executive privately said no . . . at least for 
now.
		Nucor president, CEO and vice chairman, Dan DiMicco also sees little value in 
Enron's proposal. ""What we need to have is stable pricing at levels where the 
most efficient mills can make a good return on their capital and further 
invest in new technologies and equipment,"" he stated. ""I define true value as 
helping the industry to become stronger. It doesn't do any good to maintain a 
lack of price volatility at $200 a ton.""
		Keith Busse, CEO at Steel Dynamics, echoed that sentiment in a recent New 
Steel article. ""If you're trying to get volatility out at $320 [per ton], 
great,"" he said. ""But at $230, you want to stick your fingers down your 
throat.""
		For the service centers
Service centers, McMahon suggested, could benefit immediately. ""The only way 
[distributors] are able to hedge themselves is to go out and buy inventory,"" 
he explained. ""That takes capital, and cash, and space. We can offer a 
financial product that gives the exact same protection, but doesn't require 
any of the above.
		""We can hold those inventories and price the steel at the time of delivery to 
the service centers,"" he continued, ""so their 4- or 5- percent net margins 
are somewhat certain.""
		""I do think that Enron is providing a service for the industry . . . "" 
commented Dave Lerman, CEO of Steel Warehouse, South Bend, Indiana. But he 
pointed out that ""how [it] moves forward will be interesting. If they just 
move forward with hedge instruments . . . that's independent of whether you 
run your business well by having a good supplier that matches up with the 
demands of your customers. I think [Enron] will be a good thing for some 
people and a non-event for others.""
		Beyond hedging, McMahon pointed out, firm and enforceable contracts could 
become a key benefit to service centers. As one Midwestern distributor source 
commented, ""One of the terrible things that happens in our business is that 
end users demand long-term pricing, beyond what anybody can foresee. When 
they anticipate the market is going up, or that it has hit a low point, they 
push harder for it--as any one would. But historically, they don't honor the 
deals."" 
		In a down market, he explained, customers demand lower prices. Noncompliance 
can result in orders, but no releases, and a ""don't call us, we'll call you"" 
attitude from customers. The consequence for service centers, he said, are 
price reductions on the way down and on the way up. ""If Enron brings 
integrity to both sides of this market,"" he concluded, ""that would be a very 
big plus for the steel industry.""
		But integrity, another Midwest service center exec countered, has got nothing 
to do with it. In his estimation, Enron is like a profiteering carpetbagger, 
""trying to make a buck in between the producer and the user. That's all we 
need right now,"" he declared, ""somebody trying to squeeze out a few more 
dollars."" But, he recognized, ""we're all going to have to deal with it.""
		Don McNeeley, president and CEO of Chicago Tube & Iron, indicated that some 
good could come of a heavy-hitter like Enron introducing new ideas into the 
industry, but acknowledged that people might be offended by somebody picking 
the so-called ""low-hanging fruit"" of the steel market in the current economy. 
""What do you think the mills are going to do when you come to them for just 
the peripheral items?"" he queried. ""My concern would be that the price would 
go up on [those items].""
		McNeeley also questioned the wisdom of distributors relinquishing control of 
their inventories. ""In distribution, 60 percent of our net worth is 
inventory, 30 percent is accounts receivable, and 10 percent is plant 
property and equipment,"" he related. ""Our single largest asset is our 
inventory. If a distribution company surrenders control of its inventory to a 
third party, does not that distributor, in effect, surrender its own 
sovereignty?""
		Only just begun
Questions abound regarding Enron's role as a physical supplier of steel as 
well. As one Minnesota-based service center exec put it, ""are they ready to 
deal with problems?""
		Although Enron has expressed interest in being a physical supplier, Dave 
Lerman explained, ""I think that's going to be a lot more difficult to 
implement."" Enron would have to consider specific qualities, coil sizes, 
nuances of chemistry, surface quality, and formability. ""Most customers 
require better than standard tolerances,"" he pointed out. ""These are all 
issues that might complicate commodity sales.""
		Delivery is another issue. As a physical supplier, Enron has virtually 
guaranteed just-in-time delivery, but as one service center source said, ""the 
guarantee is good when the material shows up at my door. What happens if it 
doesn't show up? I disappoint a customer. What good does it do to sue [Enron] 
if I've lost a customer?""
		Mill executives have questioned whether Enron is a potential competitor. 
""They see Enron as someone likely to buy foreign steel in order to deliver it 
to a U.S. customer,"" said Chuck Bradford, principal of Bradford Research and 
a long-time industry observer. He cautioned against seeing Enron as too much 
of a physical supplier, speculating that the future of Enron, similar to the 
LME, will be in hedging. ""You may see some [physical transactions] to start 
with,"" Bradford predicted, ""just to get the ball rolling. But I don't see 
that as the way the market will develop.""
		McMahon has been consistent in saying that Enron has little interest in 
becoming a steel manufacturer. The real value, he said, is in a transparent, 
liquid market. ""We know the products work, we know the market wants them. Can 
any one particular mill or mills prevent that? We don't think so,"" he said. 
""It's not an 'if', it's a 'when'.""
		The jury is still out on just how soon that ""when"" will come, and what those 
effects will be for the steel industry. And for all of the debate surrounding 
the issue, it seems a bit soon to be hitting the panic button. As Don 
McNeeley recounted, ""I can recall similar controversy over a speech a guy 
gave about 15-17 years ago. That guy's name was Ken Iverson, and he had this 
concept called a mini-mill. Look at it now.""

I think the presentation looks good.  In the meeting itself I think you 
should go heavy on the argument that it makes no sense for Sempra

Jeff and the Governor to talk (because of the Governor's schedule).  We'll 
try to set something up later.  In the meantime, the Governor should just 
sign the bill.  Of course, Hettie had already communicated this; the Gov's 
office acknowledged that the message was recieved but did not make a specific

I attended Cmmr. Wood's two-day hearing on Wholesale Markets, which concluded 
today (8/24) in San Diego.  Three Commissioner's were present (Wood, Lynch 
and Neeper) with Duque and Bilas participating by phone.  Administrative Law 
Judge Wetzel was present and a transcript was taken.  The quasi-legislative 
hearing was the beginning of a record developed for the investigation into 
the workings of wholesale/retail markets.  This session focused on Wholesale 
markets.  There will be subsequent sessions on retail issues, market 
structure and other related issues in the future.  My conclusion from this 
session is that Wood is looking for support for increasing regulatory 
intervention in the market.

Dan Larcamp, Director of the Office of markets, Tariffs and Rates, FERC, was 
present.  He relayed FERC's concern of this matter and a desire to hold 
hearings in San Diego.  He also relayed that Hoecker held a press conference 
announcing the opening of a 206 investigative proceeding into the operation 
of the wholesale markets in California, which carried with it refund 
authority.

The format of the hearing was to respond to pre-filed questions developed by 
Wood/Lynch.  Each member of the panel would respond to the questions and any 
questions posed by the Commissioners, the Judge or the CPUC Attorney.  No 
questions were posed by members of the audience.  Yesterday's panel of 
academics were comprised of:

1.  Dr. Timothy Duane-UC Berkley
2.  Dr. William Hogan-Harvard
3.  Dr. Frank Wolak-Stanford (ISO Market Surveillance Committee)
4.  David Marcus-Energy Consultant for the Coaltion of Utility Employees
5.  Dr. Gene Coyle
6.  Dr. Jean-Michel Glachant, Universite Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne

The panel was asked to speak as individuals and not on behalf of any 
institutions they may represent.  While the purpose of the panel seemed to be 
to determine that market power was being exercised and that prices were too 
high and therefore not just and reasonable, the panelist stopped short of 
blaming generators and market participants in behaving illegally.  The 
concensus generally was that market power did exist at various times, but the 
mere existence did not constitute bad behavior.  None, with the exception of 
Dr. Wolak who is in the process of doing a study using recent data as part of 
his role for the Market Surveillance Committee, had done a study.  There was 
some discussion, though not much, of the monopsony power of the utilities.  I 
think ultimately the group conceded that scarcity of supply amplified 
concerns about the exercise of market power, as even the increase in gas 
costs did not fully explain the recent spikes.  Wolak believes that encourage 
utilities to enter into forward purchases will reduce the exercise of 
real-time market power. 

Hogan seemed to be there with Sempra's interests in mind.  He continued to 
promote expansion of the ISO's abilities to dispatch load as well as maintain 
system reliability.  There was alot of discussion about forward purchase 
ability for utilities so as to be less subject to volatile market prices.  
The concerns were also discussed about the appropriateness of a distribution 
utility making purchasing decisions on behalf of its customers.  This 
included discussion of separation of these functions and the default provider 
role.  

Most everyone agreed that rolling back to a regulated market was not feasible 
without raising other major and serious concerns, however there seemed to be 
support for some interim measures where cost-of-service regulation may be a 
good idea and that was during peak periods.  All agreed that a demand 
response, and price signals, are important in the long-run, although not to 
the extent currently experienced in San Diego.

Today's panel included representatives from SDG&E, SCE and PG&E, TURN, UCAN 
and ORA.  

While yesterday's panel maintained objectivity as to whether or not 
generators were exercising market power to the detriment of the system, 
today's panel made no bones about the generators being to blame.

SCE/PG&E indicated their need for relief for recovery of market costs in 
excess of the rate freeze.  SDG&E was still on the hot seat for their 
inaction in hedging any of their supply.  SDG&E brought up their failed PBR 
proposal and ORA and UCAN thought that that may be one way to incent the 
utility to be more responsible with their purchases.

UCAN discussed the Governor's direction and the potential for putting rate 
caps into affect for residential and small commercial.  He mentioned that C&I 
customers are experience difficulties as well.  

TURN raised the need for cost-based bid caps and cost-based peaking 
contracts.  Mike Florio, TURN, urged against any further divestitute of 
assets and alleged market concentration on those assets that had been 
divested.  In fact, TURN urged the Commission to seek legislation to clarify 
the Commission's authority to order retention of assets.

Neeper urged that part of the solution should be changing the current 
requirement to use the PX as the only authorized exchange, although TURN 
disagreed.

Subject: Daily Update/ Legislative activity - 08/24/00

Siting related bills

1. Good new - The Williamson Act passed the Senate 34-1, It should be heard 
at the assembly Saturday or Monday if it is not redirected to a Committee 
hearing.

2. There was a long meeting with Ducheny with regards to AB 970. The enviro's 
boycotted, they want to draft a bill with Keeley. Labor was obstructionist - 
they wanted to gut all the expediting siting  language with regards to all 
facilities except for the peaking plants.  

Rate Cap related bills
1. The Edison Language on Rate Stabilization may not go anywhere. Edison has 
not found an author because of the efforts of Enron and others lobbying 
against it. Furthermore there are signs that Gov. Davis opposes it.

2. The Governor's office has issued a proposed language for a rate cap bill. 
The language however is not available as of yet. It may be released today or 
tomorrow. SDG&E has shown concerns over the content of the bill. They seem to 
think that it is worse than initially proposed by the Governor in his press 
release. 
The bill includes retroactive rate caps through 6/1/00. 
The rate cap could reflect Wood's rate cap proposal (6.5 cts cap on the 
energy component
The bill does not specify who or how the costs associated with the cap will 
be recovered. (The reasoning is that UDCs will be more cautious in their 
procurement if there is uncertainty on who is responsible for the costs.)
All of this is speculative. We hope to see the actual language soon.

3. Enron has been working with the Republican leadership to promote a rate 
cap proposal similar to the amended language we have proposed for AB2290.
The bill focuses only on SDG&E customers and our major principals are the 
following. 
The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to residential and small commercial 
customers, plus specific institutions that have a significant public role, 
such as schools and hospitals.  
The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to the period ending December 31, 2001.
The Interim Rate Cap must be structured so that any undercollection is 
eventually recovered from the same customers who benefit from the lower rates 
provided by the rate cap.

Steve, 

Sorry for the delay in tracking down this rumor on a potential ad campaign.
I left a message with Maureen this afternoon and subsequently talked with
Smith's staff person.  She said she was not aware of any ad campaign but she
would talk with the Senator about it when he is back on Monday. 

Have a good weekend and I will call you on Monday.

Sue --

Just checking to see if there is any new word from IEP on the draft Feinstein legislation you had sent earlier.  I have quietly alerted others in town -- such as EPSA and INGAA.  NGSA -- the group that represents the natural gas producers -- is aware and sending comments to her this week.  We have heard conflicting reports about whether she still intends to pursue the legislation -- at least on a stand alone basis -- and how much of a priority should will place on it in relation to other energy issues.  I intend to call her energy staffer next week to sit down before the Senate Energy Committee resumes votes in September.  Any news on this issue would be helpful.  Thanks in advance.

Jim forwarded your e-mail on the Feinstein legislation (draft).  While she has talked about her interests conceptually in various hearings and meetings, we have not yet seen draft legislative language or more details.  If you have draft language or more details (which it sounded like from your e-mail), please forward and we can discuss.  Thanks for your assistance.

I assume you're all over this, Linda.

On the off chance that you haven't seen it.  Feinstein is asking IEP for comments on her draft legislation that would increase regulation of natural gas, define what just and reasonable rates would be and increase refund power on the electric side.  I think we would have some concerns with her proposal.  If you want to pass along our comments to IEP, just get them to me.","FW: Feinstein Legislation.

Steve, Jim, Mike:

You may be aware that Enron officials have in the past met with international 
opinion leaders visiting the US as part of the Eisenhower Exchange Fellowship 
(EEF) program. The EEF is an international leadership exchange program that 
promotes international understanding and productivity through the exchange of 
information, ideas, and perspectives among emerging leaders throughout the 
world. Ken Lay is a member of the EEF Board of Trustees.

Enron will be hosting three EEF visitors from India on Wednesday, October 18, 
2000:

Mr. Sanjeev Ahluwalia, Secretary of the Central Electricity Regulatory 
Commission; 
Mr. Sreenivasan Jain, Newscaster, New Delhi TV; and 
Mr. Jawed Usmani, Joint Secretary, Office of the Prime Minister.

I am preparing a day program at Enron for the three persons, two of whom -  
Sanjeev Ahluwalia and Jawed Usmani - are interested in learning more about 
the US regulatory environment. Mr. Ahluwalia also wants to learn more about 
US environmental policy in both local and global contexts (please refer to 
attached bios for more details).

I would be grateful if either Steve or Jim could meet with the above persons 
for 30-45 minutes to discuss regulatory issues. Similarly, if Mike could be 
available to meet with Mr. Ahluwalia re environmental issues. Please let me 
know if you are available either between 10:00 - 12:00 noon or 3:30 - 5:00 
p.m. on Wednesday, October 18, 2000. If you are unavailable, it would be 
appreciated if one of your other colleagues could assist in this regard.

Many thanks,

California Adopts Variable Pricing, Raising Ire of Generators, Traders
By Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

10/30/2000
The Wall Street Journal
A4
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -- In the latest attempt to fix California's troubled deregulated 
energy market, officials adopted a unique variable-pricing plan that already 
is being criticized by power generators and traders as unworkable and praised 
by utilities and consumers as much needed protection against gouging. 
Under the plan, adopted late last week by the governing board of the 
California Independent System Operator, or ISO, a quasipublic agency 
responsible for maintaining electricity reliability in the state, the cap on 
wholesale power will be reset hourly from about $65 per megawatt hour at 
low-demand times to no more than $250 an hour at periods of high demand. It 
was the third time this year that officials effectively lowered the price cap 
on wholesale electricity in a bid to contain -- so far unsuccessfully -- 
soaring total power costs.
The move underscores the chaotic atmosphere prevailing in California's power 
market after a two-year-old experiment in deregulation has come undone. In 
other deregulated markets such as New York and New England, prices are capped 
at $1000 per megawatt hour, which are intended to be low enough to prevent 
market abuse but high enough to give generators incentive to build new 
plants. California's system was supposed to work the same way. But because 
utilities in California divested themselves of the bulk of their plants but 
weren't allowed to lock in fixed-price supply contracts, unlike in the other 
markets, merchant generators have had much greater sway over prices here on 
the spot market, where most power trades. 
During the first nine months of the year, the average price of wholesale 
electricity was $90 per megawatt hour in California, triple the price of a 
year earlier. Even on cool days in October, the price generally has remained 
above $100 per megawatt hour. California utilities have lost money on those 
power purchases because their customers' rates are frozen at $54 to $65 per 
megawatt hour, far lower than the average price utilities have had to pay for 
that power. The deficits exceeded $5 billion in the June-to-September period. 
California utilities buy the power used by their customers from the 
state-sanctioned auctions administered by the ISO and a sister organization, 
the California Power Exchange. In New York and New England, by comparison, 
less than 20% of power is purchased from the spot markets because utilities 
there were able to sign the fixed-price contracts, which California utilities 
weren't allowed to do. The price-cap decision passed last week by a vote of 
13 to 10, primarily with support from utilities and board members 
representing consumer interests. It was pushed aggressively by Pacific Gas & 
Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, the state's two big 
investor-owned utilities that have gotten caught in the price-spike vise this 
year. 
Some ISO members say they had no choice but to support the measure to ratchet 
down price caps. ""We're going after the windfall profits,"" said S. David 
Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, 
who voted for the measure. ""What we've got now is a market accustomed to 
ripping off the consumer. This can't be allowed to go on."" 
But other experts said the hasty measure may make California's problems even 
worse. ""The short-term regulatory fix is always to fix prices,"" said Pam 
Prairie, director of the Institute of Public Utilities at Michigan State 
University in East Lansing. ""But there's a real danger you'll set prices too 
low and make your supply problems even worse."" 
Other economists agreed. ""At best, this is poorly administered cost-based 
regulation,"" said Frank Wolak, an economics professor at Stanford University 
who sits on an independent market-monitoring committee at the ISO. ""At worst, 
it creates all sorts of perverse market incentives."" 
For example, it may increase the problem of ""megawatt laundering"" on hot days 
in which in-state generators sell power to out-of-state customers who then 
sell it back into the state, effectively bypassing the cap. Likewise, it 
could encourage generators to build new plants outside of California, rather 
than where they are needed near its major cities, also to avoid the cap. In 
the end, it could increase stresses to the state's already overburdened 
transmission system. 
In fact, the decision already has brought to a halt the state's forward 
electricity market, which allows wholesale customers to sign contracts for 
power they will use in the future. The market had been trading as much as 
1,000 contracts a week. On Friday, there was practically no activity. 
""This decision shows the height of lunacy,"" said Rick Shapiro, a managing 
director at Enron Corp., the giant Houston-based energy trader. Mr. Shapiro 
said Enron and other generators will file appeals at the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission asking that the new pricing formula be rescinded. 
It is possible the FERC may throw out the pricing formula anyway. It is 
expected to issue a major order on Nov. 1 directing changes in California's 
market structure. That order will include its determination of the 
effectiveness of price caps. It also is expected to judge the merits of the 
governance structure at the ISO, which has lately been marked by infighting. 
Recently, consumer groups have charged that the ISO board has put the 
business interests of its members ahead of members' fiduciary duty to 
California residents. 
The most recent price-cap measure was approved over the objections of 
executives at the ISO whose job it will be to implement the formula. ISO 
Chief Executive Terry Winter said the measure is flawed because it doesn't 
take into account the amount of power available to the California market. Mr. 
Winter fears the caps will place the state at a disadvantage relative to 
neighboring states with no price caps. About 11 states are electrically 
interconnected in the West, meaning power can be moved between them and chase 
the highest prices. 
""We keep getting accused of making our market too complicated,"" Mr. Winter 
said. ""Then along comes this proposal"" with caps that would adjust repeatedly 
throughout the day, depending on demand.

Enron Offers Cash To Help Azurix Take Itself Private
By Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

10/30/2000
The Wall Street Journal
A12
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp. offered to lend Azurix Corp., an Enron spinoff, $275 million so 
that it could take itself private. 
Enron, which has been frustrated with the global water company's performance, 
suggested Friday that public shareholders receive a cash offer of $7 a share 
for their Azurix stock. While nearly double the stock's value prior to the 
offer, the suggested price nevertheless was far below the $19 at which Azurix 
made its debut in 1999.
An Azurix spokeswoman said the board, on which Enron has seats, had not yet 
decided how to treat the Enron offer. An Enron spokesman said that taking the 
company private would ""give us more opportunity to directly affect our 
investment."" In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, 
Azurix soared $3 to $6.56 in heavy trading. 
Azurix had hoped to create a splash by doing to the water business what Enron 
had done to the energy business -- increase competition and provide trading 
skills capable of creating new financial products out of old commodities. But 
Azurix stumbled, nearly from the outset. Deregulation of the water business 
and government privatizations of water systems, on which it was counting, 
were slow to come, crimping growth opportunities and profit. And Enron, 
accustomed to higher, faster returns, grew impatient with the 
capital-intensive water business. 
The company's first chief executive, Rebecca Mark, a onetime head of Enron's 
international division, resigned in the summer with the agreement of Enron 
executives, who said it was time for new leadership. The incoming chief 
executive, John Garrison, said he would look for buyers for some of the 
company's businesses; he was unavailable to comment Friday. Ms. Mark was 
believed to be considering making an offer for some of those businesses, 
herself. She declined a request for an interview. 
In its letter to Azurix officers, Enron said the water company received four 
offers from prospective suitors after Ms. Mark's departure, the best of which 
came from an unidentified bidder who offered $7 a share and went through a 
lengthy due-diligence process before backing down, apparently spooked by 
Azurix's cash flow, capital structure, tax considerations and some securities 
litigation. 
In its proposal letter, made public Friday, Enron said it concluded ""that 
there is no other buyer willing to pay the $7"" and so proceeded with its own 
offer. But Enron said it won't try to limit Azurix's ability to negotiate a 
better deal with others, should they come forward. Finally, Enron noted that 
Azurix had considered various partial or full-liquidation alternatives but 
said they didn't seem likely to produce more than $7 a share.

Wessex switch likely

Wessex Water's American parent company is likely to be taken private after a 
disastrous 14-month spell as a quoted company. 
Wessex, which provides water services to the South of England, was bought by 
Azurix in 1998 for Pounds 1.6 billion. Azurix wanted to use Wessex's 
expertise in privatised water supply to build a global business. However, 
since listing at $19 a share in June last year, Azurix stock has gone into 
freefall, closing at less than $4 earlier this week. Azurix slumped because 
it drastically misjudged the number of privatisation opportunities.
It emerged last night that Enron, the Texan energy and trading company that 
is Azurix's biggest shareholder, has taken the unusual step of offering to 
lend Azurix $275 million (Pounds 190 million) to buy its publicly held 
shares, thereby taking it private. 
The Enron proposal would value Azurix at about $800 million or $7 per share - 
63 per cent less than the IPO price. Enron would control Azurix and Wessex 
Water if it went private.

$275 million so Azurix can go private by purchasing 38.6 million shares that 
are publicly traded. 
The deal would have Azurix buying back its stock at $7 per share, about 
double what the shares were trading for Thursday. That's a big comedown for 
Azurix shares, which sold for $19 each when the Houston company went public 
in June 1999.
The maneuver technically can be called a ""take-under,"" said analyst Carol 
Coale of Prudential Securities in Houston. She also described it as Enron's 
least painful solution for what to do with the venture that never lived up 
its ambitious plans. 
""Nothing about Azurix has been positive for Enron, in my view,"" said Coale. 
""This is a solution to a problem."" 
Azurix spokeswoman Diane Bazelides said its board is studying Enron's 
proposal. She added that it was too early to comment on the offer because the 
proposal's structure had not been outlined. 
Enron imposed no deadline for a decision by Azurix, but reserved the right to 
withdraw the offer if Azurix's position with prospective customers and 
employees deteriorated. 
One of Enron's conditions is that Azurix not sell any major assets before the 
buyout. 
The deal would not change Enron's large stake in Azurix, said Palmer. It owns 
a third, while the other third is owned by the Atlantic Water Trust, in which 
Enron owns a 50 percent voting interest. 
The proposal's advantages include giving public shareholders a premium to the 
market price, said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. 
The common stock of Azurix zoomed Friday on the news, gaining $3 to close at 
$6.56 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Becoming a private company would give Azurix management greater flexibility 
in restructuring. Coale said it would reduce Azurix's general and 
administrative costs, helping it to bid against lower- cost foreign 
competition, particularly two big French companies. Azurix's high cost 
structure has been its primary problem, she said. 
Azurix has been looking at cost and strategies ever since it got a new 
president and chief executive on Aug. 25, said Bazelides. That was the date 
that Rebecca Mark resigned as Azurix's high-profile chairman and chief 
executive. 
Enron and Azurix have been looking at ""strategic alternatives"" for nine 
months, J. Mark Meets, Enron's executive vice president for corporate 
development, said in a letter filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
One alternative was selling the company, he said. 
That didn't work out because the offers from three companies didn't exceed $4 
per share. 
The fourth potential buyer said it would consider offering $7 per share, said 
Meets. But that suitor backed out, citing reasons like cash flow, complexity 
of the capital structure, tax considerations and pending securities 
litigation. 
""We are obviously quite disappointed by this most recent turn of events,"" 
Meets said in the letter. ""However, we strongly believe that there is no 
other buyer willing to pay the $7 per share initially proposed (but later 
withdrawn) by the fourth bidder.""

Quietly, Bush's team talks about transition; Plenty of folks in Austin would 
love to follow Bush to D.C.
Ken Herman American-Statesman Capitol Bureau Chief

10/28/2000
Austin American-Statesman

(Copyright 2000)

Not long ago, at a glossy wooden table in a Texas Capitol office, two of Gov. 
George W. Bush's high-level appointees discussed one of the key issues in 
state government these days. It involved the relative merits of White House 
posts that could be available to the two appointees if Bush becomes 
president. 
Asked this week whether it's a common topic around the Capitol, one of the 
appointees gestured to the anteroom of his office and made a motion 
indicating that even the midlevel folks have Washington on their minds.
Near the banks of the Colorado, Potomac Fever is a near-epidemic. 
And though it is political faux pas to be too open about doing White House 
transition planning before Election Day, be assured it is going on at Bush 
headquarters, where top officials are cognizant of the fine line between 
looking too confident now and looking too unprepared later. 
The candidate himself -- as well as his top aides -- steers clear of 
transition talk. When asked who might wind up in his Cabinet, Bush looks 
backward instead of forward, saying that his selection of Dick Cheney as his 
running mate should offer a glimpse of the kind of people who would wind up 
in his administration. 
The transition work, such that it is, is under the aegis of longtime Bush 
friend and aide Clay Johnson, who began as head of the gubernatorial 
appointments office and now serves as chief of staff. Johnson said nobody has 
been interviewed for any Washington post, but he has compiled a file of folks 
who are interested in serving in a Bush administration. 
Johnson also has been reading up on previous transitions -- ones that went 
well and ones that didn't. His preliminary conclusion is that the outgoing 
administrations are generally helpful and supportive, even if they were 
ousted by the incoming administration. It's the incoming administrations that 
can make the mistakes, he said. 
There is no shortage of think tanks that have think-tanked the topic. Back in 
August, the Heritage Foundation, based in Washington, issued a transition 
handbook titled ""The Keys to a Successful Presidency."" 
""Though we really don't expect either campaign to talk about it (and would 
discourage them from doing so), the message here is it's time to start 
planning for a possible presidential transition, quietly, well behind the 
scenes, but with the understanding that the preparation done during the next 
70 or so days, and the work done in the 70 or so days that follow (between 
the election and the inauguration) will very well determine the initial 
success or failure of the next administration,"" Herbert Berkowitz, a 
foundation vice president, said in releasing the study. 
All indications are that the Bush team has been following the advice, with 
Johnson at the helm. 
Johnson cautions against expectations that a Bush administration would be 
overloaded with Texans. 
""It's the United States of America, not the United States of Texas,"" he said. 
Despite that caveat, there is no shortage of Texans who are considered 
shoo-ins to fill some of the thousands of slots Bush could offer if he wins. 
Johnson confirms that he is very interested in a Washington job. Early 
speculation among Bush aides makes Johnson a potential leading contender for 
head of personnel at the White House. 
Karen Hughes, Bush's communications director since his 1994 gubernatorial 
campaign, is expected to become Bush's press secretary if he wins the White 
House. Karl Rove, Bush's longtime political guru, also will be on board, 
though he could wind up with an out-of- the-White-House post, perhaps at the 
Republican National Committee. 
Not as certain is the potential future for Joe Allbaugh, who is part of the 
""iron triangle"" of top advisers -- along with Rove and Hughes -- who have 
been on board with Bush since the 1994 campaign. Allbaugh serves as manager 
of the presidential campaign and previously served as chief of staff in the 
governor's office. 
Capitol speculation indicates Allbaugh could decide to skip a White House 
post, possibly in favor of a lobbying job, if he is not tapped as chief of 
staff. That post could go to Don Evans, a longtime Bush friend who headed the 
megasuccessful fund-raising effort for the presidential campaign. 
However, not everyone has Potomac Fever. For example, Terral Smith, Bush's 
legislative director, said he will stay in Austin to lobby. 
In addition to the speculation about appointees, the approaching election has 
sparked talk about when Bush might leave office if he wins. Under the U.S. 
Constitution, he could remain governor until he has to become president on 
Jan. 20. 
Much more likely, however, is that Bush would leave office sooner than that, 
perhaps as soon as two or three weeks after the Nov. 7 election, if he wins. 
That could cause a housing problem for Bush, whose main residence is the 
Governor's Mansion, which comes as a free perk of the job. The Bushes have a 
home under construction at their ranch in Crawford, near Waco. The ranch also 
has a smaller house in which the Bushes now spend weekends. 
Not out of the question is that Bush could work out an arrangement with Lt. 
Gov. Rick Perry, who would become governor if Bush resigns, to remain in the 
Governor's Mansion for several weeks after he leaves office. 
If the race among Texas senators to replace Perry as lieutenant governor 
complicates the timing of the resignation, Bush could stay in the governor's 
office a little longer, but no later than the first week of January. After 
all, he will want to give Perry time to bask in his gubernatorial 
inauguration before the Legislature convenes Jan. 9. 
No matter when Bush resigns, confidantes believe he might use his Crawford 
ranch for interviews with potential top-level appointees, including Cabinet 
members.

Dynegy: Calif Price Caps Will Compromise Elec Reliability

10/27/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A Dynegy executive said Friday that the California 
Independent System Operator's plan to impose hourly price caps on the 
wholesale power market will compromise reliability by forcing generators to 
sell electricity out of state.
""If the ISO says it will not buy above a certain price and generators cannot 
operate below that price, then we have no choice but to find other markets to 
participate in,"" said Dynegy senior vice president of marketing and trading 
asset management Lynn Lednicky. ""That may lead to the ISO not finding the 
power it needs at a price it wants to pay."" 
The ISO plans to construct hourly price caps each month based on forecast 
load, natural gas prices and generation unit efficiency. The caps will take 
effect Nov. 3 or soon therafter. 
Dynegy Inc. (DYN) sent a letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
asking it to address reliability consequences of the price caps before Nov. 
3. Dynegy specifically requested that FERC discuss the issue at its Nov. 1 
meeting, when it will release a report on California's electricity problems. 
Enron Corp. (ENE) and Southern Company (SO) share Dynegy's concerns about 
reliability and plan to petition FERC about the issue, said a trader 
listening in to a conference call between the three companies.

SEC Filing Shows 3rd Parties Contacted Enron About Azurix
By Christopher C. Williams

10/27/2000
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

New York -(Dow Jones)- Shares of Azurix Corp. (AZX) jumped 84% in heavy 
trading Friday after parent Enron Corp. (ENE) proposed to take the company 
private in a $7-a-share buyout.
Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that Enron made 
the proposal after not being satisfied with offers it had received from four 
third parties for its stake in Azurix. 
In a letter to two members of Azurix's board, Enron said three potential 
buyers ""were unlikely to be willing to pay more than the then-current market 
price of approximately $4 a share."" 
Enron said a fourth potential buyer indicated it would consider a $7-a-share 
offer, but it said that proposal was recently withdrawn. ""The reasons given 
by the bidder included pro forma cash flows, the complexity of the capital 
structure, tax considerations and the currently pending securities 
litigation,"" the letter said. 
Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Houston-based Enron, declined to say whether 
Enron was entertaining current third-party interests or was in any talks with 
other parties regarding its Azurix stake. 
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Azurix ended Friday up $3 to 
$6.56 on 2.8 million shares, compared with average daily volume of 239,000 
shares. Enron was up $1.38, or 1.8%, to $78.88 on 1.6 million shares, 
compared with its daily average turnover of 2.4 million. 
In the SEC filing, Enron, saying it's familiar with Azurix's various partial 
and full liquidation alternatives, said its buyout proposal is conditioned 
upon Azurix not selling any significant assets prior to the buyout. 
""Although we agree that such plans may result in greater value to Azurix's 
shareholders than the maintenance of the status quo, we believe that these 
options almost certainly will not result on a present value in a greater 
return to Azurix's shareholders than $7 a share,"" the letter said. 
Enron also said its buyout proposal doesn't include any breakup fees or other 
""deal protection devices."" This frees Azurix's board to pursue an acquisition 
that ""might provide greater value"" to shareholders. 
Daine Bazelides, a spokeswoman for Azurix, declined to say whether Azurix is 
now entertaining offers for the company. She did, however, confirm the 
information contained in Enron's filing. ""The historical information in the 
filing is factually correct,"" she told Dow Jones Newswires. 
She said she doesn't know when Azurix board will respond to Enron's proposal. 
In the filing, Enron didn't set a deadline, but warned that Azurix's position 
with customers and employees may deteriorate further. ""We must therefore 
reserve the right to withdraw our proposal at any time,"" Enron's letter said. 
In the letter, Enron pointed out that Azurix had retained two 
""internationally recognized investment bankers"" early this year to evaluate 
strategic alternatives, which included the potential sale of the company to 
unrelated third parties. 
Enron said it strongly believes there isn't another buyer willing to pay $7 a 
share for Enron's indirect interest in Azurix. ""We believe it is in Azurix's 
best interest, as well as the best interest of its shareholders and 
employees, if Azurix were no longer a publicly traded company,"" Enron said.

Enron offers to buy out Azurix
Financial Times
By Hillary Durgin in Houston
Published: October 27 2000 23:31GMT | Last Updated: October 27 2000 23:36GMT


Enron, the Houston-based energy and trading group, said on Friday it had 
offered up to $275m in funding to take Azurix private at a buy-out price of 
$7 per share. 
The specific structure of Enron's proposal has yet to be determined, Enron 
said. Azurix said its board would now consider the proposal. The timing of 
any decision was unclear. 
Enron owns directly and indirectly about 66 per cent of Azurix, the troubled 
Houston water company, whose main asset is UK-based Wessex Water. 
The buyout offer is the latest development in a history of problems at 
Azurix, which was spun off from Enron and taken public at an offering price 
of $19 per share. 
But a combination of poor market timing, competitive industry conditions and 
empty promises by the company on Wall Street took their toll on the company, 
whose shares have since plummeted and have been trading most recently around 
the $3-per-share range. In August, Rebecca Mark, Azurix chief executive 
officer, resigned both from Azurix and from the board at Enron. 
Enron's offer came after four unnamed parties approached Enron about buying 
its stake in Azurix. 
While three of the four were unwilling to pay more than the then market price 
of about $4 per share, a fourth party who was considering offering $7 per 
share (before accounting for any dilution for stock options) later declined 
to pursue the transaction, Enron said in Friday's letter to Azurix, outlining 
the buyout proposal. 
""We strongly believe that our proposal is fair to Azurix's public 
stockholders,"" the letter stated. ""Our proposed transaction would permit 
Azurix's stockholders to receive, on a timely basis, a cash payment for their 
shares that is significantly above the price at which those shares have 
traded in several months."" 
Analysts that follow Azurix and had valued the shares at between $6 and $8 
per shares said the offer was fair. Analysts that follow Enron said that 
Azurix's business strategy had proved to be a failure and was characteristic 
of the hard asset approach that Enron has gradually distanced itself from. 
Enron's shares closed at $78.88 up $1.38 on Friday. Azurix's shares rose $3 
to close at $6.56.

LOS ANGELES -- In the latest attempt to fix California's troubled deregulated energy market, officials adopted a unique variable-pricing plan that already is being criticized by power generators and traders as unworkable and praised by utilities and consumers as much needed protection against gouging. Under the plan, adopted late last week by the governing board of the California Independent System Operator, or ISO, a quasipublic agency responsible for maintaining electricity reliability in the state, the cap on wholesale power will be reset hourly from about $65 per megawatt hour at low-demand times to no more than $250 an hour at periods of high demand. It was the third time this year that officials effectively lowered the price cap on wholesale electricity in a bid to contain -- so far unsuccessfully -- soaring total power costs. The move underscores the chaotic atmosphere prevailing in California's power market after a two-year-old experiment in deregulation has come undone. In other deregulated markets such as New York and New England, prices are capped at $1000 per megawatt hour, which are intended to be low enough to prevent market abuse but high enough to give generators incentive to build new plants. California's system was supposed to work the same way. But because utilities in California divested themselves of the bulk of their plants but weren't allowed to lock in fixed-price supply contracts, unlike in the other markets, merchant generators have had much greater sway over prices here on the spot market, where most power trades. During the first nine months of the year, the average price of wholesale electricity was $90 per megawatt hour in California, triple the price of a year earlier. Even on cool days in October, the price generally has remained above $100 per megawatt hour. California utilities have lost money on those power purchases because their customers' rates are frozen at $54 to $65 per megawatt hour, far lower than the average price utilities have had to pay for that power. The deficits exceeded $5 billion in the June-to-September period. California utilities buy the power used by their customers from the state-sanctioned auctions administered by the ISO and a sister organization, the California Power Exchange. In New York and New England, by comparison, less than 20% of power is purchased from the spot markets because utilities there were able to sign the fixed-price contracts, which California utilities weren't allowed to do. The price-cap decision passed last week by a vote of 13 to 10, primarily with support from utilities and board members representing consumer interests. It was pushed aggressively by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, the state's two big investor-owned utilities that have gotten caught in the price-spike vise this year. Some ISO members say they had no choice but to support the measure to ratchet down price caps. ""We're going after the windfall profits,"" said S. David Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, who voted for the measure. ""What we've got now is a market accustomed to ripping off the consumer. This can't be allowed to go on."" But other experts said the hasty measure may make California's problems even worse. ""The short-term regulatory fix is always to fix prices,"" said Pam Prairie, director of the Institute of Public Utilities at Michigan State University in East Lansing. ""But there's a real danger you'll set prices too low and make your supply problems even worse."" Other economists agreed. ""At best, this is poorly administered cost-based regulation,"" said Frank Wolak, an economics professor at Stanford University who sits on an independent market-monitoring committee at the ISO. ""At worst, it creates all sorts of perverse market incentives."" For example, it may increase the problem of ""megawatt laundering"" on hot days in which in-state generators sell power to out-of-state customers who then sell it back into the state, effectively bypassing the cap. Likewise, it could encourage generators to build new plants outside of California, rather than where they are needed near its major cities, also to avoid the cap. In the end, it could increase stresses to the state's already overburdened transmission system. In fact, the decision already has brought to a halt the state's forward electricity market, which allows wholesale customers to sign contracts for power they will use in the future. The market had been trading as much as 1,000 contracts a week. On Friday, there was practically no activity. ""This decision shows the height of lunacy,"" said Rick Shapiro, a managing director at Enron Corp., the giant Houston-based energy trader. Mr. Shapiro said Enron and other generators will file appeals at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission asking that the new pricing formula be rescinded. It is possible the FERC may throw out the pricing formula anyway. It is expected to issue a major order on Nov. 1 directing changes in California's market structure. That order will include its determination of the effectiveness of price caps. It also is expected to judge the merits of the governance structure at the ISO, which has lately been marked by infighting. Recently, consumer groups have charged that the ISO board has put the business interests of its members ahead of members' fiduciary duty to California residents. The most recent price-cap measure was approved over the objections of executives at the ISO whose job it will be to implement the formula. ISO Chief Executive Terry Winter said the measure is flawed because it doesn't take into account the amount of power available to the California market. Mr. Winter fears the caps will place the state at a disadvantage relative to neighboring states with no price caps. About 11 states are electrically interconnected in the West, meaning power can be moved between them and chase the highest prices. ""We keep getting accused of making our market too complicated,"" Mr. Winter said. ""Then along comes this proposal"" with caps that would adjust repeatedly throughout the day, depending on demand.

Enron Offers Cash To Help Azurix Take Itself Private By Rebecca Smith Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/30/2000 The Wall Street Journal A12 (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) Enron Corp. offered to lend Azurix Corp., an Enron spinoff, $275 million so that it could take itself private. Enron, which has been frustrated with the global water company's performance, suggested Friday that public shareholders receive a cash offer of $7 a share for their Azurix stock. While nearly double the stock's value prior to the offer, the suggested price nevertheless was far below the $19 at which Azurix made its debut in 1999. An Azurix spokeswoman said the board, on which Enron has seats, had not yet decided how to treat the Enron offer. An Enron spokesman said that taking the company private would ""give us more opportunity to directly affect our investment."" In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Azurix soared $3 to $6.56 in heavy trading. Azurix had hoped to create a splash by doing to the water business what Enron had done to the energy business -- increase competition and provide trading skills capable of creating new financial products out of old commodities. But Azurix stumbled, nearly from the outset. Deregulation of the water business and government privatizations of water systems, on which it was counting, were slow to come, crimping growth opportunities and profit. And Enron, accustomed to higher, faster returns, grew impatient with the capital-intensive water business. The company's first chief executive, Rebecca Mark, a onetime head of Enron's international division, resigned in the summer with the agreement of Enron executives, who said it was time for new leadership. The incoming chief executive, John Garrison, said he would look for buyers for some of the company's businesses; he was unavailable to comment Friday. Ms. Mark was believed to be considering making an offer for some of those businesses, herself. She declined a request for an interview. In its letter to Azurix officers, Enron said the water company received four offers from prospective suitors after Ms. Mark's departure, the best of which came from an unidentified bidder who offered $7 a share and went through a lengthy due-diligence process before backing down, apparently spooked by Azurix's cash flow, capital structure, tax considerations and some securities litigation. In its proposal letter, made public Friday, Enron said it concluded ""that there is no other buyer willing to pay the $7"" and so proceeded with its own offer. But Enron said it won't try to limit Azurix's ability to negotiate a better deal with others, should they come forward. Finally, Enron noted that Azurix had considered various partial or full-liquidation alternatives but said they didn't seem likely to produce more than $7 a share.

Business Wessex switch likely Adam Jones in New York 10/28/2000 The Times of London News International 2W 64 (Copyright Times Newspapers Ltd, 2000) Wessex Water's American parent company is likely to be taken private after a disastrous 14-month spell as a quoted company. Wessex, which provides water services to the South of England, was bought by Azurix in 1998 for Pounds 1.6 billion. Azurix wanted to use Wessex's expertise in privatised water supply to build a global business. However, since listing at $19 a share in June last year, Azurix stock has gone into freefall, closing at less than $4 earlier this week. Azurix slumped because it drastically misjudged the number of privatisation opportunities. It emerged last night that Enron, the Texan energy and trading company that is Azurix's biggest shareholder, has taken the unusual step of offering to lend Azurix $275 million (Pounds 190 million) to buy its publicly held shares, thereby taking it private. The Enron proposal would value Azurix at about $800 million or $7 per share - 63 per cent less than the IPO price. Enron would control Azurix and Wessex Water if it went private.

BUSINESS Enron water unit could go private under loan plan NELSON ANTOSH Staff 10/28/2000 Houston Chronicle 3 STAR 1 (Copyright 2000) Enron offered Friday to lend Azurix, its struggling water affiliate, about $275 million so Azurix can go private by purchasing 38.6 million shares that are publicly traded. The deal would have Azurix buying back its stock at $7 per share, about double what the shares were trading for Thursday. That's a big comedown for Azurix shares, which sold for $19 each when the Houston company went public in June 1999. The maneuver technically can be called a ""take-under,"" said analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities in Houston.

The common stock of Azurix zoomed Friday on the news, gaining $3 to close at $6.56 on the New York Stock Exchange. Becoming a private company would give Azurix management greater flexibility in restructuring. Coale said it would reduce Azurix's general and administrative costs, helping it to bid against lower- cost foreign competition, particularly two big French companies. Azurix's high cost structure has been its primary problem, she said. Azurix has been looking at cost and strategies ever since it got a new president and chief executive on Aug. 25, said Bazelides. That was the date that Rebecca Mark resigned as Azurix's high-profile chairman and chief executive. Enron and Azurix have been looking at ""strategic alternatives"" for nine months, J. Mark Meets, Enron's executive vice president for corporate development, said in a letter filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. One alternative was selling the company, he said. That didn't work out because the offers from three companies didn't exceed $4 per share. The fourth potential buyer said it would consider offering $7 per share, said Meets. But that suitor backed out, citing reasons like cash flow, complexity of the capital structure, tax considerations and pending securities litigation. ""We are obviously quite disappointed by this most recent turn of events,"" Meets said in the letter. ""However, we strongly believe that there is no other buyer willing to pay the $7 per share initially proposed (but later withdrawn) by the fourth bidder."" Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Ken Herman American-Statesman Capitol Bureau Chief 10/28/2000 Austin American-Statesman A1 (Copyright 2000) Not long ago, at a glossy wooden table in a Texas Capitol office, two of Gov. George W. Bush's high-level appointees discussed one of the key issues in state government these days. It involved the relative merits of White House posts that could be available to the two appointees if Bush becomes president. Asked this week whether it's a common topic around the Capitol, one of the appointees gestured to the anteroom of his office and made a motion indicating that even the midlevel folks have Washington on their minds. Near the banks of the Colorado, Potomac Fever is a near-epidemic. And though it is political faux pas to be too open about doing White House transition planning before Election Day, be assured it is going on at Bush headquarters, where top officials are cognizant of the fine line between looking too confident now and looking too unprepared later. The candidate himself -- as well as his top aides -- steers clear of transition talk. When asked who might wind up in his Cabinet, Bush looks backward instead of forward, saying that his selection of Dick Cheney as his running mate should offer a glimpse of the kind of people who would wind up in his administration. The transition work, such that it is, is under the aegis of longtime Bush friend and aide Clay Johnson, who began as head of the gubernatorial appointments office and now serves as chief of staff. Johnson said nobody has been interviewed for any Washington post, but he has compiled a file of folks who are interested in serving in a Bush administration. Johnson also has been reading up on previous transitions -- ones that went well and ones that didn't. His preliminary conclusion is that the outgoing administrations are generally helpful and supportive, even if they were ousted by the incoming administration. It's the incoming administrations that can make the mistakes, he said. There is no shortage of think tanks that have think-tanked the topic. Back in August, the Heritage Foundation, based in Washington, issued a transition handbook titled ""The Keys to a Successful Presidency."" ""Though we really don't expect either campaign to talk about it (and would discourage them from doing so), the message here is it's time to start planning for a possible presidential transition, quietly, well behind the scenes, but with the understanding that the preparation done during the next 70 or so days, and the work done in the 70 or so days that follow (between the election and the inauguration) will very well determine the initial success or failure of the next administration,"" Herbert Berkowitz, a foundation vice president, said in releasing the study. All indications are that the Bush team has been following the advice, with Johnson at the helm. Johnson cautions against expectations that a Bush administration would be overloaded with Texans. ""It's the United States of America, not the United States of Texas,"" he said. Despite that caveat, there is no shortage of Texans who are considered shoo-ins to fill some of the thousands of slots Bush could offer if he wins. Johnson confirms that he is very interested in a Washington job. Early speculation among Bush aides makes Johnson a potential leading contender for head of personnel at the White House. Karen Hughes, Bush's communications director since his 1994 gubernatorial campaign, is expected to become Bush's press secretary if he wins the White House. Karl Rove, Bush's longtime political guru, also will be on board, though he could wind up with an out-of- the-White-House post, perhaps at the Republican National Committee. Not as certain is the potential future for Joe Allbaugh, who is part of the ""iron triangle"" of top advisers -- along with Rove and Hughes -- who have been on board with Bush since the 1994 campaign. Allbaugh serves as manager of the presidential campaign and previously served as chief of staff in the governor's office. Capitol speculation indicates Allbaugh could decide to skip a White House post, possibly in favor of a lobbying job, if he is not tapped as chief of staff. That post could go to Don Evans, a longtime Bush friend who headed the megasuccessful fund-raising effort for the presidential campaign. However, not everyone has Potomac Fever. For example, Terral Smith, Bush's legislative director, said he will stay in Austin to lobby. In addition to the speculation about appointees, the approaching election has sparked talk about when Bush might leave office if he wins. Under the U.S. Constitution, he could remain governor until he has to become president on Jan. 20. Much more likely, however, is that Bush would leave office sooner than that, perhaps as soon as two or three weeks after the Nov. 7 election, if he wins. That could cause a housing problem for Bush, whose main residence is the Governor's Mansion, which comes as a free perk of the job. The Bushes have a home under construction at their ranch in Crawford, near Waco. The ranch also has a smaller house in which the Bushes now spend weekends. Not out of the question is that Bush could work out an arrangement with Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, who would become governor if Bush resigns, to remain in the Governor's Mansion for several weeks after he leaves office. If the race among Texas senators to replace Perry as lieutenant governor complicates the timing of the resignation, Bush could stay in the governor's office a little longer, but no later than the first week of January. After all, he will want to give Perry time to bask in his gubernatorial inauguration before the Legislature convenes Jan. 9. No matter when Bush resigns, confidantes believe he might use his Crawford ranch for interviews with potential top-level appointees, including Cabinet members.

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A Dynegy executive said Friday that the California Independent System Operator's plan to impose hourly price caps on the wholesale power market will compromise reliability by forcing generators to sell electricity out of state. ""If the ISO says it will not buy above a certain price and generators cannot operate below that price, then we have no choice but to find other markets to participate in,"" said Dynegy senior vice president of marketing and trading asset management Lynn Lednicky. ""That may lead to the ISO not finding the power it needs at a price it wants to pay."" The ISO plans to construct hourly price caps each month based on forecast load, natural gas prices and generation unit efficiency. The caps will take effect Nov. 3 or soon therafter. Dynegy Inc. (DYN) sent a letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission asking it to address reliability consequences of the price caps before Nov. 3. Dynegy specifically requested that FERC discuss the issue at its Nov. 1 meeting, when it will release a report on California's electricity problems. Enron Corp. (ENE) and Southern Company (SO) share Dynegy's concerns about reliability and plan to petition FERC about the issue, said a trader listening in to a conference call between the three companies. -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872; jessica.berthold@dowjones.com Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES New York -(Dow Jones)- Shares of Azurix Corp. (AZX) jumped 84% in heavy trading Friday after parent Enron Corp. (ENE) proposed to take the company private in a $7-a-share buyout. Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that Enron made the proposal after not being satisfied with offers it had received from four third parties for its stake in Azurix. In a letter to two members of Azurix's board, Enron said three potential buyers ""were unlikely to be willing to pay more than the then-current market price of approximately $4 a share."" Enron said a fourth potential buyer indicated it would consider a $7-a-share offer, but it said that proposal was recently withdrawn. ""The reasons given by the bidder included pro forma cash flows, the complexity of the capital structure, tax considerations and the currently pending securities litigation,"" the letter said. Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Houston-based Enron, declined to say whether Enron was entertaining current third-party interests or was in any talks with other parties regarding its Azurix stake. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Azurix ended Friday up $3 to $6.56 on 2.8 million shares, compared with average daily volume of 239,000 shares. Enron was up $1.38, or 1.8%, to $78.88 on 1.6 million shares, compared with its daily average turnover of 2.4 million. In the SEC filing, Enron, saying it's familiar with Azurix's various partial and full liquidation alternatives, said its buyout proposal is conditioned upon Azurix not selling any significant assets prior to the buyout. ""Although we agree that such plans may result in greater value to Azurix's shareholders than the maintenance of the status quo, we believe that these options almost certainly will not result on a present value in a greater return to Azurix's shareholders than $7 a share,"" the letter said. Enron also said its buyout proposal doesn't include any breakup fees or other ""deal protection devices."" This frees Azurix's board to pursue an acquisition that ""might provide greater value"" to shareholders. Daine Bazelides, a spokeswoman for Azurix, declined to say whether Azurix is now entertaining offers for the company. She did, however, confirm the information contained in Enron's filing. ""The historical information in the filing is factually correct,"" she told Dow Jones Newswires. She said she doesn't know when Azurix board will respond to Enron's proposal. In the filing, Enron didn't set a deadline, but warned that Azurix's position with customers and employees may deteriorate further. ""We must therefore reserve the right to withdraw our proposal at any time,"" Enron's letter said. In the letter, Enron pointed out that Azurix had retained two ""internationally recognized investment bankers"" early this year to evaluate strategic alternatives, which included the potential sale of the company to unrelated third parties. Enron said it strongly believes there isn't another buyer willing to pay $7 a share for Enron's indirect interest in Azurix. ""We believe it is in Azurix's best interest, as well as the best interest of its shareholders and employees, if Azurix were no longer a publicly traded company,"" Enron said. -By Christopher C. Williams, Dow Jones Newswires, 201-938-5219; christopher.williams@dowjones.com Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Enron offers to buy out Azurix Financial Times By Hillary Durgin in Houston Published: October 27 2000 23:31GMT | Last Updated: October 27 2000 23:36GMT Enron, the Houston-based energy and trading group, said on Friday it had offered up to $275m in funding to take Azurix private at a buy-out price of $7 per share. The specific structure of Enron's proposal has yet to be determined, Enron said. Azurix said its board would now consider the proposal. The timing of any decision was unclear. Enron owns directly and indirectly about 66 per cent of Azurix, the troubled Houston water company, whose main asset is UK-based Wessex Water. The buyout offer is the latest development in a history of problems at Azurix, which was spun off from Enron and taken public at an offering price of $19 per share. But a combination of poor market timing, competitive industry conditions and empty promises by the company on Wall Street took their toll on the company, whose shares have since plummeted and have been trading most recently around the $3-per-share range. In August, Rebecca Mark, Azurix chief executive officer, resigned both from Azurix and from the board at Enron. Enron's offer came after four unnamed parties approached Enron about buying its stake in Azurix. While three of the four were unwilling to pay more than the then market price of about $4 per share, a fourth party who was considering offering $7 per share (before accounting for any dilution for stock options) later declined to pursue the transaction, Enron said in Friday's letter to Azurix, outlining the buyout proposal. ""We strongly believe that our proposal is fair to Azurix's public stockholders,"" the letter stated. ""Our proposed transaction would permit Azurix's stockholders to receive, on a timely basis, a cash payment for their shares that is significantly above the price at which those shares have traded in several months."" Analysts that follow Azurix and had valued the shares at between $6 and $8 per shares said the offer was fair. Analysts that follow Enron said that Azurix's business strategy had proved to be a failure and was characteristic of the hard asset approach that Enron has gradually distanced itself from. Enron's shares closed at $78.88 up $1.38 on Friday. Azurix's shares rose $3 to close at $6.56.",1,"Company Business, Strategy, etc."

From: Julee Malinowski-Ball, Edson + Modisette
RE: Legislative Status Report Week Ending 4/20


RECENT EVENTS:

-- IEP with the help of Chris Ellison has been at the negotiating table mos=
t
of the week dealing with the most recent amendments to SB 28x.  SB 28x
(Sher/Battin) makes various changes to the siting process including many
IEP-sponsored proposals.  As you will recall, two new provisions were added
to the bill at the last minute before going to the Assembly Floor dealing
with both retrofit schedules and environmental dispatch of generating
facilities.  Per the direction from IEP member companies, IEP has decided
not to negotiate on the environmental dispatch issue. If the provision
remained in the bill, IEP would continue to push the Republicans to hold
their opposed position. We were, however, given the authority to negotiate
on the retrofit issue as long as we were only talking about facilities that
already have retrofit requirements.  I will be faxing out the agreed upon
language which in essence says the ARB shall set a schedule for the
completion of any mandated retrofits.  It does not expand the authority of
the air districts and ARB to mandate retrofits under existing law. The
schedule would require completion of the retrofits by July 1, 2004 or such
later date as the ISO determines is necessary to maintain reliability.

With these amendments, including some clean-up language, SB 28x will be
voted-on on the Assembly floor on Monday and go to the Senate for
concurrence on Tuesday.  The final version will include the following
IEP-sponsored proposals:

? Conforming the timing of offsets for power plants to Clean Air Act
requirements
? Substituting CEQA-style hearings for the trial-like proceedings of the CE=
C
? Streamlining the permit process for the modernization of existing power
plant sites
? Giving consideration to the positive environmental impacts of a proposed
project.
? Improving the timeliness and coordination of state and local agency
review.
? Extending the current deadlines for the expedited review process
established in AB 970.

Since SB 28x is only a first step in making changes to the siting process,
IEP member should now be thinking about what is next.  IEP proposals still
on the table include:

? Permitting local agencies to make zoning changes or other decisions for
power plants contingent upon CEC CEQA Compliance
? Giving deference to other state and regional agencies
? Easing the threshold for override of local land use requirements.
? Making the ISO responsible for determining interconnection requirements

-- Bad news on the =01&California First=018 issue quickly followed the good=
 news.
The CEC staff analysis which said the State can't require builders of new
power plants to sell electricity here, even as a trade-off for expedited
permitting, was countered by another staff analysis that says the state can=
.
Both documents cannot be obtained due to attorney-client privilege.  This
issue is coming to a head next week with a decision pending by the CEC to
include a California First clause on the approval of an expedited AES power
plant project.

AB 60x (Hertzberg), which ties to the siting process the requirement that a
developer enter into a contract to sell power to specified California
entities, is still poised to be heard in the Senate Energy committee.  IEP
members company lobbyist should continue to lobby against this measure
regardless of the CEC=01,s decision on AES, although our arguments are
definitely strengthened if the addition of the clause at the CEC is denied.

-- IEP has finalized negotiations with Senator Burton=01,s office on amendm=
ents
attempting to solve our problem with the eminent domain provision in SB 6x
(Burton), which is the State Power Authority measure.  Attached is a copy o=
f
the bill in PDF form.  The agreed upon language, which clarifies that the
Authority=01,s purpose is to supplement existing generation activities, can=
 be
found on pages 6-7 (Section 3310), 13 (Section 3341.1) and 16-17
(Section3352). Considering the inflammatory remarks made by Senator Burton
in the press lately regarding seizing generation assets, this was most
likely the best we could get.

-- The first of Senator Dunn=01,s hearings with the Senate Select Committee=
 to
Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Market occurred this week.
This week and next week=01,s topics will be to go over previous investigati=
ons
into market power. The committee heard or will be hearing testimony from:
Frank Wolak, Chairman Market Surveillance Committee, CAISO; Eric
Hildebrandt, Manager Market Monitoring, CAISO; and, Elaine Howle, State
Auditor.

--  The Assembly Electricity Oversight Subcommittee met this week and
focused on the issue of natural gas collusion. Testifying before the
committee were representatives from Dynegy and El Paso, commenting on the
rise of natural gas prices and whether illegal market manipulation and
collusion occurred.  The subcommittee plans on putting together a package o=
f
bills related to natural gas issues, which would be the culmination of the
committee=01,s hearings over the last two months.  This package will be up =

While it won't directly hamper Davis' plan for solving the energy crisis, t=

The bonds are intended to replenish the state treasury as well as finance=
=20
future power purchases. Since mid-January the state has committed $5.7=20

Southern California Edison. The commitment has chewed up a significant=20
portion of a budget surplus estimated by state Treasurer Phil Angelides at=

nearly $6 billion; Davis and other state officials have pegged the surplus =
at=20
$8 billion.=20
Either way, it's clear that the power expenditures have left Wall Street an=

""The fact is that the state's credit rating and financial strength will=20

Angelides spent much of the day urging legislators to pass legislation to g=

Angelides said lawmakers must quickly pass the new bill -- which requires a=

=20
won't fork over the funds until they're assured the bonds will be sold,=20
because the state will use the bond proceeds in part to pay off that loan, =

Ironically, the sale of those bonds won't be hurt by the S&P downgrade=20
because customer revenue instead of taxpayer dollars are being used to pay=

""What's important for the bonds is how the (utility) rates are structured t=

Senators offer bill to put a lid on power prices: Sen. Dianne Feinstein say=

there's a good chance the proposal can get out of committee.
By Les Blumenthal
Bee Washington Bureau
(Published April 25, 2001)=20
WASHINGTON -- West Coast senators formally introduced legislation Tuesday t=
o=20
temporarily cap wholesale electric rates and expressed hope that their=20
proposal to ease the huge run-up in energy prices might clear the committee=
=20
and make it to a vote on the Senate floor.=20
""I think we are very close to having the votes in committee,"" Sen. Dianne=
=20
Feinstein, D-Calif., said of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee tha=
t=20
has jurisdiction over the bill. ""I am taking nothing for granted, but the=
=20
committee is 50-50.""=20
There are 11 Democrats and 11 Republicans on the committee, including=20
Feinstein and the other primary sponsor of the bill, Oregon Sen. Gordon=20
Smith.=20
Smith, a Republican, is the swing vote.=20
Feinstein said the committee chairman, Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, has=
=20
shown an increasing willingness to help her and Smith move the legislation,=
=20
though some differences remain.=20
""He (Murkowski) has told me he'd like to help,"" Feinstein said. ""I think we=
=20
are very close to a markup and this could move quickly.""=20
Murkowski did not rule out price caps but said he thought the bill sacrific=
ed=20
long-term solutions for short-term gains.=20
""I have concerns about the proposal put forward today and the impact it may=
=20
have in distorting the market,"" he said. ""It is time to address the=20
underlying causes -- not just the symptoms.""=20
Feinstein's comments came at a news conference during which she, Smith,=20
Washington state Democratic Sens. Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, and New=
=20
Mexico Sen. Jeff Bingaman, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Energy=20
Committee, unveiled details of the bill and criticized the Bush=20
administration and federal regulators for failing to take action to cap=20
rates.=20
If approved by Congress and signed by President Bush, the bill would give t=
he=20
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 60 days to impose price caps or set up=
 a=20
cost-based rate structure that would allow electricity generators to recove=
r=20
their costs and earn a fair return.=20
The controls would apply in 11 Western states, including California, Oregon=
=20
and Washington. Similar legislation has been introduced in the House of=20
Representatives.=20
The lawmakers said the price controls would remain in effect until March=20
2003, when, they said, enough new generating plants will have come on line =
to=20
overcome the West's current electricity shortage.=20
Under federal law, FERC has the authority to ensure wholesale rates are jus=
t=20
and reasonable.=20
Feinstein said that during a warm day this summer California may fall 2,000=
=20
megawatts short of meeting demand and on a hot day with air conditioners=20
cranked up, there could be a 10,000-megawatt shortfall.=20
Feinstein said that in 1999 California utilities paid $7 billion for=20
electricity, in 2000 more than $32 billion and, according to some estimates=
,=20
the price tag could reach $65 billion this year.=20
""There has been a very strong element of price gouging in this,"" Feinstein=
=20
said.=20
""We should not have to pass legislation to compensate for a federal agency=
=20
not doing its job,"" Murray said, adding that Northwest utilities were payin=
g=20
the highest prices in the country for next-day delivery of wholesale power.=
=20
""This (bill) will bring the market under control until new generation comes=
=20
on line.""=20
Cantwell, who is also a committee member, said wholesale rates have risen=
=20
11-fold over the past several months, resulting in thousands of layoffs in=
=20
the region and the shutdown of the aluminum industry.=20
""We cannot allow our government to sit idly by and allow a tragically flawe=
d=20
and easily manipulated power market to wreak havoc on our economy and quali=
ty=20
of life,"" Cantwell said.=20
The Bonneville Power Administration has indicated it may have to raise its=
=20
wholesale rates by 250 percent this fall as it is forced to buy power on=20
expensive spot markets because a severe drought in the Pacific Northwest ha=
s=20
reduced electricity production at the region's vast hydropower system. BPA=
=20
supplies 45 percent of the Northwest's wholesale electricity.=20
Smith said that, as a Republican, he was initially reluctant to support pri=
ce=20
control and would have preferred the market sort out its own problems.=20
But, he said, ""Hard-nosed business practices that generate big profits are=
=20
not always good politics. It's a mistake to defend a system that some can=
=20
game to make incredible profits.""=20
The Oregon senator said he knew his decision to sponsor the bill was not=20
well-received at the White House.=20
""I know I'm not making any friends down the street,"" he said. ""It's importa=
nt=20
to keep this bipartisan, and I'm not going to attack the Bush=20
administration.""=20
Both Smith and Feinstein said a FERC staff proposal to cap wholesale electr=
ic=20
rates in California when rolling blackouts are imminent falls well short of=
=20
what's needed. FERC will consider the proposal at a meeting today.=20
""California is not the only state affected,"" said Smith. ""This is not a=20
California problem alone.""=20
Feinstein said the proposal was inadequate.=20
""I'm not sure that is the right way to go,"" she said. ""The only reason they=

Energy price gouging might end up felony
By Emily Bazar
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published April 25, 2001)=20
Democratic lawmakers this week will unveil a proposal to make energy price=
=20
gouging a felony -- punishable by stiff fines and possible jail time -- tha=
t=20
could be subject to the state's controversial ""three strikes"" law.=20
The measure, sponsored by Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, would punish companies=
=20
that sell electricity or natural gas in California at ""unjust or unreasonab=
le=20
rates.""=20
""There is a tremendous amount of wealth that is being transferred from=20
California to five companies, mostly in Texas,"" Bustamante said. ""If what=
=20
they're doing isn't illegal, it ought to be.""=20
Though lawmakers are expected to introduce the measure Thursday, it already=
=20
has generated opposition from Republican lawmakers and constitutional=20
questions from legal experts.=20
Several aspects of the bill, AB 67x, are unresolved and could change.=20
But the intent will remain the same, and energy companies that take advanta=
ge=20
of Californians will still face significant penalties, said the bill's=20
author, Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza, D-Merced.=20
According to a draft version of the bill and some proposed amendments, a=20
corporation, or a person with decision-making authority at the corporation,=
=20
would be found guilty of a felony if ""they collude or conspire to manipulat=
e=20
the market to achieve unjust or unreasonable rates for electricity or natur=
al=20
gas.""=20
A state or federal regulatory agency -- such as the Federal Energy Regulato=
ry=20
Commission -- would determine whether rates were unjust or unreasonable. If=
=20
that happened, the bill would open the door for prosecution by the state=20
attorney general or local district attorneys.=20
In addition, if found guilty, companies would be forced to pay restitution=
=20
and could face fines as high as 10 percent of their gross corporate assets.=
=20
Lawmakers are debating whether to make the felony a ""three strikes"" offense=
,=20
which requires 25 years to life sentences for some people convicted of thre=
e=20
felonies.=20
Though the provision was in an early draft of the bill, Cardoza said it's=
=20
""not likely"" to show up in the final version.=20
""While I think this crime is every bit as abhorrent as going in and stealin=
g=20
money from a bank, we're going to have to figure out a little bit different=
=20
way of dealing with it,"" he said.=20
Even without the three strikes provision, the bill raises certain=20
constitutional issues, said Clark Kelso, a professor at the McGeorge School=
=20
of Law in Sacramento.=20
For instance, he said, it's not clear whether the state can legally base a=
=20
fine on an out-of-state company's gross assets.=20
And the measure, which requires a two-thirds vote for passage, already has=
=20
generated Republican opposition.=20
""To the extent this bill is onerous toward power producers, it may deter th=
em=20
from selling here rather than risk fines and prison,"" said James Fisfis, a=

Dan Walters: It's time for politicians to be honest about the energy crisis


(Published April 25, 2001)=20
Gov. Gray Davis is continuing to tell Californians that he's on top of the=
=20
state's energy crisis and, as he said at one gathering last week, ""in three=
=20
years, this problem will be a distant memory."" Fat chance. All major aspect=
s=20
of the situation are growing worse, not better, minute by minute.=20
Politicians took over the crisis in January as the state's major utilities=
=20
exhausted their cash reserves and lines of credit. Davis began what he said=
=20
then would be a short-term emergency program of power purchases to keep=20
electrons flowing into homes and businesses.=20
From that moment forward, the situation has steadily deteriorated, moving=
=20
toward a three-pronged disaster: severe summer blackouts, the bankruptcy of=

the utilities and sharply escalating power bills. With the bankruptcy filin=
g=20
by Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and decisions by Davis and the state Public=

Utilities Commission to begin ratcheting up utility rates, two of the three=
=20
negative scenarios are now in place. And everyone involved in the crisis=20
expects blackouts this summer as demands for power soar and supplies dwindl=
e.=20
The Davis strategy, if there is one, is to continue the state's massive pow=
er=20
purchases while negotiating longer-term and presumably cheaper supply=20
contracts, encourage conservation, help utilities pay off their debts by=20
selling their intercity transmission system to the state and tapping=20
ratepayers, and build more power plants to ease the supply crunch.=20
Currently, the governor is touting his deal with Edison International, pare=
nt=20
company of Southern California Edison, to sell its portion of the power gri=
d=20
and is working on a similar deal with Sempra, the parent of San Diego Gas &=
=20
and Electric. But PG&E's bankruptcy filing casts doubt on the viability of=
=20
the cash-for-grid concept, and legislators, particularly Davis' fellow=20
Democrats, are very skeptical of the Edison deal.=20
Clearly, Davis rushed into the Edison deal just three days after PG&E made=
=20
its bankruptcy filing, in hopes of erasing the political stain of the latte=
r=20
action, but its provisions are being labeled a bailout by critics. It place=
s=20
only a token financial burden on Edison International while guaranteeing th=
e=20
profitability of its utility subsidiary by charging its customers whatever =
is=20
required to cover its costs and past debts.=20
Meanwhile, the state is spending -- by Davis' own account -- about $70=20
million a day or $2 billion-plus a month on spot power purchases, paying=20
roughly five times what consumers are being charged at the retail level. An=
d=20
the futures market for power indicates that wholesale power prices will jum=
p=20
50 percent by midsummer; higher prices and greater purchases could increase=
=20
the drain on the state treasury to as much as $5 billion a month.=20
State Treasurer Phil Angelides is desperately trying to arrange a bridge lo=
an=20
to relieve pressure on the state's rapidly vanishing reserves, but Wall=20
Street is reluctant to lend without a fuller explanation of what's happenin=
g=20
and a specific authorization from a suspicious Legislature. Meanwhile,=20
bankers are sending strong signals that the state government is becoming as=

Davis, for some reason, is unwilling to declare this situation the emergenc=

that things will turn out all right, even declaring to reporters on Tuesday=

It's time for someone -- the governor, preferably, but someone -- to lay ou=

legislation to speed up repayment of $5 billion drained from the state's=20
general fund to buy electricity this year. That figure is expected to reach=
=20
$15 billion by year's end, according to the governor.
?????The consequences of a downgrade are profound, Angelides said, noting=
=20
that it took California years to overcome the downgrades spurred by the=20
recession of the early 1990s.
?????""It is critical that the Legislature act immediately to clearly=20
establish our legal authority to sell bonds and replenish the state's gener=
al=20
fund,"" Angelides said.
?????California began buying massive quantities of electricity in January=
=20
because the state's three major investor-owned utilities could no longer=20
afford to do so. Since then, the state has been purchasing roughly one-thir=
d=20
of the electricity the utilities need to service their customers, according=
=20
to state officials.
?????Under a plan approved by the Legislature and signed into law by Davis,=
=20
the general fund is supposed to be reimbursed for the power purchases with=
=20
what is expected to be the largest municipal bond issue in U.S. history. Th=
e=20
bond issue is to be repaid by utility ratepayers through a monthly charge o=
n=20
their electricity bills.
?????However, obstacles that threaten timely repayment of the fund are=20
causing consternation among Wall Street analysts about California's financi=

status.
?????The bankruptcy filing of Pacific Gas & Electric Co., the state's large=
st=20
investor-owned utility, has thwarted the state's plan to restore the=20
utilities to financial health.
?????But it is a dispute over the state's formula for repaying the bonds th=
at=20
has raised the most concern among state officials. The state and the=20
utilities are at odds over how much of consumers' electricity payments shou=
ld=20
go to reimburse the state for its power purchases.
?????The state's two major utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern=
=20
California Edison, have challenged the Public Utilities Commission's plan f=

splitting up the money--a legal move that threatens to delay issuance of th=

bonds. The firms contend the allotment granted to the state is too generous=

and could make it harder for them to recover from the energy crisis.
?????Hoping to sidestep the controversy, Angelides is urging state lawmaker=

Price Controls Spark Deja Vu=20

Energy: The specter of Richard Nixon's actions 30 years ago hangs over=20
current debate on how to check the state's surging power costs.=20

By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer=20

?????A debate now rages in California over whether price controls should be=
=20
adopted to stem the state's soaring power costs and help consumers who are=
=20
bracing for huge spikes in their electric bills.
?????But price controls are one of the most controversial actions in=20
economics--and in politics, for that matter. And now the caps are more in=
=20
dispute than ever because they run counter to the nation's move over the la=
st=20
two decades to deregulate more and more industries, from airlines to=20
railroads to energy.
?????Yet California is a good example of deregulation gone haywire, so=20
controls are again being demanded by lawmakers, consumer advocates and othe=
rs=20
as a way to check surging prices. On the other side is a chorus of critics=
=20
who ridicule price caps as being ineffective and, at times, making matters=
=20
worse for consumers.
?????Case in point: the Golden State itself, which tried last summer to use=
=20
temporary price caps to keep a lid on skyrocketing wholesale electricity=20
prices.
?????Critics claim that the caps drove power sales out of state, thus=20
widening the imbalance between supply and demand, reinforcing the existing=
=20
shortages and contributing to this winter's rolling blackouts.
?????But defenders of the caps note that the dysfunctional California marke=
t=20
had no way to self-correct. The utilities couldn't simply refuse to buy=20
electricity in the face of higher prices, and with no price ceiling in sigh=
t,=20
something had to be done.
?????And now Gov. Gray Davis and others are again calling for temporary=20
controls until more electricity supplies can be added, especially as the=20
state enters the peak-power summer season. On Tuesday, Sens. Dianne Feinste=
in=20
(D-Calif.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) introduced legislation that would impo=
se=20
price controls on wholesale energy throughout 11 Western states.
?????Mindful of the controversial history of controls, Feinstein and Smith=
=20
stressed that the caps would last only through March 1, 2003. But they also=
=20
argued that the economic damage to industries and consumers from escalating=
=20
power costs would exceed any harm caused by price controls.
?????""I have a strong preference for markets, but it's a mistake to believe=
=20
that we have a free market when it comes to energy,"" said Smith, the only G=
OP=20
co-sponsor of the legislation.
?????Their bill would require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, whi=
ch=20
regulates U.S. wholesale electricity prices, either to impose a regional=20
price cap or institute a rate schedule for each power generator, tying the=
=20
price of electricity to the cost of producing it.
?????Coincidentally, FERC today is expected to decide on various other=20
proposals to again limit California's power costs--but without explicitly=
=20
stating that the plans include price controls. Why? Because the Bush=20
administration and FERC Chairman Curt Hebert Jr., among others, are on the=
=20
record as adamantly opposing price caps.
?????That's not surprising. Price controls often are tagged as a liberal=20
maneuver that flies in the face of conservatives' free-market ideology. Yet=
,=20
ironically, hanging over the California debate is the legacy of a Republica=
n=20
president who was the last one to mandate price controls on a nationwide=20
level: Richard M. Nixon.
?????The late president took that rare step 30 years ago this August to try=
=20
to quell inflation and spark an economic rebound. His actions were so=20
dramatic that they are still invoked by those wanting to criticize or, in=
=20
some cases, endorse setting limits on prices.
?????""What he did is almost larger than life now,"" said Shannon Burchett,=
=20
chief executive of RiskLimited Corp., a strategic consulting firm in Dallas=
.
?????Nixon's controls were the most far-reaching since World War II, when=
=20
prices were capped so that profiteers couldn't reap huge sums for scarce=20
commodities being used for the war and simultaneously rationed at home.
?????In most cases, price controls have been much less sweeping and targete=
d=20
at specific products or services. They don't always involve changing the la=
w,=20
either. In 1962, President Kennedy publicly rebuked the then-U.S. Steel Cor=
p.=20
and its chairman, Roger Blough, for starting an industrywide move to raise=
=20
steel prices. The price hikes were rolled back a few days later.
?????Since Nixon, price controls have become rarer as industries that were=
=20
once regulated--which means their prices were government-controlled--have=
=20
been deregulated.
?????So it is in California, where electric utilities' prices were controll=
ed=20
for decades until the state's deregulation law in 1996. But now that the la=
w=20
has been blamed for the soaring wholesale prices, power shortages, crippled=
=20
utilities and the need for a huge jump in ratepayers' costs, some again wan=
t=20
price controls on electricity until the crisis eases.
?????Which brings everyone back to Nixon.

?????Some Nixon Controls Were Lifted by Reagan
?????""I've heard people make the analogy to what happened . . . when Nixon=
=20
put on controls,"" but in California ""this is fundamentally different,"" said=
=20
Mike Florio, a board member of the California Independent System Operator,=
=20
which oversees most of the state's electricity grid.
?????""When you get into a situation of shortage [of supplies], there is=20
really no restraint at all on prices,"" said Florio, who said he normally=20
prefers unfettered markets but also defended the state's caps last summer.=
=20
Such government intervention ""on a temporary basis is better than nothing,=
=20
but I don't think it's ideal.""
?????The reverberations from Nixon's fiat aren't just felt in California=20
either. When New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani recently proposed more stringe=
nt=20
controls on wholesale electricity costs in New York state, critics promptly=
=20
pointed to Nixon's controls. ""They were a disaster,"" one columnist wrote.
?????Even Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who was in the private=
=20
sector in the early 1970s, turned down several requests to take high-level=
=20
White House jobs in part because he was disgusted with Nixon's price contro=
ls.
?????Many economists and historians also judge Nixon's controls as a mistak=
e.=20
But some maintain that his decision--which began with a 90-day freeze on=20
prices, wages and rents--wasn't entirely a failure and even provided ""shock=
=20
value"" that, for a while at least, arrested higher inflation.
?????In addition, part of Nixon's move involved taking the dollar off the=
=20
gold standard--which in effect meant its price was controlled--and letting =
it=20
float in value against other major currencies. And that, many believe, is t=
he=20
base upon which today's global financial markets operate.
?????Others disagree.
?????""There really isn't an example of where they've [price controls]=20
worked,"" said Robert Goldberg, a senior fellow at the National Center for=
=20
Policy Analysis, a nonpartisan think tank in New York.
?????""Controls always lead to an underproduction"" of the commodity involved=
=20
because producers don't have any incentive to spend more on additional=20
output, he said. When the caps ultimately are lifted, prices typically soar=
=20
anyway as producers move to quickly recoup the profit they lost when the=20
controls were in place, Goldberg added.
?????Others note that although most of Nixon's price controls lasted only a=
=20
couple of years, various forms of controls over crude oil and natural gas=
=20
lasted for another decade until they were removed by President Ronald Reaga=
n.
?????In the meantime, the controls--aggravated by embargoes and other suppl=
y=20
cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries--distorted the fr=
ee=20
market for energy, critics say. The controls kept U.S. oil prices=20
artificially low, which in turn kept demand for oil high, giving OPEC more=
=20
power over world production and prices in the 1970s, they contend.
?????Nonetheless, proponents keep calling for controls when prices for=20
certain items seem to be spiraling out of control.

?????Critics Say Controls Worsen the Problems
?????President Clinton's massive health-reform proposal in the early 1990s=
=20
included price controls on drugs. But the idea set off howls of protest fro=
m=20
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, and ultimately the entire=
=20
proposal was shelved. Consumer advocates and others also demanded federal=
=20
controls on rising cable TV rates in 1997 and 1998, again contending that t=
he=20
cable operators were hiking prices at a much faster rate than inflation.=20
Cable firms were allowed to keep passing certain costs on to their=20
subscribers, but specific price caps weren't enacted.
?????But proponents of temporary price controls on California power emphasi=
ze=20
that electricity isn't in the same category as an airplane seat, steel or=
=20
other commodities that don't have to be bought if the price soars too high.
?????""In soybeans maybe the market can adjust quickly"" to changes in supply=
=20
and demand, ""but in electric generation in California it can't,"" said Flori=
o,=20
who also serves as an attorney for the Utility Reform Network, a consumer=
=20
group. ""For most products, one of the ways prices get determined is if buye=
rs=20
refuse to buy when the price gets too high. But that's generally not an=20
option for people when it comes to electricity.""
?????Critics of California's attempt to cap prices last summer said the=20
controls instead prompted many power suppliers to sell their electricity to=
=20
other states. That ""actually made the tight-supply problem worse [in=20
California] by driving imports out of the state,"" the Bay Area Economic=20
Forum, a research group funded by regional business and government agencies=
,=20
said in a report last week.
?????Indeed, the temporary caps were basically abandoned by year's end to=
=20
keep enough electricity in the state.
?????Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economics professor who heads the=
=20
Independent System Operator's market surveillance committee, said there are=
=20
ways to mitigate the state's power prices without having to set rigid=20
controls. One proposal: Have FERC require that generators supply 75% of the=
ir=20
expected future sales to California under long-term contracts at ""just and=
=20
reasonable"" prices set by the federal agency, he said.
?????That would ""send the right [price] signal to suppliers to come into th=
e=20
state,"" Wolak said.
?????And because it will take time for California to get more of its own=20
power-generating plants up and running, the state's electricity crisis isn'=
t=20
unlike a natural disaster in which ""normal public service is disrupted"" and=
=20
short-term controls serve a purpose, Florio said.
?????""Over time, market forces will work"" and controls shouldn't be need, h=
e=20
said. ""But does that mean we're supposed to pay $10,000 per kilowatt-hour=
=20
until something gets done?""

?????In an interview, Sklar said his father was a mechanical engineer who=

Power Plant Emits Tons of Fumes=20

Round-the-clock operation of old generators in Glendale and elsewhere=20

pounds of pollutants into the air during peak demand, more than double the=

old limit of 390 pounds a day, city and air-quality officials said.
?????The other 14 power plants in Southern California also have more than=
=20
doubled their overall emissions, according to preliminary figures from the=

South Coast Air Quality Management District. As a group, the plants emitted=
 a=20
total of 2,045 tons of smog-forming nitrogen oxide in the first three month=
s=20
of 2001, compared with 905 tons for the same period last year.
?????The AQMD hearing board on Tuesday eased pollution controls so Glendale=
=20
may continue to generate excess electricity for sale to the energy-starved=
=20
state. Under the plan, Glendale may run three of its old steam boilers=20
around-the-clock to meet the state's energy demand. Usually, these boilers,=
=20
hidden behind a tall brick wall, sit idle except during the peak summer=20
demand because they are inefficient and costly.
?????Glendale, like Burbank and the Los Angeles Department of Water and=20
Power, continues to produce electricity at its city-owned plant. The three=

cities opted against participating in a scheme of deregulation, a decision=

that has shielded their residents, by and large, from the huge utility rate=

hikes and rolling power outages experienced elsewhere. But they also will=

contribute to easing the state's energy emergency in the dirtier air they=

will be forced to breathe.
?????Air-quality officials said power plants contribute just about 3% of th=

900 tons of pollution emitted into the air daily, with about 70% of the=20
pollution coming from vehicles, not factories. And in recent years, many of=

pollution-control devices that reduce emissions.
?????Glendale's three steam generators, built between 1953 and 1963, are=20
inefficient by today's standards, but they are 85% cleaner since the city=

officials say, with more retrofitting.
?????Under the plan, Glendale must reinvest profits from energy sales,=20
estimated at $3 million to $5 million this year, in equipment to reduce=20
future emissions at the plant and in community-based programs, such as mobi=

50,000 homes. Under the decision Tuesday, pollution limits resume Jan. 1,=

2002, or when the energy emergency ends.
?????In Los Angeles, power officials said they don't expect to exceed AQMD=

Angelina Galiteva, LADWP's director of strategic planning.
?????""We will have much cleaner equipment in place by June,"" she said.
?????Even the environmentalists are trying to balance the risks.
?????""We realize we have a problem this summer. We have to run these plants=

said Sheryl Carter, a senior policy analyst for the National Resources=20
Defense Council.
?????Carter said natural-gas-powered generators, like the ones in Glendale,=

S&P lowers California's bond rating=20
First cut since '94 could cost taxpayers millions=20

Citing the ""rapidly escalating uncertainty"" surrounding the power crisis,=
=20
Standard & Poor's slashed California's credit rating yesterday for the firs=
t=20
time since 1994, when the state was still climbing out of a recession.=20
The downgrade -- and the energy debacle that led up to it -- will cost=20
taxpayers tens or hundreds of millions of dollars a year by raising the=20
state's borrowing costs. Investors will probably see the market price of=20
California municipal bonds and bond funds decline further.=20
But the biggest blow may be to the state's ego. S&P downgraded the state's=
=20
general obligation bonds two notches -- to A+ from AA. The only other state=
=20
currently rated A+ is Hawaii. The only state with a lower credit rating is=
=20
Louisiana, according to S&P.=20
Most states are rated AA. Some states don't have a credit rating because th=
ey=20
don't have bonds.=20
California's credit rating is still ""investment grade,"" which means it is n=
ot=20
expected to default on its bonds. However, the state's ability to repay its=
=20
debt ""isn't as strong as it used to be,"" said Steve Zimmermann, a managing=
=20
director with Standard & Poor's. ""This is a very speculative situation.""=20
States hire companies like S&P to give them an independent credit rating wh=
en=20
they borrow money by selling bonds. The rating reflects the state's ability=
=20
to repay its debt in full, on time.=20
When they sell new bonds, states with lower credit ratings usually pay high=
er=20
interest than higher-rated states, to make up for the added risk.=20
A rating change does not affect the interest rate states pay on bonds that=
=20
have already been issued, but it can affect the price of bonds when they=20
trade on the open market among investors.=20
Yesterday's downgrade ""reflects the mounting and uncertain cost to the stat=
e=20
of the current electrical power crisis, as well as its likely long-term=20
detrimental effect on the state's economy,"" S&P said in a news release.=20
""Given the large magnitude of the problem in relation to the size of fund=
=20
balances the state typically budgets, the capacity to pay debt service, whi=
le=20
still adequate, has been reduced.""=20
In January, S&P placed the state's debt on ""CreditWatch with negative=20
implications,"" a signal that it might lower the rating.=20
In an unusual move, S&P kept the state on CreditWatch after yesterday's=20
downgrade, which means the rating could fall even lower.=20
Zimmermann said S&P is keeping California on CreditWatch pending its abilit=
y=20
to sell $10 billion to $14 billion worth of bonds to reimburse the state's=
=20
general fund for past and future power purchases.=20
""If they did the bond issue, they'd replenish the fund, at least for the=20
short term. If they don't do it, then it's more of a concern,"" Zimmermann=
=20
said.=20
Unfortunately, the downgrade could make it harder for the state to sell the=
=20
bonds.=20
""If they could have gotten the deal done before the downgrade, they would=
=20
have had a stronger deal,"" said Kelly Mainelli, a municipal bond fund manag=
er=20
with Montgomery Asset Management.=20
California must obtain an investment-grade rating (BBB- or higher) on the=
=20
bonds before it can sell them.=20
Mainelli said California municipal bond prices have already fallen in=20
anticipation of a ratings cut. When prices fall, bond yields go up.=20
""The downgrade is the culmination of everything that's happened since early=
=20
December,"" he said.=20
In November, California municipal bonds yields were 0.4 to 0.5 percentage=
=20
points below the national average. Today, they're 0.1 to 0.2 percentage=20
points above the national average, and Mainelli thinks they could go up 0.1=
=20
to 0.2 percentage points more because of the downgrade.=20
The total difference -- about 0.7 percentage points -- doesn't sound like=
=20
much, but it adds up.=20
Last year, the state itself sold $4.6 billion in new bonds (excluding bonds=
=20
sold to replace existing bonds). If it sells the same amount this year, plu=
s=20
$12 billion in energy bonds, that 0.7 percentage point difference on $16.6=
=20
billion in bonds would cost the state $116 million a year in additional=20
interest costs.=20
Yesterday's downgrade only affected the state's general obligation bonds an=
d=20
others secured by the ""full faith and credit of the state,"" such as the=20
California Health Facilities Construction Loan Insurance Fund (Cal Mortgage=
).=20
But the energy debacle could wind up costing other municipal bond issuers i=
n=20
California -- such as cities, counties, school and water districts -- more=
=20
money when they sell bonds. Although their ratings have not changed because=
=20
of the energy crisis, analysts say the yields on most California municipal=
=20
bonds have gone up, and will go up some more, as a result of the state's=20
downgrade.=20
""The values of all California bonds will be hurt by this downgrade, whether=
=20
they should be or not. Psychologically, it's just how the market reacts,""=
=20
says Richard Goldstein, a San Ramon financial planner.=20
Investors who have to sell their California bonds on the open market before=
=20
they mature may not get all their principal back. But investors who hold=20
their bonds until maturity will probably get paid in full, Goldstein said.=
=20
No matter how bad the energy crisis gets, most experts believe the state wi=
ll=20
continue making principal and interest payments on its bonds, even if it ha=
s=20
to raise taxes, cut expenditures or run a temporary deficit to do so.=20
""There's also the prospect at some point of federal help,"" Goldstein said.=
=20
""The federal government does not want California to default or even come=20
close.=20
Do you know what that would do to the national economy and the world=20
economy?""=20
California's bond-rating history=20
S&P cut its rating on California debt yesterday for the first time since=20
1994.=20
What credit ratings mean=20
-- AAA: Extremely strong capacity to meet financial commitments.=20

Will price caps deter investment, as federal regulators say?=20

(04-25) 00:43 PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Some key power generators say=20
California's dearth of energy supplies, and its growing demand, make it a=
=20
good place to build more plants and sell more power in the years to come --=
=20
even if dreaded price caps are imposed.=20
``Regardless of what the (market) structure turns out to be, the state's=20
going to need electricity and it's going to need to buy it from somebody,''=
=20
said Bill Highlander, spokesman for San Jose-based Calpine Corp.=20
Calpine is investing about $4 billion in power plants over the next four=20
years that will generate 9,000 megawatts, enough for more than 6 million=20
homes. The state's current energy crisis ``hasn't really changed our plans =
or=20
our strategy,'' he said.=20
But Chief federal energy regulator Curtis Hebert says price caps on wholesa=
le=20
electricity will hinder, not help, California's energy crisis.=20
Energy wholesalers seeking higher prices than California is willing to pay=
=20
will invest in other states, warns Hebert, the chairman of the Federal Ener=
gy=20
Regulatory Commission. And any regulations that cut into future profits wil=
l=20
scare away desperately needed new power plants, he says.=20
Eight of the 13 new power plants approved in California already are under=
=20
construction. Twelve more are under review, according to the California=20
Energy Commission, which approves power plants.=20
CEC spokesman Rob Schlichting said that's a huge boost over the last decade=
,=20
when uncertainty over the rules of deregulation -- not a threat of price ca=
ps=20
-- kept applications down. No companies have withdrawn plans to build plant=
s=20
since December.=20
``The only way price caps would scare away investment is if they were set s=
o=20
low you couldn't make a profit,'' Schlichting said. ``It's still a market=
=20
that people seem to want to come in and produce power for.''=20
Other companies still planning to invest in California include North=20
Carolina-based Duke Energy, which has two plants in the works, and=20
Houston-based Reliant Energy, which is negotiating with the state to sell=
=20
power on long-term contracts.=20
Reliant's spokesman, Richard Wheatley, wouldn't say whether price caps alon=
e=20
would inhibit them from building more plants. What he did say is that=20
California's power politics leave a lot of room for improvement.=20
The state has considered taking over power plants through eminent domain an=
d=20
implementing a windfall profits tax to take some of their earnings away.=20
Meanwhile, Attorney General Bill Lockyer is offering a bounty for any=20
information that could prove wholesalers worked together to drive up prices=
,=20
which could lead to more lawsuits and investigations.=20
If California wants to encourage construction, it's got to tone down its=20
vilification and stop adding more restrictions, Wheatley said.=20
``Whenever we go into an area and consider building a power plant, we have =
to=20
look at the economics of the facility, we have to look at the regulatory=20
situation, esoteric things like what the mindset is like,'' he said.=20
``California is not the easiest place in which to do business.''=20
Some power companies have invested so much in pipelines, gas reserves and=
=20
plants already under construction that it's folly to turn back now.=20
``We want to build in California, but we need to have regulatory stability =
or=20
at least regulatory clarity to move these things forward because they're=20
half-billion dollar projects in some cases,'' said Tom Williams, a spokesma=
n=20
for Duke. ``That's a lot of bananas.''=20
Senators Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Gordon Smith, R-Ore., plan this we=
ek=20
to introduce legislation urging FERC to impose a temporary price cap over t=
he=20
11 Western states. They hope to keep prices down in the short-term and give=
=20
California and other troubled states a breather to make long-term decisions=
.=20
Feinstein's bill does not yet specify a price. Some economists say $150 to=
=20
$250 per megawatt hour would be just and reasonable, yet provide generators=
 a=20
profit. Prices have gone as high as $1,500 for the same amount of power in=
=20
the past year.=20
Tying the price cap to the cost of making power could make it easier for=20
generators to swallow, said Severin Borenstein, director of the University =
of=20
California, Berkeley's energy institute. Such a cap would account for=20
variables such as the wildly fluctuating cost of natural gas used to genera=
te=20
much of the energy in California's power plants.=20
Price caps can be effective, but only if they are very carefully designed,=
=20
warned Frank Wolak, chairman of the Independent System Operator's market=20
surveillance committee. The ISO manages the state's power grid.=20
Set them too high, and companies will only bid that amount, saving little=
=20
money, Wolak said. Too low, and the generators could choose to sell elsewhe=
re=20
unless all other nearby states have the same price limits.=20
Also, capping the most expensive energy sales -- power sold on the spot=20
market at times of high demand -- won't lower prices for other key componen=
ts=20
of the state's energy supply, such as electricity bought for the next day's=
=20
power needs.=20
``Suppose you're paying $150 every single (megawatt) hour. That still puts =
us=20
in big trouble with wholesale energy costs,'' Wolak said.=20
The state already has spent $5.1 billion buying power for customers of=20
California's three largest investor-owned utilities, which lost their credi=
t=20
-- and thus their ability to buy power -- after paying sharply higher costs=
=20
for wholesale energy.=20
Borenstein said paying even $250 a megawatt hour is still preferable to the=
=20
unknown, particularly since economists have warned that there is virtually =
no=20
upper limit to what energy companies can charge.=20
``This summer we are going to be truly short of power and at those times th=
e=20
price is going to be at the price cap, and if we don't have a price cap, th=
ey=20
will be way above the price cap,'' Borenstein said.=20
FERC remains opposed to price caps, but after months of complaints, the boa=
rd=20
this week is considering a limited cap on the most expensive last-minute=20
power buys.=20
The proposal would cap California but not the rest of the West, and order=
=20
wholesalers to sell to the state during the most extreme power shortages.=
=20
Though it provides some cushioning, it does not address the high prices=20
California swallows the rest of the time. That's the point of Feinstein's=
=20
bill.=20
``The crisis point is this summer to next summer and we need some federal=
=20
assistance,'' said Howard Gantman, spokesman for Feinstein. ``This would=20
assure the generators a reasonable profit and continue to spur on further=
=20
investment into new plants.''=20

State bond rating lowered=20

BY JENNIFER BJORHUS=20

Mercury News=20


One of Wall Street's top credit-rating houses has downgraded California's=
=20
bonds because of the state's handling of the energy crisis, a move that cou=
ld=20
ultimately cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars.=20
Saying that mounting and uncertain power costs are likely to do lasting har=

to California's economy, New York-based Standard & Poor's on Tuesday lowere=
d=20
the state's credit rating on its ``general obligation'' bonds two notches,=
=20
from AA to A+ with a negative outlook. That puts California near the bottom=
=20
of the state bond heap with only one state -- Louisiana -- rated lower.=20
Standard & Poor's said the rating could go lower if the state cannot resolv=
e=20
the power crisis.=20
The downgrade will cost California millions of dollars in coming years=20
because a lower rating makes it more expensive for the state to issue gener=
al=20
obligation bonds to finance projects such as school construction.=20
The interest on those bonds, which will rise from an estimated 5 to perhaps=
=20
5.25 percent, is paid from the state's tax-financed general fund. Although=
=20
the rating change doesn't apply technically to the different type of bond t=

state plans to issue by June for power purchases, it will probably make tho=
se=20
bonds more expensive for the state, too, bond experts say.=20
Heightened urgency=20
``There's a sense of urgency that this problem has been escalating,=20
particularly since the PG&E bankruptcy,'' said David Hitchcock, California=
=20
analyst for Standard & Poor's. ``This problem could move quickly.''=20
At least one bond expert said the downgrade was surprising.=20
``To me it's clear that S&P doesn't have much faith in this power-bailout=
=20
plan of the Legislature and the governor. To me that's the reason they did=
=20
it,'' said Zane Mann, publisher of the monthly California Bond Advisor=20
newsletter.=20
No single new piece of information triggered the downgrade, Hitchcock said.=
=20
The major factor, he said, was simply spiraling costs and no long-term plan=
=20
for paying the bills. Last week Gov. Gray Davis said the state had been=20
spending $73 million a day to buy electricity, up from $45.8 million a day =
in=20
late March. Hitchcock said some energy traders suspect the actual costs are=
=20

All three major Wall Street credit-rating agencies have California on=20
so-called ``credit watch,'' but only Standard & Poor's has downgraded. One=
=20
municipal bond expert said Standard & Poor's had been ``trigger happy'' and=
=20
eager to downgrade. Raymond Murphy, Moody's California analyst, said he had=
=20
no immediate plans to change California's bond rating, but that he's anxiou=
s=20
to see officials produce a long-term plan for financing power purchases.=20
Murphy said he had a conference call with state officials about the issue=
=20
Tuesday morning.=20
``We want the state to develop the plan that gets the general fund out of=
=20
power purchasing,'' Murphy said.=20
The state says it's working on that, but there's a roadblock.=20
Revenue bonds=20
A major piece of the state's plan is to have the Department of Water=20
Resources issue $10 billion to $14 billion in revenue bonds to pay back the=
=20
general fund for what has been taken to buy power in recent months. But tha=
t=20
portion of the plan is tied up in a dispute between PG&E and the California=
=20
Public Utilities Commission over how to spend the extra money generated by=
=20
electricity rate increases. The dispute has also held up the $4.13 billion =
in=20

To break the logjam, officials from the state treasurer's office have asked=

revenue bonds.=20
``California's credit rating and financial strength will be in jeopardy unt=
il=20
the state's general fund is repaid for energy costs,'' state Treasurer Phil=

Angelides said in a statement Tuesday.=20
State Finance Director Tim Gage and Gov. Davis both downplayed the=20
significance of the rate change. Through a press officer, Davis said the=20
state's economy remains fundamentally strong.=20
The state was downgraded to a lower A rating in 1994 and went on to see=20
tremendous economic growth.=20
Mounting pressure=20
Still, a downgrade is bad news that sends a psychological signal in both th=

responding to the crisis.=20
``It sounds like the bond market might be out ahead of some of the=20
policy-makers in California,'' said Severin Borenstein, director of the=20
University of California Energy Institute. ``We're facing a real emergency=

here.''=20
John Hallacy, managing director of municipal research at Merrill Lynch, sai=

To Nettie Hoge, executive director of the Utility Reform Network and a=20

Q&A with Gov. Gray Davis on energy issues=20
Gov. Gray Davis visited the Mercury News editorial board Monday. On the=20
subject of electricity, Davis talked about increasing the number of power=
=20
plants, the rejection of price caps by the Federal Energy Regulatory=20
Commission, and the condition of the state's two largest utilities, Souther=
n=20
California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. Davis has proposed a deal to=
=20
rescue Edison, and the Legislature is considering it. PG&E has filed for=20
bankruptcy.=20
Here is a condensed version of Davis' remarks.=20
Q: What would you like to say by way of introduction about the state's=20
electricity problems?=20
Davis: There are really two problems. One is the amount of power available=
=20
and the other is the price of power.=20
In 2002, we'll have more megawatts on line, at least 5,000 more. By 2003,=
=20
we'll have a slight excess of power over demand. That's very important.=20
Because at the moment, we import 20 percent of our power. We have no=20
leverage. We are at the mercy of forces that show no mercy. That will never=
=20
change until we have more power than we need.=20
OK, price. As you know, the only entity that can influence the [wholesale]=
=20
price of electricity is the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.=20
Deregulation surrendered the ability of the state to do that.=20
In 1999, this state for all power, including municipal power, spent roughly=
=20
$7 billion. In 2000, we spent $32.5 billion. I don't know what it will be=
=20
this year, but it will be substantially higher.=20
Through all this the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has refused to do=
 a=20
thing, zero, zippo. Lest you think I'm being partisan, that commission=20
consists entirely of Clinton appointees.=20
The final piece is the financial consequences of what's happened to date. I=
t=20
is our hope that if we can keep Southern California Edison credit-worthy an=
d=20
able to re-enter the power purchasing market Jan. 1, 2003, we can then go t=
o=20
the PG&E creditors committee [the generators to whom PG&E owes money] and s=
ay=20
to them: ``Look at the arrangement we made with Southern California Edison.=
=20
We believe that this is a far better deal than PG&E can give you.''=20
I think this is a fair plan. We get every electron that Edison's utility ow=
ns=20
committed for 10 years, at a cost-of-service basis. Under [current law] the=
y=20
could sell that next March at market rates. We got $400 million returned fr=
om=20
the holding company, a $3 billion investment in the transmission and delive=
ry=20
systems .?.?. a permanent easement on about 20,000 acres of environmental=
=20
property around all their hydro facilities.=20
Q: Do you have in mind a finished product for the changes that are happenin=
g=20
in the electric system? What will it look like in a couple of years?=20
Davis: It is my expectation that the utilities will be purchasing the power=
=20
entirely, commencing Jan. 1, 2003. Our goal is to get them back in business=
.=20
In addition to investor-owned utilities, I believe we also need a public=20
power authority. At some point I believe the private sector will say to=20
itself, ``I want to build new plants to replace the 40-year-old plants, but=
=20
do I really want to get the state to a 15 percent margin over supply, there=
by=20
reducing the value of the electrons I already own?'' If they do, God bless=
=20
them. But if they don't, at least we'll have the opportunity to build them=
=20
ourselves.=20
Once we have even a slight margin of capacity over demand, the spot market=
=20
prices will come down dramatically.=20
Q: You said in February that you could have solved the electricity problem =
in=20
20 minutes if you'd been willing to raise rates. Now, rates are going to be=
=20
raised. Should you have favored a rate increase earlier?=20
Davis: I should have been more specific. I should have said I could have=20
solved it in 20 minutes if I wanted to triple rates. I think the rate=20
increase I proposed is fair. It rewards people who are the most energy=20
efficient, the people who only use up to 130 percent of their baseline. The=
y=20
are approximately half the state. So half the state will see no rate=20
increase, beyond the 10 percent that everyone saw in January.=20
Q: Is the state willing to spend anything it costs to keep the lights on, o=
r=20
at some point, would it stiff the generators and just say we will accept a=
=20
blackout?=20
Davis: We have to provide power. There are many people who have medical=20
devices that have to keep running. Blackouts can cause deaths, traffic=20
accidents, all kinds of calamities that I wouldn't want to happen.=20
I'm reluctant to tell the generators we'll pay any price, so I'm not going =
to=20
say we'll pay absolutely any price, but my bias obviously is to find a way =
to=20
keep the lights on.=20
Q: When will you reveal how much electricity the state has bought, from wha=
t=20
companies, at what prices and what this will cost the state this year and i=
n=20
coming years?=20
Davis: We'll reveal an awful lot of information as soon as the bonds go to=
=20
market. [The state plans a bond issue to cover the upfront costs of=20
purchasing electricity.] That information has to be made public. That will=
=20
probably be in less than two months.=20
Believe me, I don't like going around getting beat up for hiding informatio=
n.=20
I'm doing it for one reason only, which is that I know every additional edg=
e=20
I give the generators will result in higher prices for customers.=20
Q: There's an impression that the state budget is being drained by the powe=
r=20
crisis. Is that right?=20
Davis: The simple answer to that is no, because the state will be fully=20
reimbursed with interest as soon as these bonds are sold.=20
At the moment, in the short term, it is crowding out other spending. But I=
=20
think everyone understands that's a temporary phenomenon, until the state i=
s=20
reimbursed by bonds that are repaid over time through the rate structure th=
at=20
I proposed.=20
Q: Would it be your pledge that ratepayers, not taxpayers, will fully repay=
=20
the state's cost in purchasing electricity?=20
Davis: That is the assumption underlying these bonds. That's right as it=20
relates to electricity, but obviously the conservation incentives came out =
of=20
the general fund.=20
Q: Have you talked to President Bush about this?=20
Davis: I hear all these rumors as to why the Bush administration doesn't wa=
nt=20
to be helpful, but this state, and particularly this region, has been=20
disproportionately helpful in America's economic growth and technological=
=20
productivity. If he wants America to grow, it behooves him to keep Californ=
ia=20
growing. To date, I think it's fair to say that of my public requests,=20
President Bush has been responsive to all but the price caps.=20

SACRAMENTO -- Even as power grid operators warned the state's lights could=

Power Companies and Regulators Must Take Steps To Avoid Spread of=20
California Power Virus/ Andersen Analysis



WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 24, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -
A ""new virus spawned
in California"" poses formidable challenges requiring new strategies on
the part of power companies, regulators and policymakers to contain
and reverse its damage, according to ""Energy Crisis in the Western
United States: Lessons for Navigating Regulatory and Market
Minefields,"" a new Andersen report released today.


""The implications for the development of competitive energy
markets go far beyond the Western United States,"" Andersen's national
utility practice head Matthew D. Smith told a Washington briefing.
""Unfortunately, California has taught the nation that regulatory and
political barriers can create and sustain an energy crisis.""


""California has demonstrated that the risks in the electricity
industry, if not properly acknowledged and managed, can simultaneously
and profoundly impact all market participants. To be effectively
managed, these risks need to be exposed, assumed or shared, measured
and monitored. When they are hidden or ignored, all parties can
potentially suffer. A shared, integrated view of these risks, and a
strategy for their assumption and management, is critical to avoiding
rapid value destruction within the energy market,"" Smith said.


An Andersen survey of senior utility executives outside
California, also released at the briefing, indicates most utility
companies believe they inoculated themselves against the California
virus so that it is unlikely to affect their operations beyond slowing
the pace of deregulation and increasing investor scrutiny. However,
based on the potential implications it sees of the California
situation, Andersen believes a series of booster shots are advisable
for power companies and regulators. ""To deliver reliable service at a
predictable cost in today's environment, companies must focus on
market integration by developing new and innovative relationships
between suppliers, customers, employees and investors -- while working
with government officials and regulators to chart a smoother
transition to a deregulated power market,"" according to Smith.


Eight Implications


The Andersen report identified eight overriding implications
emanating from the Western energy crisis that are shaping the
longer-term operations of the Western grid, the regional and national
economy, domestic energy policy and the industry's evolution:


1.  Increased deregulation uncertainty and risk -- Tension and


differences between state and federal regulators raise the


specter of repeating the regulatory and political conundrum


California's investor-owned utilities have faced. If federal


initiatives open wholesale markets while retail markets remain


regulated, a crucial question is raised: Will state regulators


pass-through higher wholesale costs if they should


materialize? Tensions between state and federal regulators


over policies on deregulation will grow if states delay or


abandon retail competition.


As wholesale markets are deregulated and RTOs begin operating,


the prudence principles that state regulators have used for


many years may have to be changed. For example, if FERC and


RTO monitors determine that deregulated wholesale markets


operate fairly, prices derived from those markets must be


considered reasonable. If so, these costs should be allowed


into state-regulated retail rates without regard to the


prudence principles state regulators have used for years.


Therefore, utilities' traditional burden of proving costs are


or are not justifiable shifts to regulators.


2.  Reduced investor confidence -- Prior to deregulation,


stringent prudence review and disallowance of generation costs


in the rate base made regulatory risk largely uncontrollable,


killing IOU interests in most new investment. A major purpose


of deregulation was to create an environment in which risk


could be managed, but California's political and regulatory


environment provides only a limited ability to manage risks.


The confidence and perceptions needed to support investment


decision-making will be slow to return given the approach of


the state to remedy the crisis.


3.  Contributing factor in economic softening -- Uncertain energy


reliability and higher costs can drive-out marginal


businesses, cause healthy companies to constrain expansion,


and lead new entrants to question whether to make new


investments. As such, an extended energy crisis contributes to


inflation pressures and may slow economic growth.


4.  Increased pressure on the Western grid -- Even as capacity


increases and demand reductions work to resolve the California


crisis, these solutions have long-term implications for the


Western Grid. These include a realistic possibility of


California becoming an ""energy island"" as a result of


near-term reduction in available regional resources for export


to California; increased emphasis on security control to


protect against overall Western grid failure as sub-regions


have problems; RTO requirements to strengthen locally


available supplies to bolster overall system reliability;


longer-term development of new plants using plentiful coal


resources and clean coal technology will alter the pattern of


imports into California; and the emergence of Mexico as a


major supplier to southern California and Arizona,


contributing to a bifurcation of the Western Grid into


northern and southern markets.


5.  Unbundling failures that push companies back to portfolio


strategies -- For California investor-owned utilities,


unbundling has achieved neither the least-cost solution sought


by regulators nor value maximization targeted by investors.


This necessitates a reevaluation of portfolio management


strategies potentially involving generation, transmission,


power trading and marketing, and retail businesses in multiple


geographies serving multiple markets.


6.  Ineffectiveness in changing siting and development


restrictions -- California's retail price caps and multiple


explanations for the crisis have left accelerated siting


processes and environmental standards changes open to


challenge by various interests. In addition, limiting


application of new siting orders only to small generators


contributes to uncertainty and investor hesitancy.


7.  Procurement management that alters user-utility negotiating


leverage -- Competitive markets compel participants --


suppliers, marketers, large industrial buyers, etc. -- to


strategically manage procurement as a critical value-driver.


Because risk is explicitly shared and always has the potential


of shifting advantage to either seller or buyer, the


sophistication of negotiations and contracts increases as


competitive markets evolve.


8.  Increased emphasis on distributed generation and new


technologies -- California's reliability and price challenges


have triggered a re-emergence of energy crisis measures from


the 1970s. End-users are investing in solutions they control,


and the distributed generation market is being aggressively


developed among large retailers, industrial users and


residential customers. This makes possible the development of


microgrids connecting consumers in local areas and related


changes in traditional grid systems, from modifications in


interconnection agreements to changing definitions of reserve


margins and system reliability.


Industry Executives' Response


Senior executives from sixteen non-California utilities with a
combined market capitalization over $120 billion and $145 billion in
revenues responded to an Andersen survey with their views of the
implications of the California power crisis for their companies and
for the industry. The survey, conducted between February 19, 2001 and
March 2, 2001 by Knowledge Systems &amp; Research, Inc. of Syracuse, found
that the companies are observing the California situation carefully,
expect a slowing -- but not a turnaround -- of deregulation, and
believe their internal plans and preparations are on-target for the
changing environment:


--  Deregulation -- Nearly all executives believe recent


California events will slow the pace of deregulation over the


next five years for states that have not begun or finished


writing restructuring legislation. None believe that it will


cause advanced states to re-regulate markets, although many


states will review their legislation to assess their risk of


duplicating California's current situation and make any


changes necessary to avoid it.


--  National legislation -- Few executives suggest the situation


will initiate national energy policy/legislation; others


believe it will be a continuing issue but, because of


state-to-state variances, Congress will be unable to pass any


comprehensive measures or force states to a restructuring


timeline. Some expect additional state-level legislation.


--  Company strategies -- Most do not see any changes to their


business models or strategies for generation, distribution or


supply procurement as a response to the situation in


California. However, many have expanded their risk management


programs, reduced spot market purchases, begun emphasizing


long-term supply contracts, planning new power generation


capacity, and started hedging with futures trades. Those


facing price caps are rethinking their stance on them.


--  Investor scrutiny -- Many executives indicate their


shareholders are aware of the situation and investors --


particularly institutional investors -- are more heavily


scrutinizing their actions. Many say news coverage has


prompted retail, commercial and industrial customer skepticism


of industry restructuring.


--  Transmission deregulation -- Many executives agree the


California situation will increase interest in FERC's regional


transmission organizations (RTO) deregulation effort.


Utility Company Action Items


Both to guard against a sudden California cascade and as a
potentially powerful competitive thrust, forward-thinking utilities
should bolster their basic preparedness with a variety of tactics --
or inoculations -- specifically aimed to combat a potential California
power virus, according to Andersen partner Mark Moskovitz:


--  Improve procurement management and risk management


capabilities -- To manage exposure to volatile supply and


demand shifts, organizations must be sure that comprehensive


and clear supply procedures, controls, decision points, risk


limits and communications are in place.


--  Plan and design innovative rate and pricing structures --


Companies and regulators must focus on communicating price


signals that create value for both the customer and the


provider. Innovative rate and pricing structures that more


closely tie the customer's price to the real cost of supply


will better signal the value of the service as well as


providing more accurate information upon which both end user


and supplier can make decisions.


--  Increase emphasis on demand side management (DSM) strategies


-- In addition to new pricing strategies to help achieve and


maintain supply-demand equilibrium, companies must now focus


on employing more extensive and innovative demand side


management programs. These programs may offer significant


benefits with limited risk to both the customer and energy


supplier.


--  Assess the supply and generation dynamics in adjacent


jurisdictions -- Companies must take a broader view -- beyond


typical geographic market definitions -- of the economics of


generation and related business decisions in an increasingly


volatile market in which supply will follow the best prices.


--  Develop contingency plans for the continued deferral of new


generation capacity -- In the face of potential ongoing


generation capacity shortages, companies and regulators must


be prepared to move with a portfolio of strategies to meet


demand, including for example DSM, flexible pricing and


distributed generation. In addition, they should explore


efficiency-improving upgrades to existing facilities and seize


any opportunity to accelerate near-term construction plans.


--  Proactively address potential organizational disruption -- As


regulatory and economic changes continue to churn the industry


waters and companies adjust and/or restructure, they must be


highly cogniscent of, sensitive to, and directly address


employees' concerns with information about the company's


future and theirs'.


Industry/Regulatory Lessons


There are also a number of broad primary lessons the electric
power industry -- nationally and internationally -- should take away
from its first major domestic test case in deregulation and
restructuring, according to Andersen principal David O. Jermain:


--  Simplify market design.


--  Build a continuing role for regulators.


--  Maintain communications with multiple constituent interests.


--  Prepare contingency plans for extreme stress conditions.


--  Couple real-time retail pricing with transparently priced


wholesale competition.


--  Provide special incentives for RTO investment, formation and


development.


--  Break down regulatory and political barriers to market signals


and responses.

Soaring Temperatures Produce Call for Conservation;=20
California ISO Also Announces New Outage Notification System and On-call=20
Number



FOLSOM, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 24, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -
As the mercury
climbs this week, the California Independent System Operator
(California ISO) is reminding consumers to curb their electricity use
in order to minimize the strain on the power grid. The first warm
spell of the season is expected to cause temperatures to jump 10
degrees, leading to a 2,000 megawatt increase in electricity
consumption -- the equivalent of two large power plants. The week
started out with a peak demand of 28,835 megawatts, but by tomorrow it
is forecasted to top 30,500 megawatts. This comes as hydroelectricity
resources (both Northwest and California) run low, more than 10,000
megawatts of power plants remain off line due to planned and unplanned
maintenance, and some 3,000 megawatts of Qualifying Facilities or
alternative energy suppliers are not operating.


The California ISO's renewed call for conservation precedes a
forecast of 90 degree highs in the inland areas that may tempt many
Californians to flip on air conditioners. For conservation tips --
such as using fans instead of air conditioners, setting thermostat at
78 degrees, etc. -- please see the California ISO's web site
www.caiso.com.


New Notification System:


With a challenging summer around the corner, the California ISO
wants to do all it can to bring information to the public as quickly
as possible. For that reason, a new notification system is being
brought on line. Media and the public can now access the Internet to
keep current if rotating blackouts are issued.


Navigation:


Visit www.caiso.com


Click on System Conditions for current information on rotating


outages (will appear only when activated) For previous outage


information (last hour, etc.), click on Market Notices, scroll to


bottom of page and click on Notice Log


The California ISO is also testing a new service to notify
newsrooms immediately by email should the ISO initiate electrical
emergencies (Stage One - Three) or rotating outages. If you would like
to participate, please email kwerst@caiso.com with a maximum of one
email address per newsroom.


Additionally, a single on-call media pager number has been
established: 916/815-0679. To make it easier on media, ISO
Communications will no longer be posting on-call schedules for media
spokespersons on the web site. Simply call the on-call pager after
hours.


News releases alerting the media to electrical emergencies will
continue, as will news conferences held on-site in Folsom and via
telephone. As a reminder, if you wish to visit the ISO control rooms
(in Folsom or Alhambra) always call ISO Communications first at
888/516-NEWS to make an appointment. Access to the control rooms may
be limited on certain days, depending on system conditions and/or
level of requests from media.

PELTZ, Times Staff Writer=20 ?????A debate now rages in California over whether price controls should be= =20 adopted to stem the state's soaring power costs and help consumers who are= =20 bracing for huge spikes in their electric bills. ?????But price controls are one of the most controversial actions in=20 economics--and in politics, for that matter. And now the caps are more in= =20 dispute than ever because they run counter to the nation's move over the la= st=20 two decades to deregulate more and more industries, from airlines to=20 railroads to energy. ?????Yet California is a good example of deregulation gone haywire, so=20 controls are again being demanded by lawmakers, consumer advocates and othe= rs=20 as a way to check surging prices. On the other side is a chorus of critics= =20 who ridicule price caps as being ineffective and, at times, making matters= =20 worse for consumers. ?????Case in point: the Golden State itself, which tried last summer to use= =20 temporary price caps to keep a lid on skyrocketing wholesale electricity=20 prices. ?????Critics claim that the caps drove power sales out of state, thus=20 widening the imbalance between supply and demand, reinforcing the existing= =20 shortages and contributing to this winter's rolling blackouts. ?????But defenders of the caps note that the dysfunctional California marke= t=20 had no way to self-correct. The utilities couldn't simply refuse to buy=20 electricity in the face of higher prices, and with no price ceiling in sigh= t,=20 something had to be done. ?????And now Gov. Gray Davis and others are again calling for temporary=20 controls until more electricity supplies can be added, especially as the=20 state enters the peak-power summer season. On Tuesday, Sens. Dianne Feinste= in=20 (D-Calif.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) introduced legislation that would impo= se=20 price controls on wholesale energy throughout 11 Western states. ?????Mindful of the controversial history of controls, Feinstein and Smith= =20 stressed that the caps would last only through March 1, 2003. But they also= =20 argued that the economic damage to industries and consumers from escalating= =20 power costs would exceed any harm caused by price controls. ?????""I have a strong preference for markets, but it's a mistake to believe= =20 that we have a free market when it comes to energy,"" said Smith, the only G= OP=20 co-sponsor of the legislation. ?????Their bill would require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, whi= ch=20 regulates U.S. wholesale electricity prices, either to impose a regional=20 price cap or institute a rate schedule for each power generator, tying the= =20 price of electricity to the cost of producing it. ?????Coincidentally, FERC today is expected to decide on various other=20 proposals to again limit California's power costs--but without explicitly= =20 stating that the plans include price controls. Why? Because the Bush=20 administration and FERC Chairman Curt Hebert Jr., among others, are on the= =20 record as adamantly opposing price caps. ?????That's not surprising. Price controls often are tagged as a liberal=20 maneuver that flies in the face of conservatives' free-market ideology. Yet= ,=20 ironically, hanging over the California debate is the legacy of a Republica= n=20 president who was the last one to mandate price controls on a nationwide=20 level: Richard M. Nixon. ?????The late president took that rare step 30 years ago this August to try= =20 to quell inflation and spark an economic rebound. His actions were so=20 dramatic that they are still invoked by those wanting to criticize or, in= =20 some cases, endorse setting limits on prices. ?????""What he did is almost larger than life now,"" said Shannon Burchett,= =20 chief executive of RiskLimited Corp., a strategic consulting firm in Dallas= . ?????Nixon's controls were the most far-reaching since World War II, when= =20 prices were capped so that profiteers couldn't reap huge sums for scarce=20 commodities being used for the war and simultaneously rationed at home. ?????In most cases, price controls have been much less sweeping and targete= d=20 at specific products or services. They don't always involve changing the la= w,=20 either. In 1962, President Kennedy publicly rebuked the then-U.S. Steel Cor= p.=20 and its chairman, Roger Blough, for starting an industrywide move to raise= =20 steel prices. The price hikes were rolled back a few days later. ?????Since Nixon, price controls have become rarer as industries that were= =20 once regulated--which means their prices were government-controlled--have= =20 been deregulated. ?????So it is in California, where electric utilities' prices were controll= ed=20 for decades until the state's deregulation law in 1996. But now that the la= w=20 has been blamed for the soaring wholesale prices, power shortages, crippled= =20 utilities and the need for a huge jump in ratepayers' costs, some again wan= t=20 price controls on electricity until the crisis eases. ?????Which brings everyone back to Nixon. ?????Some Nixon Controls Were Lifted by Reagan ?????""I've heard people make the analogy to what happened . . . when Nixon= =20 put on controls,"" but in California ""this is fundamentally different,"" said= =20 Mike Florio, a board member of the California Independent System Operator,= =20 which oversees most of the state's electricity grid. ?????""When you get into a situation of shortage [of supplies], there is=20 really no restraint at all on prices,"" said Florio, who said he normally=20 prefers unfettered markets but also defended the state's caps last summer.= =20 Such government intervention ""on a temporary basis is better than nothing,= =20 but I don't think it's ideal."" ?????The reverberations from Nixon's fiat aren't just felt in California=20 either. When New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani recently proposed more stringe= nt=20 controls on wholesale electricity costs in New York state, critics promptly= =20 pointed to Nixon's controls. ""They were a disaster,"" one columnist wrote. ?????Even Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who was in the private= =20 sector in the early 1970s, turned down several requests to take high-level= =20 White House jobs in part because he was disgusted with Nixon's price contro= ls. ?????Many economists and historians also judge Nixon's controls as a mistak= e.=20 But some maintain that his decision--which began with a 90-day freeze on=20 prices, wages and rents--wasn't entirely a failure and even provided ""shock= =20 value"" that, for a while at least, arrested higher inflation. ?????In addition, part of Nixon's move involved taking the dollar off the= =20 gold standard--which in effect meant its price was controlled--and letting = it=20 float in value against other major currencies. And that, many believe, is t= he=20 base upon which today's global financial markets operate. ?????Others disagree. ?????""There really isn't an example of where they've [price controls]=20 worked,"" said Robert Goldberg, a senior fellow at the National Center for= =20 Policy Analysis, a nonpartisan think tank in New York. ?????""Controls always lead to an underproduction"" of the commodity involved= =20 because producers don't have any incentive to spend more on additional=20 output, he said. When the caps ultimately are lifted, prices typically soar= =20 anyway as producers move to quickly recoup the profit they lost when the=20 controls were in place, Goldberg added. ?????Others note that although most of Nixon's price controls lasted only a= =20 couple of years, various forms of controls over crude oil and natural gas= =20 lasted for another decade until they were removed by President Ronald Reaga= n. ?????In the meantime, the controls--aggravated by embargoes and other suppl= y=20 cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries--distorted the fr= ee=20 market for energy, critics say. The controls kept U.S. oil prices=20 artificially low, which in turn kept demand for oil high, giving OPEC more= =20 power over world production and prices in the 1970s, they contend. ?????Nonetheless, proponents keep calling for controls when prices for=20 certain items seem to be spiraling out of control. ?????Critics Say Controls Worsen the Problems ?????President Clinton's massive health-reform proposal in the early 1990s= =20 included price controls on drugs. But the idea set off howls of protest fro= m=20 the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, and ultimately the entire= =20 proposal was shelved. Consumer advocates and others also demanded federal= =20 controls on rising cable TV rates in 1997 and 1998, again contending that t= he=20 cable operators were hiking prices at a much faster rate than inflation.=20 Cable firms were allowed to keep passing certain costs on to their=20 subscribers, but specific price caps weren't enacted. ?????But proponents of temporary price controls on California power emphasi= ze=20 that electricity isn't in the same category as an airplane seat, steel or= =20 other commodities that don't have to be bought if the price soars too high. ?????""In soybeans maybe the market can adjust quickly"" to changes in supply= =20 and demand, ""but in electric generation in California it can't,"" said Flori= o,=20 who also serves as an attorney for the Utility Reform Network, a consumer= =20 group. ""For most products, one of the ways prices get determined is if buye= rs=20 refuse to buy when the price gets too high. But that's generally not an=20 option for people when it comes to electricity."" ?????Critics of California's attempt to cap prices last summer said the=20 controls instead prompted many power suppliers to sell their electricity to= =20 other states. That ""actually made the tight-supply problem worse [in=20 California] by driving imports out of the state,"" the Bay Area Economic=20 Forum, a research group funded by regional business and government agencies= ,=20 said in a report last week. ?????Indeed, the temporary caps were basically abandoned by year's end to= =20 keep enough electricity in the state. ?????Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economics professor who heads the= =20 Independent System Operator's market surveillance committee, said there are= =20 ways to mitigate the state's power prices without having to set rigid=20 controls. One proposal: Have FERC require that generators supply 75% of the= ir=20 expected future sales to California under long-term contracts at ""just and= =20 reasonable"" prices set by the federal agency, he said. ?????That would ""send the right [price] signal to suppliers to come into th= e=20 state,"" Wolak said. ?????And because it will take time for California to get more of its own=20 power-generating plants up and running, the state's electricity crisis isn'= t=20 unlike a natural disaster in which ""normal public service is disrupted"" and= =20 short-term controls serve a purpose, Florio said. ?????""Over time, market forces will work"" and controls shouldn't be need, h= e=20 said.

""It is a tough= =20 decision."" ?????Not so for Ignacio Troncoso, director of Glendale Water & Power. ""Ther= e=20 is a pretty decent trade-off, helping our neighbors in the state to keep=20 their lights on,"" he said. ?????A USC specialist warned that increased power plant emissions raise the= =20 risks of asthma and other lung ailments in the young and old. ?????""There is a potential for more emergency room visits, more people seei= ng=20 their doctors and more hospitalizations this summer,"" said Dr. Henry Gong,= =20 professor of medicine and a specialist in the health effects of air polluti= on. ?????With extended hours, the Glendale generators are emitting as much as 9= 95=20 pounds of pollutants into the air during peak demand, more than double the= =20 old limit of 390 pounds a day, city and air-quality officials said. ?????The other 14 power plants in Southern California also have more than= =20 doubled their overall emissions, according to preliminary figures from the= =20 South Coast Air Quality Management District. As a group, the plants emitted= a=20 total of 2,045 tons of smog-forming nitrogen oxide in the first three month= s=20 of 2001, compared with 905 tons for the same period last year. ?????The AQMD hearing board on Tuesday eased pollution controls so Glendale= =20 may continue to generate excess electricity for sale to the energy-starved= =20 state. Under the plan, Glendale may run three of its old steam boilers=20 around-the-clock to meet the state's energy demand. Usually, these boilers,= =20 hidden behind a tall brick wall, sit idle except during the peak summer=20 demand because they are inefficient and costly. ?????Glendale, like Burbank and the Los Angeles Department of Water and=20 Power, continues to produce electricity at its city-owned plant. The three= =20 cities opted against participating in a scheme of deregulation, a decision= =20 that has shielded their residents, by and large, from the huge utility rate= =20 hikes and rolling power outages experienced elsewhere. But they also will= =20 contribute to easing the state's energy emergency in the dirtier air they= =20 will be forced to breathe. ?????Air-quality officials said power plants contribute just about 3% of th= e=20 900 tons of pollution emitted into the air daily, with about 70% of the=20 pollution coming from vehicles, not factories. And in recent years, many of= =20 the region's municipal power generators have been updated with=20 pollution-control devices that reduce emissions. ?????Glendale's three steam generators, built between 1953 and 1963, are=20 inefficient by today's standards, but they are 85% cleaner since the city= =20 pumped millions of dollars into upgrades. They will be even cleaner, city= =20 officials say, with more retrofitting. ?????Under the plan, Glendale must reinvest profits from energy sales,=20 estimated at $3 million to $5 million this year, in equipment to reduce=20 future emissions at the plant and in community-based programs, such as mobi= le=20 asthma clinics and programs to reduce school bus emissions. ?????The city plans to sell as much as 50 megawatts of power, enough to ser= ve=20 50,000 homes. Under the decision Tuesday, pollution limits resume Jan. 1,= =20 2002, or when the energy emergency ends. ?????In Los Angeles, power officials said they don't expect to exceed AQMD= =20 caps, because they are adding pollution controls at two of the city's four= =20 power plants. Although they will produce more electricity, they should not= =20 produce any more nitrogen oxide, which in sunlight and heat form ozone, sai= d=20 Angelina Galiteva, LADWP's director of strategic planning. ?????""We will have much cleaner equipment in place by June,"" she said. ?????Even the environmentalists are trying to balance the risks. ?????""We realize we have a problem this summer. We have to run these plants= ,""=20 said Sheryl Carter, a senior policy analyst for the National Resources=20 Defense Council. ?????Carter said natural-gas-powered generators, like the ones in Glendale,= =20 are ""a far superior solution to diesel generators,"" which produce 50 to 100= =20 times the emissions and would be turned on in businesses across the state i= f=20 energy is unavailable from other sources. ?????""We are trying to make sure the environment overall is made whole,"" sh= e=20 said. ?????Carl Zichella, regional staff director for the Sierra Club, said the= =20 generators should be run as a last resort.

""These are big, big things."" ?????For now, residents say they are bracing for more noise, smoke and=20 disruption. ?????To begin with, AES' proposal calls for 20 hours a day of nonstop=20 construction to get the two mothballed generators in service by July. ?????Then there are the sizzling summer temperatures. Residents usually ope= n=20 their windows to let the ocean breezes cool their homes. But the noise and= =20 smells from the plants may make that impossible. ?????""It's going to be bad.

Others= =20 have remodeled their homes to obstruct ugly views. The Mortimers grew tall= =20 trees and trained vines past the windows. ?????The problems, they say, began with the energy crisis. ?????The plant was owned by Edison until 1998, when it was sold to=20 AES--California's largest private electricity producer--at the dawn of=20 deregulation. ?????The two gas-fired boilers that AES wants to restart have been dormant= =20 since 1995 and were slated for demolition until the power crisis struck. ?????But a few months ago as rolling blackouts hit the state, Gov.

Gray Davis on energy issues=20 Gov. Gray Davis visited the Mercury News editorial board Monday. On the=20 subject of electricity, Davis talked about increasing the number of power= =20 plants, the rejection of price caps by the Federal Energy Regulatory=20 Commission, and the condition of the state's two largest utilities, Souther= n=20 California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. Davis has proposed a deal to= =20 rescue Edison, and the Legislature is considering it. PG&E has filed for=20 bankruptcy.=20 Here is a condensed version of Davis' remarks.=20 Q: What would you like to say by way of introduction about the state's=20 electricity problems?=20 Davis: There are really two problems. One is the amount of power available= =20 and the other is the price of power.=20 In 2002, we'll have more megawatts on line, at least 5,000 more. By 2003,= =20 we'll have a slight excess of power over demand. That's very important.=20 Because at the moment, we import 20 percent of our power. We have no=20 leverage. We are at the mercy of forces that show no mercy. That will never= =20 change until we have more power than we need.=20 OK, price. As you know, the only entity that can influence the [wholesale]= =20 price of electricity is the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.=20 Deregulation surrendered the ability of the state to do that.=20 In 1999, this state for all power, including municipal power, spent roughly= =20 $7 billion. In 2000, we spent $32.5 billion. I don't know what it will be= =20 this year, but it will be substantially higher.=20 Through all this the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has refused to do= a=20 thing, zero, zippo. Lest you think I'm being partisan, that commission=20 consists entirely of Clinton appointees.=20 The final piece is the financial consequences of what's happened to date. I= t=20 is our hope that if we can keep Southern California Edison credit-worthy an= d=20 able to re-enter the power purchasing market Jan. 1, 2003, we can then go t= o=20 the PG&E creditors committee [the generators to whom PG&E owes money] and s= ay=20 to them: ``Look at the arrangement we made with Southern California Edison.= =20 We believe that this is a far better deal than PG&E can give you.''=20 I think this is a fair plan. We get every electron that Edison's utility ow= ns=20 committed for 10 years, at a cost-of-service basis. Under [current law] the= y=20 could sell that next March at market rates. We got $400 million returned fr= om=20 the holding company, a $3 billion investment in the transmission and delive= ry=20 systems .?.?. a permanent easement on about 20,000 acres of environmental= =20 property around all their hydro facilities.=20 Q: Do you have in mind a finished product for the changes that are happenin= g=20 in the electric system? What will it look like in a couple of years?=20 Davis: It is my expectation that the utilities will be purchasing the power= =20 entirely, commencing Jan. 1, 2003. Our goal is to get them back in business= .=20 In addition to investor-owned utilities, I believe we also need a public=20 power authority. At some point I believe the private sector will say to=20 itself, ``I want to build new plants to replace the 40-year-old plants, but= =20 do I really want to get the state to a 15 percent margin over supply, there= by=20 reducing the value of the electrons I already own?'' If they do, God bless= =20 them. But if they don't, at least we'll have the opportunity to build them= =20 ourselves.=20 Once we have even a slight margin of capacity over demand, the spot market= =20 prices will come down dramatically.=20 Q: You said in February that you could have solved the electricity problem = in=20 20 minutes if you'd been willing to raise rates. Now, rates are going to be= =20 raised. Should you have favored a rate increase earlier?=20 Davis: I should have been more specific. I should have said I could have=20 solved it in 20 minutes if I wanted to triple rates. I think the rate=20 increase I proposed is fair. It rewards people who are the most energy=20 efficient, the people who only use up to 130 percent of their baseline. The= y=20 are approximately half the state. So half the state will see no rate=20 increase, beyond the 10 percent that everyone saw in January.=20 Q: Is the state willing to spend anything it costs to keep the lights on, o= r=20 at some point, would it stiff the generators and just say we will accept a= =20 blackout?=20 Davis: We have to provide power. There are many people who have medical=20 devices that have to keep running. Blackouts can cause deaths, traffic=20 accidents, all kinds of calamities that I wouldn't want to happen.=20 I'm reluctant to tell the generators we'll pay any price, so I'm not going = to=20 say we'll pay absolutely any price, but my bias obviously is to find a way = to=20 keep the lights on.=20 Q: When will you reveal how much electricity the state has bought, from wha= t=20 companies, at what prices and what this will cost the state this year and i= n=20 coming years?=20 Davis: We'll reveal an awful lot of information as soon as the bonds go to= =20 market. [The state plans a bond issue to cover the upfront costs of=20 purchasing electricity.] That information has to be made public. That will= =20 probably be in less than two months.=20 Believe me, I don't like going around getting beat up for hiding informatio= n.=20 I'm doing it for one reason only, which is that I know every additional edg= e=20 I give the generators will result in higher prices for customers.=20 Q: There's an impression that the state budget is being drained by the powe= r=20 crisis. Is that right?=20 Davis: The simple answer to that is no, because the state will be fully=20 reimbursed with interest as soon as these bonds are sold.=20 At the moment, in the short term, it is crowding out other spending. But I= =20 think everyone understands that's a temporary phenomenon, until the state i= s=20 reimbursed by bonds that are repaid over time through the rate structure th= at=20 I proposed.=20 Q: Would it be your pledge that ratepayers, not taxpayers, will fully repay= =20 the state's cost in purchasing electricity?=20 Davis: That is the assumption underlying these bonds. That's right as it=20 relates to electricity, but obviously the conservation incentives came out = of=20 the general fund.=20 Q: Have you talked to President Bush about this?=20 Davis: I hear all these rumors as to why the Bush administration doesn't wa= nt=20 to be helpful, but this state, and particularly this region, has been=20 disproportionately helpful in America's economic growth and technological= =20 productivity. If he wants America to grow, it behooves him to keep Californ= ia=20 growing.

""The implications for the development of competitive energy markets go far beyond the Western United States,"" Andersen's national utility practice head Matthew D. Smith told a Washington briefing. ""Unfortunately, California has taught the nation that regulatory and political barriers can create and sustain an energy crisis."" ""California has demonstrated that the risks in the electricity industry, if not properly acknowledged and managed, can simultaneously and profoundly impact all market participants. To be effectively managed, these risks need to be exposed, assumed or shared, measured and monitored. When they are hidden or ignored, all parties can potentially suffer. A shared, integrated view of these risks, and a strategy for their assumption and management, is critical to avoiding rapid value destruction within the energy market,"" Smith said. An Andersen survey of senior utility executives outside California, also released at the briefing, indicates most utility companies believe they inoculated themselves against the California virus so that it is unlikely to affect their operations beyond slowing the pace of deregulation and increasing investor scrutiny. However, based on the potential implications it sees of the California situation, Andersen believes a series of booster shots are advisable for power companies and regulators. ""To deliver reliable service at a predictable cost in today's environment, companies must focus on market integration by developing new and innovative relationships between suppliers, customers, employees and investors -- while working with government officials and regulators to chart a smoother transition to a deregulated power market,"" according to Smith. Eight Implications The Andersen report identified eight overriding implications emanating from the Western energy crisis that are shaping the longer-term operations of the Western grid, the regional and national economy, domestic energy policy and the industry's evolution: 1. Increased deregulation uncertainty and risk -- Tension and differences between state and federal regulators raise the specter of repeating the regulatory and political conundrum California's investor-owned utilities have faced. If federal initiatives open wholesale markets while retail markets remain regulated, a crucial question is raised: Will state regulators pass-through higher wholesale costs if they should materialize? Tensions between state and federal regulators over policies on deregulation will grow if states delay or abandon retail competition. As wholesale markets are deregulated and RTOs begin operating, the prudence principles that state regulators have used for many years may have to be changed. For example, if FERC and RTO monitors determine that deregulated wholesale markets operate fairly, prices derived from those markets must be considered reasonable. If so, these costs should be allowed into state-regulated retail rates without regard to the prudence principles state regulators have used for years. Therefore, utilities' traditional burden of proving costs are or are not justifiable shifts to regulators. 2. Reduced investor confidence -- Prior to deregulation, stringent prudence review and disallowance of generation costs in the rate base made regulatory risk largely uncontrollable, killing IOU interests in most new investment. A major purpose of deregulation was to create an environment in which risk could be managed, but California's political and regulatory environment provides only a limited ability to manage risks. The confidence and perceptions needed to support investment decision-making will be slow to return given the approach of the state to remedy the crisis. 3. Contributing factor in economic softening -- Uncertain energy reliability and higher costs can drive-out marginal businesses, cause healthy companies to constrain expansion, and lead new entrants to question whether to make new investments. As such, an extended energy crisis contributes to inflation pressures and may slow economic growth. 4. Increased pressure on the Western grid -- Even as capacity increases and demand reductions work to resolve the California crisis, these solutions have long-term implications for the Western Grid. These include a realistic possibility of California becoming an ""energy island"" as a result of near-term reduction in available regional resources for export to California; increased emphasis on security control to protect against overall Western grid failure as sub-regions have problems; RTO requirements to strengthen locally available supplies to bolster overall system reliability; longer-term development of new plants using plentiful coal resources and clean coal technology will alter the pattern of imports into California; and the emergence of Mexico as a major supplier to southern California and Arizona, contributing to a bifurcation of the Western Grid into northern and southern markets. 5. Unbundling failures that push companies back to portfolio strategies -- For California investor-owned utilities, unbundling has achieved neither the least-cost solution sought by regulators nor value maximization targeted by investors. This necessitates a reevaluation of portfolio management strategies potentially involving generation, transmission, power trading and marketing, and retail businesses in multiple geographies serving multiple markets. 6. Ineffectiveness in changing siting and development restrictions -- California's retail price caps and multiple explanations for the crisis have left accelerated siting processes and environmental standards changes open to challenge by various interests. In addition, limiting application of new siting orders only to small generators contributes to uncertainty and investor hesitancy. 7. Procurement management that alters user-utility negotiating leverage -- Competitive markets compel participants -- suppliers, marketers, large industrial buyers, etc. -- to strategically manage procurement as a critical value-driver. Because risk is explicitly shared and always has the potential of shifting advantage to either seller or buyer, the sophistication of negotiations and contracts increases as competitive markets evolve. 8. Increased emphasis on distributed generation and new technologies -- California's reliability and price challenges have triggered a re-emergence of energy crisis measures from the 1970s. End-users are investing in solutions they control, and the distributed generation market is being aggressively developed among large retailers, industrial users and residential customers. This makes possible the development of microgrids connecting consumers in local areas and related changes in traditional grid systems, from modifications in interconnection agreements to changing definitions of reserve margins and system reliability. Industry Executives' Response Senior executives from sixteen non-California utilities with a combined market capitalization over $120 billion and $145 billion in revenues responded to an Andersen survey with their views of the implications of the California power crisis for their companies and for the industry. The survey, conducted between February 19, 2001 and March 2, 2001 by Knowledge Systems &amp; Research, Inc. of Syracuse, found that the companies are observing the California situation carefully, expect a slowing -- but not a turnaround -- of deregulation, and believe their internal plans and preparations are on-target for the changing environment: -- Deregulation -- Nearly all executives believe recent California events will slow the pace of deregulation over the next five years for states that have not begun or finished writing restructuring legislation. None believe that it will cause advanced states to re-regulate markets, although many states will review their legislation to assess their risk of duplicating California's current situation and make any changes necessary to avoid it. -- National legislation -- Few executives suggest the situation will initiate national energy policy/legislation; others believe it will be a continuing issue but, because of state-to-state variances, Congress will be unable to pass any comprehensive measures or force states to a restructuring timeline. Some expect additional state-level legislation. -- Company strategies -- Most do not see any changes to their business models or strategies for generation, distribution or supply procurement as a response to the situation in California. However, many have expanded their risk management programs, reduced spot market purchases, begun emphasizing long-term supply contracts, planning new power generation capacity, and started hedging with futures trades. Those facing price caps are rethinking their stance on them. -- Investor scrutiny -- Many executives indicate their shareholders are aware of the situation and investors -- particularly institutional investors -- are more heavily scrutinizing their actions. Many say news coverage has prompted retail, commercial and industrial customer skepticism of industry restructuring. -- Transmission deregulation -- Many executives agree the California situation will increase interest in FERC's regional transmission organizations (RTO) deregulation effort. Utility Company Action Items Both to guard against a sudden California cascade and as a potentially powerful competitive thrust, forward-thinking utilities should bolster their basic preparedness with a variety of tactics -- or inoculations -- specifically aimed to combat a potential California power virus, according to Andersen partner Mark Moskovitz: -- Improve procurement management and risk management capabilities -- To manage exposure to volatile supply and demand shifts, organizations must be sure that comprehensive and clear supply procedures, controls, decision points, risk limits and communications are in place. -- Plan and design innovative rate and pricing structures -- Companies and regulators must focus on communicating price signals that create value for both the customer and the provider. Innovative rate and pricing structures that more closely tie the customer's price to the real cost of supply will better signal the value of the service as well as providing more accurate information upon which both end user and supplier can make decisions. -- Increase emphasis on demand side management (DSM) strategies -- In addition to new pricing strategies to help achieve and maintain supply-demand equilibrium, companies must now focus on employing more extensive and innovative demand side management programs. These programs may offer significant benefits with limited risk to both the customer and energy supplier. -- Assess the supply and generation dynamics in adjacent jurisdictions -- Companies must take a broader view -- beyond typical geographic market definitions -- of the economics of generation and related business decisions in an increasingly volatile market in which supply will follow the best prices. -- Develop contingency plans for the continued deferral of new generation capacity -- In the face of potential ongoing generation capacity shortages, companies and regulators must be prepared to move with a portfolio of strategies to meet demand, including for example DSM, flexible pricing and distributed generation. In addition, they should explore efficiency-improving upgrades to existing facilities and seize any opportunity to accelerate near-term construction plans. -- Proactively address potential organizational disruption -- As regulatory and economic changes continue to churn the industry waters and companies adjust and/or restructure, they must be highly cogniscent of, sensitive to, and directly address employees' concerns with information about the company's future and theirs'. Industry/Regulatory Lessons There are also a number of broad primary lessons the electric power industry -- nationally and internationally -- should take away from its first major domestic test case in deregulation and restructuring, according to Andersen principal David O. Jermain: -- Simplify market design. -- Build a continuing role for regulators. -- Maintain communications with multiple constituent interests. -- Prepare contingency plans for extreme stress conditions. -- Couple real-time retail pricing with transparently priced wholesale competition. -- Provide special incentives for RTO investment, formation and development. -- Break down regulatory and political barriers to market signals and responses.

The first warm spell of the season is expected to cause temperatures to jump 10 degrees, leading to a 2,000 megawatt increase in electricity consumption -- the equivalent of two large power plants. The week started out with a peak demand of 28,835 megawatts, but by tomorrow it is forecasted to top 30,500 megawatts. This comes as hydroelectricity resources (both Northwest and California) run low, more than 10,000 megawatts of power plants remain off line due to planned and unplanned maintenance, and some 3,000 megawatts of Qualifying Facilities or alternative energy suppliers are not operating. The California ISO's renewed call for conservation precedes a forecast of 90 degree highs in the inland areas that may tempt many Californians to flip on air conditioners. For conservation tips -- such as using fans instead of air conditioners, setting thermostat at 78 degrees, etc. -- please see the California ISO's web site www.caiso.com. New Notification System: With a challenging summer around the corner, the California ISO wants to do all it can to bring information to the public as quickly as possible. For that reason, a new notification system is being brought on line. Media and the public can now access the Internet to keep current if rotating blackouts are issued. Navigation: Visit www.caiso.com Click on System Conditions for current information on rotating outages (will appear only when activated) For previous outage information (last hour, etc.), click on Market Notices, scroll to bottom of page and click on Notice Log The California ISO is also testing a new service to notify newsrooms immediately by email should the ISO initiate electrical emergencies (Stage One - Three) or rotating outages. If you would like to participate, please email kwerst@caiso.com with a maximum of one email address per newsroom. Additionally, a single on-call media pager number has been established: 916/815-0679. To make it easier on media, ISO Communications will no longer be posting on-call schedules for media spokespersons on the web site. Simply call the on-call pager after hours. News releases alerting the media to electrical emergencies will continue, as will news conferences held on-site in Folsom and via telephone. As a reminder, if you wish to visit the ISO control rooms (in Folsom or Alhambra) always call ISO Communications first at 888/516-NEWS to make an appointment. Access to the control rooms may be limited on certain days, depending on system conditions and/or level of requests from media.

Ms. Crenshaw,

 Thank you very much for the message. I am very interested in the
opportunity to talk to personnel from the Research Group at Enron. Between
the two days you suggest, I prefer Wednesday 12/6. Considering the
two-hour time difference between California and Texas, 11:00 am Pacific
time (1:00 pm your time) seems to be a good slot. However, I am open most
of the day on 12/6 so if some other time slot is prefered on your end,
please let me know.

 Thanks again. I look forward to talking to you and your
colleagues.

Ken,

My name is Chad Tipton.  I am currently a Development Support Manager with 
EES in the Integrated Asset Management (IAM).   Recently, I  had the good 
fortune to meet, Ron Hosmer.  He represents a company called IdleAire 
Technologies, Inc..  IdleAire is a startup company started in 1999.   
IdleAire has developed a system to eliminate truckdrivers from having to idle 
their trucks while on long haul overnight stops.  Their plan is to electrify 
truckstops and install remote HVAC units to eliminate truck idling.  Also, 
these units provide cable TV and internet services.  They have already 
piloted the technology in several truckstops in the Knoxville, TN area.

IdleAire's  goal is to: 

""........evolve the nation's truck stops and travel centers into the largest 
truck stop electrification network in the world. We are taking truck stop 
electrification to the next level. Our travel center conversions provide 
heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) at every parking space. We 
also provide drivers in-cab telephone, Internet and television.""

Idle Air has caught the attention of many interest groups in Washington, 
D.C.  Ron tells me that they have already gained support from Tennessee 
congressmen, including Jimmy Duncan and  Van Hilleary.   Also, former House 
Speaker, Newt Gingrich is on the board of directors of IdleAire 
Technologies.  These individuals support this technology because it reduces 
emissions and helps state quality for CMAQ funds.  

I had mentioned to Ron, that I worked for Enron and informed him about what 
we do.  He and I both felt that Enron may be interested in developing a 
strategic partnership to take their technology to market.   Ron said that 
they are looking for a strategic partner with energy related experience and 
the capital to invest in this project.  

Enron would benefit in several ways:

1.  Greater than average returns.

2.  Increased publicity and recognition in Enron's environmental role.  (EPA 
Energy Star Label, EPA Climate Protection Award, etc....)
 
3.  Increase markets for electricity and possibly gas.

4.  Maintain Enron's title of innovation leader.

5.  Open a whole new market for the energy services group. (EES)  Long term 
maintenance contract, commodities, etc....

6.  Open a new market for the broadband services group. (EBS)  Videos on 
demand.

I believe this opportunity is very synergistic with Enron's business model.  
If you would be interested in talking with Ron, I would be happy to introduce 
him to you.  They have a  very comprehensive business plan that lays out 
their business in detail.   I have arranged for him to provide us with an 
executive summary of the business.  You can also find out more about the 
company by visiting their website at:

www.idleaire.com

Thank you  for your time.

Maureen asked me to set up an interview with you for a summer intern that has
been displaced a couple of times, first with EES and then with EBS.  She evidently
wants him to assist her.  He has some economics in his background.  His name is
Salah M. Mattoo..

Do you want to do this?   I am afraid we don't have any space for him and if we put
him somewhere else, he will not be much help to Maureen.

Let me know.

Per our conversation on coordination of our efforts on California and other 
jurisdictions, we have developed the following training program:

1.    Anti-trust -- we have completed anti-trust training in Houston for 
traders and have scheduled it in Portland and Calgary.

2.    Sales Practices -- this training has been completed in Portland and is 
being scheduled in Houston and Calgary.

3.    Anti-manipulation -- this training has been completed in Portland, but 
needs to be expanded to cover local law manipulation issues.  It also needs 
to be scheduled in Houston and Calgary. 

Also, the above training needs to be supplemented with training on local 
power pool rules.  There is a similar program being prepared in London.  A 
meeting is being scheduled so we can discuss these matters further.

Elizabeth, Jeff forwarded me your questions about capacity options.  I've 
answered them to the extent they involve legal/regulatory issues.  If you 
need anything further please don't hesitate to call.

?  Can a new shipper who enters into an FTS-1 contract with zero MDQ in order 
to purchase a shipper call option or sell a transporter put option be 
allowed, prior to the exercise date, to transfer the underlying option rights 
by permanently releasing this contract?    YES.

?   Will we be required to report these contracts with zero MDQ on the Index 
of Customers and/or the Transactional Report?  YES.

? Can the releasing shipper permanently release a portion of his existing MDQ 
and choose to keep or transfer the option rights?   YES.  The shipper could 
even release all of its MDQ (reducing it to zero) and keep its option rights.

? How is it determined whether a contract with an option amendment is within 
the min/max tariff rate or needs to be filed as a negotiated rate?  The 
option fee is converted to a per-Dth, per day rate and added to the transport 
rate.  If the total exceeds the maximum tariff rate, it's ""negotiated"".  
Otherwise, our position is that it's not negotiated.  We are not 100% 
positive that FERC will agree with us on this issue.","PRIVILEGED & CONFIDENTIAL Attorney/Client Communication: Your TW Capacity Options questions.

Ray Alvarez brought to my attention today a news item indicating that the Congressional Budget Office released a report earlier this week entitled ""Causes and Lessons of the California Electricity Crisis.""  The 30+ page report is available on the home page of the CBO's web site at www.cbo.gov.  I have quickly read through the summary and it is largely favorable.  For example, the summary says:

""Much of the blame for California's electricity crisis attaches to the state's restructuring plan -- but not to its objective, electricity deregulation. (...)  But deregulation itself did not fail; rather, it was never achieved.""

""The restructuring plan did not remove sufficient barriers on both the supply and demand sides of the market to allow competition to work -- in part because it was not designed to.""

""Even without restructuring, California's electric utilities would have faced a difficult challenge in meeting the demand for power and holding down prices in 2000.""

""Consequently, wholesale electricity prices were higher than they probably would have been in either a traditionally regulated market or a more fully deregulated market.""

""Long-term solutions to California's electricity problems will most likely require three changes: removing barriers to the addition of generating capacity, eliminating bottlenecks in the electricity transmission system, and removing regulatory restrictions on the sale of power throughout the broad western market.""

On the negative side, the report summary does state that ""some generators may also have withheld supplies at certain times to boost prices even more"" and ""the plan's auction system for the spot market appears to have created strong incentives for suppliers to bid strategically in a way that raised wholesale prices.""

Attached is the proposed press release, which includes input from Rebecca, 
Cole and Neil.  We are tentatively planning to issue the release Monday , 
October 11, but in case word leaks to the media from Cole's meetings with 
local landowners starting tomorrow, we may need to issue this week.  With 
that in mind, would you please provide me any comments on the attached 
document by the end of the day tomorrow, October 6.

Please note that this project has received tremendous local resistance to 
date, so we are quoting Cole and adding much more information about the local 
benefits to try to address these issues.  We are drafting a Q&A document and 
key message points for use with local and national media and the investor 
audience.

Vince,

  I've been hearing rumors that Enron has decided to endorse
the nodal pricing model as implemented in PJM.
I just wanted to warn you that I'm not sure
this is in Enron's long-term interest at all.  Let me explain
why.  Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talk
more about this.

  First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing
and specifically pricing congestion.  However, the way that PJM
implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility
and reduce the transparency of the market.  Specifically, the
PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a
%10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems
is out of merit in one of the three zones in region.  (The fact
that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.)
Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting
software to compute new nodal prices.  The way I have (somewhat
unfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the
PJM ISO decides what prices it would like
for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them.  This is not
a transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buy
the risk management services that Enron provides.  The
only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is
that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area
to meet demand.  Under these circumstances, you need to pay the
imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market.

  However, bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on the
East Coast.  This will effectively mean little imports
to the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated at
the discretion of the ISO.  Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-service
mitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility.
It effectively kills off the development of risk management at
the wholesale and retail level.  Power marketing becomes much less
profitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigated
prices.

  In short, the PJM model is not market.  It is just an alternative
form of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces
price volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just
get a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-service
regulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-service
mitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-service
prices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators.

  As we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sources
of benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-side
involved in the market and from more efficient risk management.  A
necessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect
actual conditions in the market (including the extent of market power
exercised).  Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market
participants to make the investment necessary to management.  The PJM
model is just way to have a market in name without achieving any
significant benefits to consumers or energy traders.

		 Subject: Update Day 1 Second Session FERC CA Settlement

In the Room

Conference attended by all in-state generators, a few munies, the IOUs and a 
few others. One attorney from CPUC, but on phone. Barbara Barkovich attended 
for CA Large Consumers.  Nader sent someone.  No other consumers.  One other 
ESP -- Strategic Energy (only operates in San Diego).
Judge reports that only 6 offers have been submitted to FERC for sales to the 
IOUs (note; Enron submitted one of the offers). The offers total 2000 MW. The 
prices are quite divergent.  He expresses concern at the little offered.
Generators suggest that more could be offered if FERC could be more flexible 
on terms (FERC required 24/7 offers).
IOUs and others press judge to seek offers from others not present (e.g., 
BPA, other marketers, SW utilities), but judge does not offer to do so.
Barkovich says can't throw large customers into non-core market now.
Everyone agrees that we are all looking for a blended wholesale rate (part 
existing gen, part OFs, part forward contract and part spot) that meshes with 
the IOUs' ability to recover the costs in rates -- so tied to CPUC rate 
increase.
Discussion of CPUC PD -- not enough
Enron able to take low profile.
SDG&E suggested terminating the settlement talks at FERC, saying nothing 
could be achieved.
Not much happens until 4:30 pm, when judge blows up -- judge directed 
epithets at SDG&E and SCE.  SCE had refused to cooperate from the beginning.  

Out of the Room

Separate talks between PG&E and SDG&E and some of the generators.
Late in the day, Judge meets with IOUs.
Parties agree informally that forum does not work well given lack of CPUC 
involvement, but some believe that FERC is only hope for a workable 
resolution.

Next Steps -- The Judge Speaks

Judge asked everyone to consider how to ""Share the Pain"" for Thursday's 
meeting and said not to expect any ""win:win"" scenario. His view is that FERC 
is better than the CA legislature or bankruptcy court.
His focus will be on Wolak proposal to share the pain, as submitted in 
12/1/00 comments to FERC -- forces all sellers to CA to sell most of its 
supply (either generation or marketer offers) as cost-based rates in forward 
contracts, or lose ability to sell at market-based rates.  Generators oppose 
this, I believe.
Enron planning to continue low profile but to discuss options with ENA.",Update Day 1 Second Session FERC CA Settlement,1,"Company Business, Strategy, etc."

Subject: Re: ken lay tour  

All--here's some thoughts on the RGA related events.  We currently have Ken 
scheduled to participate in an energy roundtable discussion on the afternoon 
of the 2nd with at least four governors attending that session--Kempthorne, 
Hull, Geringer and Ridge.  (Engler and Rowland are also attending the overall 
event, but they will be in a healthcare breakout session).  Kaufman and I 
thought that it would be particularly helpful for Arizona Gov Hull and Idaho 
Gov Kempthorne to hear Ken's remarks and have a chance to talk with him.  

I have also been working with Rosalee to schedule an early evening 
(6:00-7:00pm) meeting that night  with Exelon co CEO John Rowe. John Rowe 
will be in California for some investor meetings and well as attending some 
sections of the RGA events.  I have told my counterpart at Rowe's office that 
we would confirm Ken's availability on Monday morning.

If you do decide that Ken should attend the Davis meeting in Sacremento that 
day instead, we will just reconfigure a bit.  Paul and I will cover the RGA 
events and I will cancel the John Rowe get together. I would also want to 
talk about having Mr. Lay reach out to Hull and Kempthorne via phone sometime 
in the near future.  Same with Rowe.

I received a return call from Lelanie in Governor Davis' office this 
evening.  She said the Governor wanted to invite Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling to 
a meeting the Governor is having at 2:00 p.m. in Sacramento on May 2 with a 
lot of CEOs.  I still pressed for a one on one meeting on May 3 in 
Sacramento, but she told me the Governor wanted to have the one meeting all 
at once and his schedule was very tight on Thursday, May 3.   I transferred 
her to Sherri and called Ken.  Ken wanted me to try to get more specific 
information, which she shared that it is with generators - Sempra, Williams, 
CalPine, Duke, Dynegy, and Reliant.  She also said since the Governor has 
worked with Ken, she thought he might prefer that he attend.  Ken said to let 
you all know and be thinking whether we even want to do it.  He said one 
thought might be that he'd do that meeting and maybe Jeff could do the one in 
L.A. on May 2.

Talk to you Monday.

Just so we're all on the same page......Dasovich will arrive in Houston on 
Monday (mid-day) and will travel with Dr. Lay beginning on Wednesday (to 
Austin) and then on to LAX, Sacramento etc.  Steve said there really isn't 
time to have a pre-briefing so any questions that Ken has will have to be 
addressed enroute to CA.  

Rosalee....we're giving Steve the briefing book today so he can review over 
the weekend and we'll have a final copy to Ken before he departs next week.

		 Subject: Greening the Enron Building Mtg

Wanted to give you brief feedback on our efforts to become the 1st Fortune 
500 Company that has a 100% green headquarters.  We've established a 
company-wide team and a working plan going forward, which includes:

1.  EES commodity team is going to run the numbers for energy commodity for 
facilities and give them a proposal by end of next week.  While facilities 
will not be part of the TX pilot, EES can arrange a financial deal for them 
w/ an option of going physical on 1/1/02.   EES commodity team will also let 
the group know of the offer, in order to structure the REC deal.  Depending 
upon the savings that EES can offer to Facilities, we will determine any 
""headroom"" for REC purchases.
Note: It is not necessary for Facilities to sign a commodity deal w/ EES in 
order for the ""greening"" of the building to go forward.  The RECs can be 
purchased and retired irrespective of the commodity deal with EES.  HOWEVER, 
it would be optimum for Facilities to sign on w/ EES and use the cost savings 
toward purchase of the RECs.  Facilities stated intent to do the latter.
2. Michael Payne and Mike Curry are going to be working on determining a cost 
for the RECs.  Michael initially projected $250,000 per year for the 
requisite number of RECs to retire commensurate w/ the demand of the 
building.  This was at a cost of $8 per REC, which I believe is quite high.  
I think they'll go for a $1-4 dollar range, bringing the cost down to a max 
of $125,000.  There's several ways to slice this end.  We can provide some of 
the RECs from the EWC facility and buy other RECs from the market in order to 
minimize the cost impact of the REC purchases.
3.  Next Thursday we will be able to get more of an exact figure on the 
premium cost for the RECs (ie how much over the cost savings will the RECs 
cost).  We will then need to decide the following:
 a. Would Corp/EHS being will to pitch in to cover any additional cost for 
the RECs;
 b. Pitching the idea to Skilling for buyoff, and payment for the RECs;
 c. Possibly getting buyoff from the business units since this could change 
what they are currently paying for power.
4. We discussed all of the above with Peggy Mahoney, and she asked us to take 
a stab at a comprehensive press release announcing all of the bells and 
whistles on the new building and our being the 1st Fortune 500 company to go 
100% green in our headquarters.   Catherine McKalip Thompson is working on 
the first draft.  We need to determine if we can get the ""best"" press for 
this commitment (i.e. stories in the WSJ and NY Times).  We determined that 
the message would need to be targeted, specifying the terms of our 
commitment....i.e. Enron makes a commitment for 3 years to provide 100% green 
for its headquarters in Houston, making it the first Fortune 500 company 
to.......

The goal is to have a final plan and decision by April 20th when Steve speaks 
to high level executives at a prelude to Earth Day NY on the topic of Energy 
Shock--Crisis or Opportunity: Building Economics and the Environment.

Mike, we'll definitely need your continued support and assistance, 
particularly if this goes to Skilling.  I'll keep you posted on the progress.

You are invited to a meeting next Thursday (3/22) afternoon at 2:00 to 
discuss energy commodity and renewable energy credits for the Enron Building, 
Center and Stadium.  There are a few efforts that are going on simultaneously 
and I thought it would be a good idea for all of us to meet and get on the 
same page.  As many of you might know, Enron Wind (Michael Payne) and ENA 
(Mike Curry) have a great proposal to retire renewable energy credits from 
our Enron Wind facility to match the consumption of the building and stadium 
(details attached below).  If this proposal goes forward, Enron would be the 
1st Fortune 500 company to ""go green"" in its headquarters building.  Couple 
this w/ our energy star award, and we have GREAT environmental messaging.   
We'd like to highlight this announcement on Earth Day (April 22nd).

The facilities folks are interested in switching from Reliant to EES for 
actual commodity.  It makes sense to work strategically together on win-win 
proposal that will not only make sense economically, but that we can use in 
our messaging.  The focus of the meeting is to discuss the various proposals, 
and steps for moving forward.   

The meeting will be in EB50MO3 from 2:00-3:00. Please let me know if you or 
someone from your group can attend.

I agree with Mona: we need to include some customer contacts . . . it gives 
them an opportunity to look smart about going to the marketplace and getting 
price protection.

The messages need to include Palmer's top three:  1) price  caps cause 
shortages (Rob- can you put together soe historical examples?); 2) better 
solutions are already available; and 3) short term politics makes for long 
term problems.

On item 2) we need to talk about the competitive offerings to San Diego, the 
fixed price offerings available at retail, and the availability of 
conservation and demand side management technology today (including its 
availability to the consuming public from existing suppliers . . .  ie you 
don't need to wait for Enron to make a consumer offering).

Subject: Re: Price Cap Media--DRAFT  

I have a couple of suggestions on parts of the draft.

Media Action:
In addition to doing behind the scenes editorial board meetings and the like, 
I would suggest that we get our coalition lined up and ready to release 
statements for certain key events which are likely to occur over the next 
several weeks, such as:

1.  SDG&E's selection of the winning bid to their RFP.  Even if Enron isn't 
selected as the winning bid, the coalition should trumpet the market-based 
solution and the enormous market response to SDG&E's RFP.
2.  The Commission vote on UCAN's Emergency Motion.  We should be prepared to 
issue a statement whether the Cmmn votes with us or against us.  With us, the 
market can and did provide reasonable, expedient solutions to SDG&E's 
customers and protection from price spikes.  Against us, despite the 
overwhelming market response, the Cmmn chose to ignore the market solutions 
and impose more regulation.
3.  Potential for ARM members to surface a Provider of Last Resort proposal 
within the next couple of weeks.
4.  ISO Bd. Mtg-keep up pressure against reducing price caps.

Coalition Members:

Agree that those groups listed should be contacted, although the CMA, CRA, 
CIU, CLECA have been luke-warm in their advocacy.

I would add our customers (UC/CSU (especially the San Diego branch), PacTel, 
etc.)  NewEnergy has indicated that Kroger/Ralph's grocery stores, San 
Diego-based, would give testimonials.  I could solicit the members of ARM to 
identify a key customer contacts for interviews.  

We could check with our lobbyists and see who they would recommend (wine 
growers, dairy industry, etc.)  We should also consider the water agencies 
and the rural counties and the City of Pittsburg.  While the immediate 
message is responding to San Diego's situation, this latter group of 
potential coalition members would go to the larger message (keeping benefits 
of competitive markets) from a state-wide perspective.  What about the City

","Re: Price Cap Media--DRAFT. I agree with Mona: we need to include some customer contacts . . . it gives them an opportunity to look smart about going to the marketplace and getting price protection. The messages need to include Palmer's top three: 1) price caps cause shortages (Rob- can you put together soe historical examples?); 2) better solutions are already available; and 3) short term politics makes for long term problems. On item 2) we need to talk about the competitive offerings to San Diego, the fixed price offerings available at retail, and the availability of conservation and demand side management technology today (including its availability to the consuming public from existing suppliers . . . ie you don't need to wait for Enron to make a consumer offering).

Media Action: In addition to doing behind the scenes editorial board meetings and the like, I would suggest that we get our coalition lined up and ready to release statements for certain key events which are likely to occur over the next several weeks, such as: 1. SDG&E's selection of the winning bid to their RFP. Even if Enron isn't selected as the winning bid, the coalition should trumpet the market-based solution and the enormous market response to SDG&E's RFP. 2. The Commission vote on UCAN's Emergency Motion. We should be prepared to issue a statement whether the Cmmn votes with us or against us. With us, the market can and did provide reasonable, expedient solutions to SDG&E's customers and protection from price spikes. Against us, despite the overwhelming market response, the Cmmn chose to ignore the market solutions and impose more regulation. 3. Potential for ARM members to surface a Provider of Last Resort proposal within the next couple of weeks. 4. ISO Bd. Mtg-keep up pressure against reducing price caps. Coalition Members: Agree that those groups listed should be contacted, although the CMA, CRA, CIU, CLECA have been luke-warm in their advocacy. I would add our customers (UC/CSU (especially the San Diego branch), PacTel, etc.) NewEnergy has indicated that Kroger/Ralph's grocery stores, San Diego-based, would give testimonials. I could solicit the members of ARM to identify a key customer contacts for interviews. We could check with our lobbyists and see who they would recommend (wine growers, dairy industry, etc.) We should also consider the water agencies and the rural counties and the City of Pittsburg. While the immediate message is responding to San Diego's situation, this latter group of potential coalition members would go to the larger message (keeping benefits of competitive markets) from a state-wide perspective. What about the City of Pittsburg?

USA: UPDATE 1-Calif. seizes stranded SoCal Edison energy contracts.
  
02/02/2001 
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 


SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - California Gov. Gray Davis on Friday blocked 
the California Power Exchange from liquidating stranded energy contracts held 
by cash-strapped utility Southern California Edison, seizing the assets for 
the state.


The governor's office said the order, issued late on Thursday and put in 
effect on Friday, was needed to ""preserve"" the contracts' value for 
power-starved California consumers.


""I am using my emergency powers to seize options to buy very inexpensive 
power that would otherwise be lost forever,"" Davis said in a statement.


""These options will provide reliable power through the end of the year. It is 
important to protect these contracts for the people of California,"" he said.


A Los Angeles judge on January 24 issued a temporary injunction, valid for a 
week, blocking the exchange's sale of the contracts.


The California Power Exchange (CalPX) said Davis' order nullified a Los 
Angeles County Superior Court decision earlier Friday that authorized CalPX 
to liquidate Edison's forward market positions.


The exchange said they had sought to liquidate the contracts to recover about 
$255 million that Edison has failed to pay to CalPX market participants.


While agreeing to transfer the contracts to the state, the exchange pointed 
out that the law requires that California pay a ""reasonable value"" for them, 
which it estimated at nearly $652 million on today's market.


Delivery of the first contracts, which total 2.8 million megawatt hours, is 
scheduled to begin Monday, February 5.


One megawatt hour is roughly the amount of electricity needed to light 1,000 
homes for 60 minutes.


Davis is desperately seeking cheap power for the state after the utilities' 
financial meltdown pushed them to the market's sidelines. Spot market 
purchases for the state are currently being made by the Department of Water 
Resources, but at typically higher prices than in the ""forwards"" market.


Block forward energy contracts secure electricity deliveries over a given 
""block"" of time at a price agreed months in advance, shielding the buyer from 
the kind of price volatility that has recently roiled the short-term ""spot"" 
market.


The overall value of SoCal Edison's contracts, agreed last year for power to 
be delivered in 2001, was not immediately known, but CalPX officials said 
last month they hoped their liquidation would cover the $215 million 
SoCalEdison owned the exchange.


SoCal Edison, the utility subsidiary of Rosemead, Calif.-based Edison 
International, has warned it is no longer able to meet its financial 
obligations after running up a debt of nearly $5 billion buying wholesale 
power in the spot market, where prices have soared ten-fold over the past few 
months amid a regional energy shortage.


The utility is blocked by the state's 1996 deregulation law from passing 
these high wholesale prices down to consumers, who are still protected by a 
rate freeze.


That same deregulation legislation created the CalPX, making it the 
state-sanctioned exchange for electricity trading. SoCal Edison was among the 
biggest buyers on the exchange.


CalPX, crushed by a mountain of debt it is unable to recover from Edison, has 
shut its spot market operations and is winding down its business affairs.

Although I don't yet have all the facts, Steve Hall said that late yesterday 
(Friday) afternoon, the Governor exercised eminent domain over the IOU 
forward contracts that the PX had been in the process of auctioning to pay PX 
participants.  I would like Bracewell to research at least the following two 
possible ways this action is unlawful.  First, this violates the banking 
provisions of the PX tariff (Section 6).  These provisions requires the PX to 
hold all PX accounts in trust for PX participants.  Second, these are 
wholesale contracts and the State only has the right to exercise eminent 
domain concerning retail service.  I don't have any law to support the second 
idea but think it should be researched nonetheless.  ","Challenge to exercise of Eminent Domain - Confidential Attorney Work Product.

Vince: 
I wanted to get back to you with a reply to your question about my  
recommendation on a patent attorney.  I cannot give you a personal  
recommendation per se because, in the end, I opted not to hire an attorney to  
file my patent until I had decided whether I wanted to protect my work as a  
trade secret or as a patented commodity.  I ultimately struck a compromise  
position by filing my own ""provisional patent application.""  This establishes  
the date of my claim and gives me one year in which to finalize the patent?  
or not; it also provides patent pending protection from the date I filed it  
with the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office. 
In the process of investigating the options for safeguarding my intellectual  
property, however, I did talk to quite a number of patent attorneys.  Of  
these, I think that perhaps David Richie might be the most appropriate for  
your son's software idea.  He talked as though he had a particular specialty  
in software issues; he also struck me as competent and aggressive.  He  
practices in the Silicon Valley and can be reached at telephone number (408)  
282-1856. 
I suspect that he has already done so, but if not, your son might want to  
visit the internet site of the U. S. Patent Office.  Basic information and  
forms can be downloaded from there.  Two other, newer sites might also  
intrigue him-both deal with the protection, valuation and marketing of  
intellectual property, patents, etc.  They are:

Subject:	FW: Request for PR2 Access

Steve -- For your approval.  As some additional information regarding the request, Kathy, Diane Taylor and I met with Deana Taylor this afternoon to understand what each person's role was and the specific access needed.  For the interim, we are recommending that the HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP and View Payroll and Time ENTP role be granted to each of the individuals listed below.  Until January 1, this function was performed in the Payroll Department and at that time was transitioned to Karen and Deana's group.  The people listed below actually transferred from the Payroll Department.  For the long term, we are going to look at creating a specific role for this group that would let them access only those data elements needed.

I've spoken with Mary Joyce by phone and she has approved, so I am requesting your approval as well.  These people have basically been prevented from being able to reconcile any of the net pay accounts, etc.  for the past week.

Please let me know if you will approve or if you need any additional information.
Thanks.

Subject:	Request for PR2 Access

Jo Ann,
As we discussed I am sending this email to request PR2 Enterprise access re-activated for the following employees:
  
   Karen Choyce               HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP
   Deana Taylor                HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP
   Joanne Cortez              HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP     (starting in the group 7/16)
   Rebecca Tran               HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP   &   View Payroll and Time
   Roy Comeaux              HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP   &   View Payroll and Time
   George Howell              HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP   &   View Payroll and Time  

Please note I am not requesting access for the entire department,  the list of employees above are the only individuals in our group that will be allowed this type of access. Corp's payroll accounting group is responsible for reconciling the general ledger balance sheet accounts across all Enron companies, therefore Enterprise access is needed.

The requested access is essential for our group to perform our job.   Without this, we are unable to trace amounts related to FIT, FICA, net pay, stock option deductions, etc,  through the payroll system to the ledger, and to ensure that the items are accounted for properly.   Equally as important,  the access enables us to identify system issues between PR2 (payroll) and PR1 (ledger).   Corp's payroll accounting group has already identified several processing issues and alerted the ISC.   

I hope this ""pleads our case"" on why we need the access and request it be re-activated.    Please feel free to call me or Mark Lindsey, if you need additional information. 

Thanks,
Deana

Corp's payroll accounting group is responsible for reconciling the general ledger balance sheet accounts across all Enron companies, therefore Enterprise access is needed. The requested access is essential for our group to perform our job. Without this, we are unable to trace amounts related to FIT, FICA, net pay, stock option deductions, etc, through the payroll system to the ledger, and to ensure that the items are accounted for properly. Equally as important, the access enables us to identify system issues between PR2 (payroll) and PR1 (ledger). Corp's payroll accounting group has already identified several processing issues and alerted the ISC. I hope this ""pleads our case"" on why we need the access and request it be re-activated.

The rate case that the governmental affairs group filed in January, on behalf 
of Transredes, has come to a very successful conclusion and the new rates 
will go into effect towards the end of this month.  The rates are not much 
lower than what we filed for, and represent a very significant increase over 
the previous rates.  The tariff methodology and revised regulations, put into 
effect by the Supreme Decree, were followed to the letter by the regulator 
despite political pressure to arbitrarily keep rates down.  The deliverables 
here were to (1) obtain a tariff methodology via Supreme Decree that would 
make the company finance-able / rescue it from dire financial straits and (2) 
file a rate case and prosecute it to obtain hard rates in accordance with the 
tariff methodology.  This second deliverable has now been completed.  
Transredes has had a bond issue pending since last year due to the 
uncertainty about rates; it is my understanding that the financial market 
loved the ruling and that Transredes sold $40 million worth of bonds in about 
5 minutes!  This ruling should also significantly increase Transredes's 
market value, relative to Enron's efforts to sell its interest in the company.

Subject: Tariffs Approved

Gentlemen,

I am delighted to report that SIRESE approved substantial increases in TR's 
tariffs consistent with the Law and Regulation.  The details are :-

     Existing Tariff SIRESE Approved % Increase TR/CLHB Proposed TR/CLHB % 
Increase

Gas Export (including surcharges)  $0.18  $0.2205  22.5%  $0.26 (excluding 
RG)  44.4%
Liquids Domestic    $1.05  $2.46  134.3%  $3.25    209.5%
Liquids Export     $1.55  $2.31  49%  $3.35    116.1%

CLHB's tariffs were also approved as follows $1.19  $2.20  84.9%  $3.528    
196.5%

As you can see we did substantially better than CLHB (comparable with our 
liquids domestic) !!

We will get a detailed report on the assumptions used by SIRESE to reach 
their conclusions on Monday, but our inteligence suggests the following :-

1. Export gas volumes increased to 100% TR capacity, and 100% GSA + Cuiaba 2 
assumed for SDA and TEMIN purposes
2. RG Compresion project deleted
3. Interest rate reduced to 10 or 10.5 % i.e. the rate in our bond issue
4. Liquids expansion in the South reduced
5. Some continuity of service CAPEX reduced
6. Unknown OPEX reduction and maybe a change to the OPEX allocation between 
concesions
7. OCC in service date slipped from 2003 to 2004.
8. Debt/Equity assumption changed from 60/40 to 70/30

Our strategy to respond to each of these points is as follows :-

1. Volumes.  Covered by 8% rule, we can blete but can expect little back 
here.  Clearly we will appeal if volumes exceed installed capacity in the 
short term i.e. 2002/2003.
2. RG Compression - not worth fighting for since we don't even have the 
support of BG
3. Interest Rate - We'll get this back when we do a tariff  revision and 
actual rates are used.  When we get the detail we will appeal if Jan feels we 
have concrete grounds i.e. commision costs etc. are omited.
4. Liquids Expansion in the South.  Here we intend to do a detailed analysis 
of exactly what has been deleted and as a result what liquids/gas production 
will be shut in.  If possible all assumptions to be agreed with the affected 
producers (PB, BG, Vintage and Chaco).  We will then write to those 
producers(copy SIRESE , VMEH etc.) stating that on their recommendation the 
project scope was reduced by SIRESE.  We will give them an estimate of the 
lost liquids/gas production (in both volume and cash terms) resultant from 
this decision.  We will tell them that since they proposed these reductions 
we have no intention of appealing them but invite them to appeal.
5. Continuity of Service Capex.  We need to see the detail here.  We will 
take the moral high ground and be absolutely clear that we are not prepared 
to compromise our safety and environmental standards.  We need to see exactly 
what has been removed, but my thought is that if that means we are unable to 
provide some services (e.g. LPG transportation) or the continued operation of 
some liquids laterals, we should write to those producers affected suggesting 
that if they wish these services to be continued they need to appeal the 
decision.  Again since this is Capex we will get it back in the end on tariff 
revisions as long as the expenditure is approved on an annual basis in the 
SIRESE budget process.
6. OPEX - need to see the detail on Monday.
7. OCC - will not appeal - we need to do a detailed study to develop an OCC 
strategy.
8. Debt/Equity ratio.  Strictly speaking what has been done is in accordance 
with the Law/Regulation - the regulation says the maximum allowed equity is 
40%.  However, we have very strong grounds to appeal since : a) we are 
currently miles away from 60/40 let alone 70/30, b) we can only borrow for 
CAPEX (as per bond issue and the policy of all/most banks/lending 
institutions) with the case presented in the rate case if we borrow to cover 
100% of CAPEX we can easily demonstrate that we are still miles away from 
60/40.  We intend to fight this one very hard using all the 
external/independant help we can get.

As you are all aware our big exposure with the rate case was that the much 
needed substantial increase in liquids tariffs would not be approved and we 
would be subjected to some form of arbitary cut.  This has not happened 
SIRESE has now approved and hence owns these substantial increases.  Having 
got the big hike our job is now to claw back as much as we can from the above 
strategy in the full knowledge that the results of these efforts will be much 
smaller and hence managable increases.

Attached is an analysis of the individual impacts on the tariff of the above 
points and the corporate model using the new tariff with our volume 
assumptions (i.e. the worst case).

Regards,
Doug

Nice job!  Can you imagine the ""fun"" someone is going to have if a Region,
say SPP, MAIN, MAPP, WSCC, or FRCC, has a major blackout this summer and the
""loyal opposition"" ""discovers"" that said region has refused to sign an
agreement such as this and not implemented the program required by the
agreement.  That may even constitute ""willful neglect.""  Wouldn't it be even
worst if the ""discovery"" showed that the region was not signed because the
region wanted to use it's position as a bargaining ploy? (SPP, FRCC, and
WSCC) Oh no, I sound like a wantabe lawyer!

Subject: Compliance Agreement


Regional Managers
Compliance Task Force

As we discussed on the conference call on Friday, I have prepared a simple
draft letter of intent for the use of those regions who wish to indicate
support for the regional compliance and enforcement program, but are not
yet in a position to sign the Agreement for Regional Compliance and
Enforcement Programs that the NERC Board of Trustees approved on February
13.

For the benefit of those who were not on the call, I'd like to recap where
things stand at this point.  My apologies if I mischaracterize anyone's
position.  NPCC and ERCOT have signed the agreement.  ECAR has stated it
will sign the agreement at the signing ceremony on March 30.  SPP is
prepared to sign the agreement, but doesn't want to be the only one it its
part of the Eastern Interconnection to do so.  FRCC was not on the call,
but has previously stated that it is prepared to sign so long as at least
six regions sign.  MAPP and MAIN have indicated that they prefer to develop
their program with their own members before they sign the NERC
agreement.  WSCC may need to consider the matter at its Board meeting in
early April.  SERC has the matter under consideration.  I have not heard
from MAAC, but it has a meeting scheduling for March 29.

I want to share with you my concern for the climate in Washington.  In the
past few weeks I have had occasion to speak with a number of people on
Capitol Hill and in the new Administration.  All are very concerned about
what might happen this summer.  If a serious incident occurs, I am quite
sure that Congress will legislate very quickly--whether it will legislate
wisely is a different question.  We have the opportunity with this
agreement for the industry to take charge of its own destiny.  If Congress
acts it may well assign a very central role to the Federal government to
take direct responsibility for reliability.  There are those in the
Department of Energy who are pushing for such a role.   Congressman Barton
is talking of the possibility of emergency legislation, possibly within the
next few weeks.  If the industry pulls together, I believe we can forestall
direct governmental controls, just as in 1965.  If the industry does not
step up, then Congress may well assign the responsibility elsewhere.

The CTG recommended to the Board that a critical mass of six Regions sign
onto the agreement before it goes forward.  For those Regions that are
considering developing their own programs with their members before they
sign the agreement, with the view of having the CAPG determine in advance
whether their programs meets the requirements of the agreement, I ask you
to consider this:  If we don't get a critical mass of Regions to sign, then
the CAPG may not come into existence.

The NERC/Regions agreement is really an undertaking by the regions to work
to develop their own regional compliance and enforcement program with their
members.  My request remains that each of the regions sign the agreement by
the March 30 Board meeting.  That will assure that we are able to make the
governance changes that we have all been working for.  If any region is
unable to sign by March 30, then use of the letter of intent would be a way
to demonstrate support for the program.  That may be enough to satisfy
those who have stated that moving forward on the compliance program is a
condition to their support of the governance changes.

Thanks very much for your consideration of the program and all the work
you've put into this transition so far.  Please let me know if you have
questions or if there is anything that we can do from here to be of
assistance to you.

In light of the Commerce Committee Hearing and the FERC Hearing on the 11th 
and 12th, wanted to provide a quick synopsis of the CPUC Hearing in SD.

It was the same quasi-legislative format as the previous hearing.  Speakers 
were invited by the Commission and only the ALJ and the Commissioners could 
cross-examine the witnesses.  Commissioners Lynch and Wood presided.  Michael 
Kahn, chairman of the Electricity Oversight Board was there and participated 
in some cross-examination as well.

Speakers were:

ISO:  
Kellan Fluckiger, COO
Anjali Sheffrin, Director of Market Analysis
Frank Wolak, Chairman of Market Surveillance Committee

Cal PX:
David Jermain, former VP, Compliance, Audits & Reg. Affairs
Seth Wilson, 

South Coast Air Quality Management District:
Carol Coy, Deputy Executive Director

CPUC:
Harvey Morris, Principal Attorney

SDG&E:
Donald Garber

ISO's main message was that many factors contribute to the high prices in the 
wholesale market:

 1.  Demand growth over past two years at or around 5% (98-99, 99-00)
 2.  Lack of generation additions in entire west
 3.  Reduced imports of electricity from NW, due to low hydro and policy to 
retain water in spring.
 4.  Natural Gas price increases over 1999, at almost 2x's 1999 levels in 
August
 5.  Nox emissions trading at or around $40/pound
 6.  Increased underscheduling from June-August

ISO has concluded that the reduction in the price caps (from $500 to $250) 
have increased the overall cost of electricity, with the highest total 
cost/MWh ($180) experienced in August, relative to $167/MWh in June and $118 
in July.  Reason given is that the caps have reduced markup (could be 
interpreted as generator profit) in peak hours, but supply costs have been 
driven up in lower load hours.  

While ISO staff said they will seek an extension of its authority from FERC 
to be set price caps, also raised concerns about the affect any further 
reductions would have on the market.  They conclude that such a reduction 
would deter new investment,  preclude generators from recovering fixed costs 
of production, and increase dependence on OOM purchases (as a result of lower 
imports).

ISO staff will make a proposal to the ISO Board, October 6, to do the 
following:

1.  File for extension of price cap authority to FERC.
2.  Request FERC to institute mandatory forward contract requirement on 
generators for a significant portion of their capacity.
3.  CPUC should allow full peak requirements to be forward contracted and 
hedged by UDCs
4.  CPUC and state should promote price responsive demand programs
5.  Maintain sufficient planning reserves.

ISO Staff also stated that:

1.  Need to create disincentive for underscheduling for load and generation
 a.  Charge OOM cost to underscheduled load
 b.  Charge replacement reserve cost to underscheduled generation
 c.  Additional charge for real-time market transactions

2.  Attract and expedite new resources

MARKET POWER:

While the Commissioners spent the majority of the day picking apart the 
underlying reasons for the rise in prices, the conclusion of the hearing was 
President Lynch asking the ISO and PX to name names on who has been exerting 
market power.  Both the PX and the ISO said that it would be impossible to 
determine from the information they have.  Secondly, the analysis they have 
done show that no single market participant is consistently exhibiting the 
ability (opportunity) to exercise market power.  Therefore, at one point or 
another, nearly every market participant has market power.

Wolak suggested that in order to reduce the amount of market power in peak 
periods, require forward contracting OR increase profit incentives in 
off-peak period, where generators many times sell below short-run marginal 
costs.

No further quasi-legislative hearings are planned.","CPUC Hearing in SD on 9/8.

M=09ENT DISCUSSIONS ONLY
Importance:=09High

Attached are three documents (cover memo, draft settlement proposal,
settlement procedures timeline) comprising SRP's formal proposal to resolve
five pending dockets, RP99-507 (Indicated Shippers' Complaint), RP00-336
(Order No. 637 Allocation and Pooling Issues only), RP99-139 (ONEOK
Complaint), RP01-484 (Indicated Shippers/California Complaint), and RP01-48=
6
(Texas, New Mexico and Arizona Shippers' Complaint). We appreciate the
suggestions received to date and believe that while an uncontested
settlement may be unlikely, a sufficient nucleus is forming around the
elements of this proposal that will lead to the filing of an Offer of
Settlement and ultimate FERC approval as in the public interest.  We
encourage your active participation in this process.

Note that while Advisory Staff present at the July 18 Technical Conference
is aware conceptually that SRP will be distributing a settlement proposal,
this proposal has not been distributed to the Advisory Staff.  This proposa=
l
has been sent to Rick Miles, Director, Dispute Resolution Services, for
informational purposes only at this time.

Do we need to specifically rebut this?  Enron did file a study to support the natural markets of the SE, and, while we generally have stated responses to his issues in various forums, do we need to respond item by item?  (FYI--I have never heard the ""lake"" analogy before -- his characterization of it as the opponent position helps his case, but it is incorrect because as far as I know, there is no one proposing a system that ignores constraints).

Also, we have not focused much recently on the transmission pricing issues.  This may be an opportunity to discuss this in context.  He seems to use it as a reason against the Southeast RTO.

Below is a link to Southern Co. CEO Allen Franklin's prepared testimony at the Barton hearing last week (October 10).  He says they favor wholesale competition, but he then goes on to talk about the virtues of geographically smaller RTOs, with a phased approach of smaller RTOs that could later merge to become larger (although the Barton discussion draft would prevent such mergers).  The statement also chronicles their involvement in the Southeast mediation process.

In his oral testimony, Franklin kept ephasizing the lack of FERC cost/benefit studies on RTOs and the similar (alleged) lack of studies and analysis to support the 4 RTO model.

give better sales presentations
hone their management skills
work better with fellow employees
offer constructive criticism
accept criticism more objectively.  

Before I begin trying to work out all of the ""details"" of this new organization, I would like to know how many, if any, of you have ever participated in this organization or would like to join.  Additionally, if you are interested in joining, please let me know your preferred meeting times (generally meetings are an hour to an hour and a half) such as at lunch or work.

Jeff --

Our Internal Communications group is continuing to look for ways to 
communicate with employees in a timely manner about hot topics that are of 
interest to them.  We're also looking to increase your exposure with 
employees.  We have a new idea, which Sherri discussed briefly with you a 
couple of weeks ago.  It's called ""Jeff's Corner"" and it will be a regular 
video message that will be posted on the intranet -- which can be accessed by 
99.9% of our employees.  

This is how it will work.  We will tape a 2-3 minute video of you talking 
about what's top of mind at that moment.  The tone and style will be like 
your floor meetings (one of your best employee venues), casual and 
conversational.  We suggest the first topic be ""The State of Enron.""  There 
is a lot of talk among employees about the cheap shots we've taken as a 
company and by you and Ken, about the decline in our stock price and about 
the widespread re-deployment efforts.   These recent events are  beginning to 
affect morale.  Employees are concerned and want to be assured that we're on 
the right side, that they will have jobs, that Enron will be here next year.  
You've helped reassure them about these things at recent floor meetings; 
however, that is only a small part of our global work force.  Having your own 
corner on the intranet will have a farther reach, and we have the capability 
to do this in-house at very low cost.  

We recommend making this a regular communication feature at least monthly, 
although since this would only involve a few minutes of your time, you could 
even tape a message to employees weekly.  The nice thing about this medium is 
we have the ability to respond immediately to current events, and having you 
speak to employees gives the message credibility.  

Future topics could address new cost saving procedures, update on Dabhol, the 
PRC, reasons behind an organizational announcement, The Pulse survey, etc.  
We'd like this to be a forum where you can talk about topics you'd like to 
discuss.

I've checked with the technical team, and we have the capability do this 
now.  I will check your calendar with Sherri.  Let me know if you have any 
questions.

Mary

Portland, Ore.-Based Firm Says California Has Capacity for Electricity Needs
Dan McSwain , North County Times, Escondido, Calif.

( October 17, 2000 )



Oct. 13--PORTLAND, Ore.--A private investigation of state power markets has 
come to the conclusion that California had plenty of electricity generating 
capacity this summer.

The state enjoyed a 32 percent reserve margin even as wholesale prices soared 
and the state's power manager declared 36 separate ""power emergencies"" 
because California was thought to be in the grips of a critical shortage, 
according to the investigation.

The author of the investigation's preliminary report, Portland-based 
economist and utility industry consultant Robert McCullough, said at a 
conference of analysts, power traders and electricity industry regulators 
Thursday that he has found evidence that generators and trading companies 
manipulated the production of power from June through August to create a 
false shortage and push up prices.

The Encina power plant in Carlsbad provides a stark example: it ran at well 
below its full capacity for much of June, even though wholesale power prices 
---- and consumer electricity bills ---- shot to well above the generating 
plant's cost of production.

The actual production of electricity by the plants was determined by an 
analysis of data from the Environmental Protection Agency, which monitors 
emissions.

""We are seeing a lot of under-generation,"" McCullough said. ""This is market 
power in action.""

Market power is a term used by economists to describe the ability of market 
participants -- in this case suppliers -- to influence prices.

Many of the industry experts present at the conference Thursday reaffirmed 
their belief that supply shortages were very real this summer, and 
contributed to high prices, but several participants said deregulation has 
reduced the amount of market information that is available to analysts. 
Mainstream economists have questioned the accuracy of data from federal 
agencies, including the EPA.

Conventional explanations for the low energy production observed in San Diego 
County are scant.

Encina's operators, a joint venture of energy giants Dynegy Inc. and NRG 
Energy Inc. called Cabrillo Power, confirmed that the power plant had no 
abnormal maintenance problems. The San Diego Regional Air Quality Board said 
Wednesday that the power plant was well within its state-mandated pollution 
limits.

But David Lloyd, the corporate secretary of Cabrillo, denied that the Encina 
plant has been used to game the San Diego County power markets.

""That can't possibly be right,"" Lloyd said of McCullough's analysis. ""In 
North County, we were right on the ragged edge of being off (an emergency 
shutdown because of heavy output).

""Without knowing the specific details of time and which units were on or off, 
I can't comment,"" Lloyd said.

""We certainly don't want to be accused of anything wrongful,"" he said. ""We 
don't have that much power in California, and for us to be shutting down in 
California to push up the price somewhere else doesn't make sense for us. We 
want to run all we can when the prices are high.""

Electricity prices have soared to record levels since May, resulting in a 
doubling and tripling of power bills this summer for the 1.2 million 
customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Co. and causing an estimated $5 billion 
in losses for Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric.

State lawmakers have intervened on behalf of San Diego County consumers with 
a retail rate cap, but the law in turn created a looming IOU that could grow 
beyond $300 million if high wholesale prices persist.

No fewer than five private, state and federal investigations are under way to 
assess the competitiveness of power markets in the interconnected Western 
states. The investigations also seek to answer charges that the companies 
which produce and trade electricity have either figured out how to exploit 
deregulated markets to outmaneuver regulators or have engaged in outright 
manipulation in order to increase profits.

Inquiries by the California Public Utilities Commission, Electricity 
Oversight Board and attorney general, along with a Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission investigation, were launched in July and August. Staff 
investigators of the state and federal commissions said this week that they 
are still in the process of issuing subpoenas and gathering market data.

McCullough was hired in late May by the Seattle city utility and a consortium 
of large industrial power consumers in the Pacific Northwest to investigate 
the price spikes. His effort is thought to be the first to complete an 
exhaustive analysis of state and federal information that tracks the amount 
of electricity that was available and compares it to the amount of power that 
was actually used.

Chief among McCullough's findings was that demand for power was lower this 
summer than what was forecasted by the Western Systems Coordinating Council, 
a federal agency that is charged with ensuring the stability of the vast web 
of power transmission lines that connect California to 13 other Western 
states, British Columbia and northern Mexico.

McCullough provided a copy of his preliminary findings Tuesday to the North 
County Times, and the initial reaction of the state's energy community was 
one of deep skepticism.

""EPA data is notoriously unreliable,"" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford professor 
and the chairman of the market surveillance committee of the California 
Independent System Operator, the agency that manages the state grid and which 
has paid enormous sums for emergency power this summer. To gauge the actual 
output of power plants that burn fossil fuel, McCullough used emissions data 
from the EPA.

""Greed would get the best of anybody,"" Wolak said. ""I found a lot of hours 
where in-state generators were exceeding nameplate capacity. These guys were 
cranking it out.""

Wolak, in a study of power markets for the system operator, did conclude, 
however, that exercise of market power by power generators and traders was 
the major cause of higher prices this summer.

At the conference in Portland, most of the panelists did not openly criticize 
McCullough's analysis, but implicitly disputed his conclusions by attributing 
higher prices and the presumed exercise of market power to a very real 
shortage of electricity generating capacity among the Western states.

Low hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest and high temperatures 
in the Southwest were blamed for limiting California's ability to import 
electricity.

Others said state and federal regulators, along with market participants 
themselves, won't really know what happened until more experts look at hard 
market information that is in short supply.

Ron Eachus, the chairman of the Oregon Public Utilities Commission, said 
market information is routinely withheld from regulators, the public and 
buyers of electricity, but is shared among power generators and trading 
companies.

""If the market is sharing it with themselves, but not us, I don't buy that,"" 
Eachus said.

Tim Belden is the vice president of West Trading for Enron North America, the 
largest marketer and trader of electricity in the world. Enron takes the 
unique stand that more information which has been labeled ""proprietary"" by 
companies, such as when a plant is being run and how much the electricity is 
selling for, should be made available instantly to the markets.

""Is there a smoking gun out there or are market participants behaving 
rationally?"" Belden said.

""California is characterized by secret, black box market models that nobody 
understands,"" he said. ""If you've got nothing to hide, release the data.""

Subject:	California Refund Proceeding--Got some exhibits to prepare--Confidential Atty Client Work Product

I met with Gary Fergus and we determined the  need to prepare affidavits and/or exhibits as part of our August 15th showing in the Califronia refund case. 

Exhbits in a FERC case require supporting documents and a sponsor (witness).

 I am trying to contact various people on getting the data together but here are the parameters of the exhibits:

Witness designations are preliminary.

1. EPMI's receivables from ISO/PX
What it shows:  ISO owes us $41.5 million and the PX $9.1 million plus any claims we want to make w.r.t. letters of credit with the PX
Sponsor: Tracy Ngo (PX data) and Murray O'Neil (ISO data)  (Tracy has agreed to prepare the exhibit but wants support from Murray's group on the ISO numbers.) 

2. EPMI's ""receivables"" from ISO for the underscheduling penalty
What it shows:  ISO has yet to actually implement the underscheduling penalty but has been tracking it.  According to information provided Chris Stockly, EPMI would receive $30 million of penalty revenues 
Sponsor:  Chris Stokley or Murray O'Neil

3. Enron's PX credit receivables
What it shows:  PG&E and SCE collectively owe EES $500 million
Sponsor: Steve Swain or ??

Dear Ken, 

I'm not sure quite were to turn but was hoping you could assist me.  I would like to keep this confidential especially regarding the New York Office.  As my request has nothing to do with the people in this office or the group  they are wonderful

I've been with Enron since '97 and I relocated up to Connecticut to work with the New Power Company when I thought that the Enron employees would stay Enron employees.  Afterwards of course we all were changed to NewPower employees.  After a couple of months I made the move back to Enron and went to  the New York office and work with the Enron Metals group here at 53rd street. (It was never my intention to leave Enron)

Since the bombing I feel very displaced and my husband and I would really like to come back to Houston and was wondering if you could help me.  I was on the trading floor working with Dave Delainey's group when he was in ENA and also was the Exec Secretary/Coordinator with the MWB group in George Warsoff's group.  

I would appreciate it very much if you were able to assist/guide me.

Sincerely,

Teri

Forecasting Challenges in Electricity Markets
2001 Electric Market Forecasting Conference
Skamania Lodge, Washington      ?       September 12-14, 2001 
[IMAGE]
Today's electricity markets are more challenging to predict than ever. Discover the keys to managing risk in volatile energy markets.
The conference venue is the beautiful Skamania Lodge in the scenic Columbia River Gorge--45 minutes East of Portland International Airport, Portland, Oregon.  A mind expanding setting for an executive-and professional level exchange of information and strategies concerning North American energy markets. 
Navigating Today's Energy Markets
The challenges of taming energy markets don't begin and end in California. Volatility and risk are present in every market region, forcing all participants to carefully examine the underlying factors and accurately assess their current and future market positions. 
For the 4th year, EPIS, Inc., developer of the AURORA? electric market model, has assembled a stimulating program of interest to any company exposed to energy market risks.  This year's agenda includes a detailed look at the various energy trading regions in the U.S. and Canada - an exploration of market conditions and market dynamics. 
This year's conference will feature thoughtful exchanges on:
Electric and Gas Markets - 2001 and Beyond
U.S. Markets: Crisis in the West, Emerging Issues in the East and ERCOT
Keys to U.S. Electric and Gas Forward Markets
Issues in Canadian Markets
Gas Hedging Strategies and Electric Markets
Price and Volume Volatility in Turbulent Markets
New Resources: When and Where to Develop?

You'll hear from top-level speakers representing companies that have been there - Williams Energy Marketing, FPL Energy, NYMEX, ENRON, DTE Energy, Deutsche Bank and others. Plus there will be informative ""roll-up-your-sleeves"" sessions on applied forecasting techniques by Williams Energy Marketing, Pinnacle West, GenerSys, Southern California Edison.

Great summary.  I think the two main issues you raise are the right ones, b=
ut I have one other thought we should discuss internally.  Do we want to cr=
eate a set of incentives for the management of PJM that would entitle manag=
ement to incentive compensation to the extent they meet certain goals -- eg=
 relieving congestion on the grid, increasing throughput across the transmi=
ssion system, expediting interconnection (measured in terms of actual inter=
connections not just applications approved), etc.  This way we could create=
 an organization that would have the incentive to make a workable and open =
transmission system.

","Re: PJM RTO Order. Great summary. I think the two main issues you raise are the right ones, b= ut I have one other thought we should discuss internally. Do we want to cr= eate a set of incentives for the management of PJM that would entitle manag= ement to incentive compensation to the extent they meet certain goals -- eg= relieving congestion on the grid, increasing throughput across the transmi= ssion system, expediting interconnection (measured in terms of actual inter= connections not just applications approved), etc. This way we could create= an organization that would have the incentive to make a workable and open = transmission system.

Announcing the Formation of One Corporate Equity Investing Unit

To better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to our 
core businesses, Enron has formed one corporate equity investment unit.  This 
new unit, Enron Principal Investments, will combine the existing investment 
units of ENA, EBS and Enron Investment Partners.  Additionally, the Enron 
Special Asset Group will also become part of Enron Principal Investments.  
The strategy of Enron Principal Investments will be to work with all the 
business units of Enron to identify, execute, and manage equity investments, 
which leverage Enron's unique and proprietary knowledge.   These investments 
may be in the form of venture capital, LBO's, traditional private equity and 
distressed debt positions.   

Kevin Garland will serve as Managing Director, overseeing all activities of 
Enron Principal Investments.  Gene Humphrey, Michael Miller, Dick Lydecker, 
and their groups, will join Kevin and his group to form Enron Principal 
Investments.  This new business unit will report to an investment committee, 
consisting of Greg Whalley, Ken Rice and Dave Delainey. 

 Please join me in congratulating and supporting Kevin, Gene, Michael, Dick 
and the other members of this group in this effort.

I arrived in the US on Saturday with a good feeling about what appears to be 
a successful resolution of the Chorety crisis.  Under Steve Hopper's 
leadership, the Chorety spill became a non-issue by Friday.  During the 
crisis, I collaborated with my counterpart from Shell/London, Michael 
Megarry, in developing a Key Messages and Internal Q&As document (attached).  
At the daily meeting/conference call, there was an Operations Report from the 
site, an analysis of the day's newspaper articles (which I handled), and 
discussions on how to respond to media that were reporting or airing 
inaccurate information that was damaging Transredes' image.   

I also developed a Stakeholders Action Plan (attached) for the Incident 
Commander to use in organizing and monitoring team member actions taken in 
response to stakeholder concerns.  The Plan was updated daily by the 
Transredes PR Office and given to team members prior to every 
meeting/conference call.   The Stakeholder Report is intended to complement 
the Operations Report.  

I also want to acknowledge the support of Karen and Dennis during the early 
stages of the crisis.  It was extremely helpful.

Dear Mr. Kean:

I would like to thank you and Mark Schroeder very much for your time and
outstanding hospitality in Houston.  I very much enjoyed meeting with you
and your message, that your Chairman Kenneth Lay confirmed for dinner with
our Mayor Petra Roth was very well received and we are all very excited and
looking forward to November 30.

However it raises great interest in the question of organization of the
dinner and the additional participating chairpeople of other companies. Wil=
l
Enron now invite for that dinner, which I understand will be the gathering
of 10-12 major decision makers in the energy field? If you could be so kind
as to share with us the thoughts of Ken Lay=01%s office with regards to tha=
t
point, or give me a contact there, I would very much appreciate.

An alternative we discussed or as an addition the next day (Lunch), would b=
e
that a business-group would host an event, which could include a wider
audience of business people of Houston.  After having spoken with the Germa=
n
Consulate in Houston and with the German American Chamber here, it
unfortunately appears as if they will not be capable for s.th. we achieve.
Everybody recommended to work with the reputative Greater Houston
Partnership, whose President was on vacation last week.  I would welcome an=
y
assistance in getting us in contact with them.  Probably it would not take
too many efforts for Enron, to have them consider supporting out idea of
promoting our ideas. To help you pass them, I again include our plan for
Houston (see attached doc).

I will be in contact with your colleague Mark Palmer with regards to the
press-coverage. Thank you for your response to your earliest possible
convenience.

Yours Sincerely

panel from Missouri that did a fantastic job of supporting FERC and market =
postitions despite the fact that he is a public power guy.  His name is Bil=

on to talk about how Missouri is going to continue to suffer from seams iss=

He stated that ""flexible"" standardization would not work and that the FERC =
should put out a platform of standardized tariffs and if there was some uti=

I'm thinking that this gentlemen would be an excellent choice for a committ=

General Observations


=20

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left la=
te in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, t=
he commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of=
 all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; =
much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seeme=
d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo=
rward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover for=
ward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha=
t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t=
o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was d=
iscussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the=
 reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticea=
ble conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two org=
anizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20

=20


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=
eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =
felt was critical. =20

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panel=
ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=
y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=
ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varie=
d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=
or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=
ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=
followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=
nt situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=
t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=
 throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue =
a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you=
 need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =
wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=
o say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=
 little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=
t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=
he need for cautious investigation. =20

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=
heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=
e ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the que=
stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=
os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =
a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=
ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =
questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=
r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=
s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=
 be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=
edule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=
ing from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are a=
llowed)?=20


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =
services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues=
 to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=
ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=
re those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?=
 Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=
, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=
dules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =
in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary=
 services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=
ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? =
 Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=
ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=
ly unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=
d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =
non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=
reat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=
l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =
to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=
, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will t=
ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financi=
al hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =
about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =
to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=
red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=
on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=
 said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =
believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=
hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=
ion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=
tting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a bea=

FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, t= he commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of= all questions. There was a general consensus that standards were needed; = much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seeme= d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo= rward and how far they needed to go. Panelists urged the need to mover for= ward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha= t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t= o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward. There was d= iscussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the= reins in the future. On an interesting tangential note, there was noticea= ble conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two org= anizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20 =20 FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne= eded from the Commission. Staffers probed all panelists to find what they = felt was critical. =20 The first major topic was ""How many RTOs? What is their scope?"" All panel= ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b= y FERC, in strong definitive language. N o one offered any specific langua= ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement. The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?"" Panelists varie= d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent. Some urged f= or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta= ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (= followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre= nt situation. The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha= t the industry needed to move forward. They continually visited this topic= throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue = a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you= need us to provide?"" General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they = wanted strong leadership in this areas. Kormos and Burkes went so far as t= o say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a= little further."" Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu= t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t= he need for cautious investigation. =20 One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc= heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th= e ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the que= stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design. Korm= os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying = a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry. The se= ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following = questions: ? Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu= r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i= s nonetheless efficient? Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there= be others that must be accommodated? ? Transmission Service - Are transmission services required to sch= edule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect= ing from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are a= llowed)?=20 ? Loop Flows - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission = services appropriate? If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues= to be addressed? ? Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr= ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti= re those contracts? Are there other solutions? ? Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?= Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)= , be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche= dules), or will they be required at all? ? Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed = in standard ways? Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary= services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina= ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)? ? Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? = Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce= ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical= ly unwieldy? ? Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate= d into the new world? Should systems be designed with the assumption that = non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO? Or should they be designed to t= reat each NJE as a separate entity? Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica= l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which = to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions= , pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will t= ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financi= al hedging instruments"") will take only months. The Commission asked Mike = about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible = to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed. Now for a funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer= red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati= on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest. Kormos flat out= said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't = believe that that statement is true."" He then backpedaled a bit and said t= hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert= ion by the Northwest interests was false. NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se= tting organization. Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a bea= uty contest between NERC and GISB?"" Cook and Boswell then went into severa= l short polite jabs at each other's organizations.

Attached is the proposed Stip to allow PJM to move forward as an RTO.

In the Stip, we argue that PJM should be approved by FERC but condition our 
acceptance on a FERC process to unify the Northeast markets.

My only comment is to delete the final WHEREAS paragraph on congestion 
management.  

While our ability to later stop PJM from being an RTO is limited, I believe 
that this gives us the ability to drive a consolidation of the Northeast 
markets - which is one of the goals of the East Power desk.

In addition, I think that the overall direction of PJM in commercializing its 
software is a good activity for our interest - even if we don't want 
everything in their package.

Sarah is out until Monday when we need to get back with PJM.

HEADLINE: Southern Co., Regulators Clash in Power-Grid Fight 

BYLINE: By Matthew C. Quinn 

BODY: 
Southern Co. appears to be on the verge of losing a big-money power struggle over control of its four-state electricity transmission system. 

But both sides in the tug-of-war offer different takes on which result would help consumers and which would hurt them. 

At issue are long-distance transmission lines, mounted on huge steel towers, that carry electricity across state lines to towns and cities. Atlanta-based Southern Co. has invested $ 3 billion in its 26,000-mile system, but federal regulators want it to cede control to a larger agency that covers eight states. The matter is coming to a head now after three years of wrangling. 

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission wants to carve up the country into four regional transmission organizations, or RTOs, for the Southeast, Northeast, Midwest and West. Under such a plan, local utilities like Southern would be unable to stop competing power shipments from out-of-state suppliers. 

Regional transmission organizations ""yield significant customer savings,"" said FERC Chairman Pat Wood III. Commission spokeswoman Barbara Connors said lower rates will result when barriers to competitively priced electricity from outside the region are dropped and transmission costs reduced. 

But there are sharp differences of opinion on that score. 

Andy Dearman, Southern Co.'s chief transmission officer, cites estimates that a super-regional agency could cost more than $ 100 million to establish, and he says those costs could be passed on to consumers in the form of higher rates. According to Georgia Power Co., a Southern Co. subsidiary, transmission costs already account for about 6.5 percent of Georgia electricity bills. 

There's also a question of reliability when a new system is established, Dearman saud. ""It impacts the ability to keep the lights on,"" he said. 

Some state regulators, who stand to lose regulatory control, see a Washington power grab. 

""We've got low prices and a reliable system,"" said Georgia Public Service Commissioner Stan Wise, who sees a back-door move toward utility deregulation of the sort that has failed with electricity in California and been severely tested with natural gas in Georgia. 

""Don't tell me about the new system when I've got blood on my face from the last battle,"" Wise said. ""There are some parallels that make us squirm."" 

PSC Chairman Lauren ""Bubba"" McDonald wrote President Bush following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks urging a delay. ""This is not the time to consider or implement any change to the management of the nation's transmission grid,"" he said. 

But the federal commission has only toughened its position. 

Wood, a Texan recently named chairman by Bush, said last month he wants to use the commission's authorities as a ""stick"" to force reluctant utilities into line. Wood would deny utilities that refuse to join a ""new world"" of regional power grids by Dec. 15 the authority to charge deregulated prices and delay merger approvals for those firms. 

The commission plans a series of workshops in Washington next week for what Wood called the ""brightest minds available"" in the utility field to brainstorm over transmission reorganization plans. Southern Co. is sending a representative. 

Companies like Enron Corp., the Texas-based national energy suppler, are pressing for RTOs as the first step toward a national transmission grid -- a concept favored by the Bush administration. 

Prodded by federal regulators, Southern Co. in June agreed to dilute its control over the 26,000-mile system by joining with public power agencies in five states to form a larger, 39,000-mile transmission agency to be operated by an outside company. But a federal mediator rejected the plan. 

The issue has also split Southern Co. from onetime subsidiary Mirant Corp., an independent power company with plans to expand into the Southeast. 

Large regional grids are ""more cost-effective and reliable"" than the present territorial hodgepodge, said Mirant spokesman Buddy Eller. 

By encouraging development of new and cleaner power plants, the environment would benefit too, he added. 

But Wise called such predictions ""totally unproven.""

Officials in California and Nevada, after months of lobbying for federal re=
gulators to cap Western power prices, warned yesterday that the newly impos=
ed limits have had the unintended consequence of increasing a threat of bla=
ckouts in the two states.=20
The warnings were issued as California came within minutes of rolling black=
outs yesterday afternoon, and one day after the first-ever rolling blackout=
s in Las Vegas forced energy-hungry casinos to shut off fountains and reduc=
e air conditioning.=20
The two states are asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take =
a closer look at the so-called price mitigation plan and come up with revis=
ions that would deter power companies from withholding electricity during s=
hortages.=20
""We need some clarity to this order,"" said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for t=
he California Department of Water Resources, which is spending billions of =
dollars to keep the state's lights on.=20
""Generators need to be held accountable,"" he said.=20
The crux of the problem is that price limits kick in during shortages, yet =
power companies say these caps force them to sell power at below-market rat=
es during periods of high demand.=20
Some companies have responded by holding back power rather than face the ex=
pense of shipping electricity from state to state. Each mile that electrici=
ty must be transmitted adds to the overall cost.=20
""No one's going to pay for transmission if the cost is near the caps,"" said=
 Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an e=
nergy-industry association in Menlo Park.=20
Ackerman said several companies in his organization decided that there was =
no economic advantage to offering power in regional markets when price cont=
rols are in effect.=20
""This means individual regions like California or Las Vegas could end up no=
t having enough,"" Ackerman said. ""It increases the threat of blackouts.""=20
BLACKOUT ALERT CANCELED
California authorities issued a blackout alert at 1:45 p.m. yesterday when =
power reserves dipped to dangerously low levels. They canceled the alert ab=
out an hour later, after finding additional supplies.=20
""Everyone in the West is fighting for megawatts,"" said Stephanie McCorkle, =
a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator, which oversee=
s the state's power network.=20
The Golden State's latest brush with lights-out conditions came a day after=
 Nevada experienced its own rolling blackouts for the first time, prompting=
 heavy power users such as the MGM Grand and Caesars Palace to dim their li=
ghts.=20
Don Soderberg, chairman of the Nevada Public Utilities Commission, said tha=
t the sudden power emergency took state authorities by surprise and that th=
ey are investigating to see what role the federal price limits may have had=
 in exacerbating Monday's shortage.=20
""We're looking very closely at this,"" he said. ""There seems to be a potenti=
al for unintended consequences.""=20
Specifically, Soderberg said Nevada is focusing on operators of older, less=
- efficient plants who would find profit margins shrinking, if not vanishin=
g, under capped prices.=20
""We're going to see how the caps might have played into this,"" he said.=20
The federal ceiling in 10 Western states, excluding California, is about $9=
2 per megawatt hour. In California, a 10 percent surcharge is added because=
 of the state's credit risk, bringing the price to just over $101.=20
Ackerman at the Western Power Trading Forum said regional price controls ha=
ve extended California's power crisis to neighboring states.=20
""California sneezed and the rest of the region caught the virus,"" he said.=
=20
'LAWYERS LOOKING FOR LOOPHOLES'=20
California and Nevada officials, however, said that they still have faith t=
hat price limits can stabilize Western electricity markets but that federal=
 regulators may have to tweak the system so that power companies cannot wit=
hhold output.=20
""The generators have banks of lawyers looking for loopholes (in the plan),""=
 said Hidalgo at the Department of Water Resources.=20
Unfortunately, it may take some time for the regulators to revisit an issue=
 that they took up only with the greatest reluctance. For months, federal r=
egulators refused to impose price controls, preferring instead to let suppl=
y and demand determine costs.=20
Hidalgo said that when it appeared that power companies were throttling bac=
k on output Monday, California officials immediately dialed the hot line nu=
mber provided by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in case of emerge=
ncies.=20
""No one answered,"" he said. ""They were closed.""=20
State officials tried again yesterday, and this time were told that the com=
mission would look into the matter. They were not given a time frame for wh=
en the commission might come up with a response.=20

Out-of-state generators pull plug over uncertainty on price controls
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 3, 2001)=20
Confused by the federal government's new controls on electricity prices, ge=
nerators withheld so much power from California on Monday that the state wa=
s nearly plunged into rolling blackouts, state officials said.=20
The confusion began when the state's electric grid operators declared a Sta=
ge 1 power alert in the early afternoon, triggering the price caps for the =
first time since they went into effect June 21.=20
Out-of-state generators pulled about 1,500 megawatts of electricity off the=
 table at midafternoon, enough to power about 1.1 million homes, because of=
 uncertainty about how much they could charge under the new Federal Energy =
Regulatory Commission pricing system, said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesperson for =
the state Department of Water Resources. The department buys electricity fo=
r the state's financially distressed utilities.=20
""They didn't understand what they were going to be paid; there was confusio=
n over the FERC order,"" Hidalgo said. ""We saw 1,500 megawatts disappear.""=
=20
The problem was exacerbated by a heat wave across the West, which forced Ca=
lifornia to compete with other states for scarce electricity, he said. Roll=
ing blackouts hit southern Nevada.=20
Most California officials credit the FERC system, which is based on a varia=
ble price cap, with reining in what had been a runaway wholesale power mark=
et. But power generators have complained that the price caps, by limiting p=
rofits, could discourage the production of critically needed electricity. A=
nd as Monday's episode suggested, even the uncertainty about where the cap =
will fall could lead to unexpected shortages.=20
""That's the risk that you run (with price controls),"" said Arthur O'Donnell=
, editor of the newsletter California Energy Markets. ""People want any kind=
 of certainty at all.""=20
Hidalgo said the state avoided blackouts only because of last-minute import=
s from the Bonne=07ville Power Administration, the federal agency that mark=
ets government-produced hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest. The s=
tate went into a Stage 2 power alert, the next-to-last level before blackou=
ts are ordered. The alert was canceled in late afternoon.=20
The blackouts would have been the first in California since May 8.=20
FERC imposed a round-the-clock ceiling on power throughout the West. The pr=
ice fluctuates and is tied to the production costs of the least-efficient p=
lant operating in California during a ""power alert"" declared by the Indepen=
dent System Operator, which runs the state's power-transmission grid. When =
there's no alert, prices can't exceed 85 percent of the cap that was establ=
ished during the latest alert.=20
Until Monday, the maximum price held steady at about $101 a megawatt-hour i=
n California. But when the ISO declared a Stage 1 power alert in early afte=
rnoon, signifying that reserve supplies had dwindled to less than 7 percent=
 of demand, confusion set in, Hidalgo and others said.=20
Because of a steep drop in the price of natural gas, which fuels many Calif=
ornia power plants, suppliers knew the cap would fall. But no one knew by h=
ow much until the price was posted by the ISO.=20
The ceiling for California fell to about $77 at 3 p.m. but was back up to $=
98 in two hours, according to the ISO. Those prices include the 10 percent =
premium that sellers can charge California because FERC said there's a cred=
it risk in selling to the state.=20
O'Donnell said it's likely suppliers will pull back from the market every t=
ime the ISO declares a power alert.=20
In-state generators have to operate their plants if summoned by the ISO. Bu=
t out-of-state suppliers can withhold supplies, and on Monday it was the ou=
t-of-staters that were pulling back, Hidalgo said.=20

Power Sales Halted by New Pricing Curbs=20
Electricity: Confused suppliers, unsure what they will be paid, refuse to s=
ell to state, which asks FERC for a ruling but doesn't get it.=20

By NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writer=20

     SACRAMENTO--Confusion over new federal price restrictions prompted sev=
eral electricity sellers to back away from sales to California on Monday af=
ternoon, pushing the state closer to blackouts, energy officials said.
     The state lost sales that would have provided enough electricity to su=
pply more than 1 million homes, said Ray Hart, deputy director of the Calif=
ornia Department of Water Resources, which has been buying much of the stat=
e's electricity since January.
     At least five companies producing or marketing power ""are telling us t=
hat since they don't know what they're going to get paid, they're not going=
 to take the risk, and so they're not going to sell the energy,"" Hart said.
     The electricity sales fell through after power consumption soared in s=
ummer heat and grid operators were forced to declare a Stage 1 emergency, m=
eaning reserves had dipped below 7%. It was the first such emergency since =
May 31.
     Under a June 19 order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission inte=
nded to bring down wholesale electricity markets across the West, a power e=
mergency in California triggers the setting of a new price limit that appli=
es to power plant owners from Washington to Arizona.=20
     The new price is supposed to be based upon whatever it costs to run th=
e most inefficient, expensive power plant selling electricity to California=
 grid operators during the first full hour of a Stage 1 emergency.
     But much uncertainty remains about exactly how and when the new price =
is supposed to be established under the commission's order, and that appare=
ntly drove away sellers, Hart said.
     Shortly after the state issued the Stage 1 alert at 1:30 p.m., putting=
 the old price limit of $90 per megawatt-hour in question, companies that h=
ad committed to provide the state electricity hour by hour Monday afternoon=
 backed out, Hart said. The companies include TransAlta Energy Marketing of=
 Oregon, Constellation Power of Baltimore and Sempra Energy Trading, a unit=
 of the San Diego-based energy conglomerate.
     Forced to dip even deeper into the state's power reserves and declare =
a Stage 2 emergency, water agency officials called the federal energy commi=
ssion's hotline for clarification about what the new price should be and wh=
en it should take effect. They got no answer.
     Hart said commission officials reached at home promised to try to clar=
ify their order today. One outstanding question is what obligations power s=
uppliers have to deliver electricity to California in an emergency.
     Both buyers and sellers in the market agree that the new price, when i=
t is set, will probably be lower than $90 per megawatt-hour because the pri=
ce of natural gas, the main fuel in California power plants, has dropped la=
tely.
     Temperatures soared several degrees higher Monday than grid operators =
had anticipated. But they said they expected to avoid rolling blackouts in =
part because the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland, Ore., had agr=
eed to provide several hundred megawatts of Pacific Northwest hydropower ea=
ch hour in exchange for a return of electricity from California later this =
summer.
     ""Bonneville is giving us emergency power to get us through,"" Hart said=

Roll= ing blackouts hit southern Nevada.=20 Most California officials credit the FERC system, which is based on a varia= ble price cap, with reining in what had been a runaway wholesale power mark= et. But power generators have complained that the price caps, by limiting p= rofits, could discourage the production of critically needed electricity. A= nd as Monday's episode suggested, even the uncertainty about where the cap = will fall could lead to unexpected shortages.=20 ""That's the risk that you run (with price controls),"" said Arthur O'Donnell= , editor of the newsletter California Energy Markets. ""People want any kind= of certainty at all.""=20 Hidalgo said the state avoided blackouts only because of last-minute import= s from the Bonne=07ville Power Administration, the federal agency that mark= ets government-produced hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest. The s= tate went into a Stage 2 power alert, the next-to-last level before blackou= ts are ordered. The alert was canceled in late afternoon.=20 The blackouts would have been the first in California since May 8.=20 FERC imposed a round-the-clock ceiling on power throughout the West. The pr= ice fluctuates and is tied to the production costs of the least-efficient p= lant operating in California during a ""power alert"" declared by the Indepen= dent System Operator, which runs the state's power-transmission grid. When = there's no alert, prices can't exceed 85 percent of the cap that was establ= ished during the latest alert.=20 Until Monday, the maximum price held steady at about $101 a megawatt-hour i= n California. But when the ISO declared a Stage 1 power alert in early afte= rnoon, signifying that reserve supplies had dwindled to less than 7 percent= of demand, confusion set in, Hidalgo and others said.=20 Because of a steep drop in the price of natural gas, which fuels many Calif= ornia power plants, suppliers knew the cap would fall. But no one knew by h= ow much until the price was posted by the ISO.=20 The ceiling for California fell to about $77 at 3 p.m. but was back up to $= 98 in two hours, according to the ISO. Those prices include the 10 percent = premium that sellers can charge California because FERC said there's a cred= it risk in selling to the state.=20 O'Donnell said it's likely suppliers will pull back from the market every t= ime the ISO declares a power alert.=20 In-state generators have to operate their plants if summoned by the ISO. Bu= t out-of-state suppliers can withhold supplies, and on Monday it was the ou= t-of-staters that were pulling back, Hidalgo said.=20 The Bee's Dale Kasler can be reached at (916) 321-1066 or dkasler@sacbee.co= m .=20 Power Sales Halted by New Pricing Curbs=20 Electricity: Confused suppliers, unsure what they will be paid, refuse to s= ell to state, which asks FERC for a ruling but doesn't get it.=20 By NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writer=20 SACRAMENTO--Confusion over new federal price restrictions prompted sev= eral electricity sellers to back away from sales to California on Monday af= ternoon, pushing the state closer to blackouts, energy officials said. The state lost sales that would have provided enough electricity to su= pply more than 1 million homes, said Ray Hart, deputy director of the Calif= ornia Department of Water Resources, which has been buying much of the stat= e's electricity since January. At least five companies producing or marketing power ""are telling us t= hat since they don't know what they're going to get paid, they're not going= to take the risk, and so they're not going to sell the energy,"" Hart said. The electricity sales fell through after power consumption soared in s= ummer heat and grid operators were forced to declare a Stage 1 emergency, m= eaning reserves had dipped below 7%. It was the first such emergency since = May 31. Under a June 19 order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission inte= nded to bring down wholesale electricity markets across the West, a power e= mergency in California triggers the setting of a new price limit that appli= es to power plant owners from Washington to Arizona.=20 The new price is supposed to be based upon whatever it costs to run th= e most inefficient, expensive power plant selling electricity to California= grid operators during the first full hour of a Stage 1 emergency. But much uncertainty remains about exactly how and when the new price = is supposed to be established under the commission's order, and that appare= ntly drove away sellers, Hart said. Shortly after the state issued the Stage 1 alert at 1:30 p.m., putting= the old price limit of $90 per megawatt-hour in question, companies that h= ad committed to provide the state electricity hour by hour Monday afternoon= backed out, Hart said. The companies include TransAlta Energy Marketing of= Oregon, Constellation Power of Baltimore and Sempra Energy Trading, a unit= of the San Diego-based energy conglomerate. Forced to dip even deeper into the state's power reserves and declare = a Stage 2 emergency, water agency officials called the federal energy commi= ssion's hotline for clarification about what the new price should be and wh= en it should take effect. They got no answer. Hart said commission officials reached at home promised to try to clar= ify their order today. One outstanding question is what obligations power s= uppliers have to deliver electricity to California in an emergency. Both buyers and sellers in the market agree that the new price, when i= t is set, will probably be lower than $90 per megawatt-hour because the pri= ce of natural gas, the main fuel in California power plants, has dropped la= tely. Temperatures soared several degrees higher Monday than grid operators = had anticipated. But they said they expected to avoid rolling blackouts in = part because the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland, Ore., had agr= eed to provide several hundred megawatts of Pacific Northwest hydropower ea= ch hour in exchange for a return of electricity from California later this = summer. ""Bonneville is giving us emergency power to get us through,"" Hart said= .=20 Copyright 2001 Los Angeles Times=20 James D Steffes 07/06/2001 10:04 PM To:=09Jeffrey T Hodge/Enron@EnronXGate, Robert C Williams/Enron@EnronXGate cc:=09Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Linda R= obertson/NA/Enron@ENRON, Alan Comnes/Enron@EnronXGate, Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enr= on@Enron, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron, Robert Frank/NA/Enron@Enron, Ray Alvarez/N= A/Enron@ENRON, Sarah Novosel/Corp/Enron@ENRON, dwatkiss@bracepatt.com=20 Subject:=09ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGDE - Draft FERC Brief on Settlement Proc= ess The attached is a rough draft of a potential filing Enron would make in to = Judge Wagner in the Settlement process (it is unclear if this would remain = confidential per the gag order).

>
</redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custo
> m/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=ENRNQ>), after Jeffrey K. Skilling
> resigned unexpectedly as chief executive on Aug. 14. Its author was later
> identified as Sherron S. Watkins, a vice president for corporate
> development at Enron. The House Energy and Commerce Committee released
> excerpts of the letter on Monday and the full letter yesterday:


> Has Enron become a risky place to work? For those of us who didn't get
> rich over the last few years, can we afford to stay?
> Skilling's abrupt departure will raise suspicions of accounting
> improprieties and valuation issues. Enron has been very aggressive in its
> accounting - most notably the Raptor transactions and the Condor vehicle.
> We do have valuation issues with our international assets and possibly
> some of our EES MTM positions.
> The spotlight will be on us, the market just can't accept that Skilling
is
> leaving his dream job. I think that the valuation issues can be fixed and
> reported with other good will write-downs to occur in 2002. How do we fix
> the Raptor and Condor deals? They unwind in 2002 and 2003, we will have
to
> pony up Enron stock and that won't go unnoticed.
> To the layman on the street, it will look like we recognized funds flow
of
> $800 million from merchant asset sales in 1999 by selling to a vehicle
> (Condor) that we capitalized with a promise of Enron stock in later
years.
> Is that really funds flow or is it cash from equity issuance?
> We have recognized over $550 million of fair value gains on stocks via
our
> swaps with Raptor. Much of that stock has declined significantly - Avici
> by 98 percent from $178 million, to $5 million; the New Power Company by
> 80 percent from $40 a share, to $6 a share. The value in the swaps won't
> be there for Raptor, so once again Enron will issue stock to offset these
> losses. Raptor is an LJM entity. It sure looks to the layman on the
street
> that we are hiding losses in a related company and will compensate that
> company with Enron stock in the future.
> I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting
> scandals. My eight years of Enron work history will be worth nothing on
my
> r?sum?, the business world will consider the past successes as nothing
but
> an elaborate accounting hoax. Skilling is resigning now for ""personal
> reasons"" but I would think he wasn't having fun, looked down the road and
> knew this stuff was unfixable and would rather abandon ship now than
> resign in shame in two years.
> Is there a way our accounting guru's can unwind these deals now? I have
> thought and thought about a way to do this, but I keep bumping into one
> big problem - we booked the Condor and Raptor deals in 1999 and 2000, we
> enjoyed wonderfully high stock price, many executives sold stock, we then
> try and reverse or fix the deals in 2001, and it's a bit like robbing the
> bank in one year and trying to pay it back two years later. Nice try, but
> investors were hurt, they bought at $70 and $80 a share looking for $120
a

Causey
> will sit down and take a good hard objective look at what is going to
> happen to Condor and Raptor in 2002 and 2003?
> Summary of Alleged Issues:
>
> RAPTOR Entity was capitalized with LJM equity. That equity is at risk;
> however, the investment was completely offset by a cash fee paid to LJM.
> If the Raptor entities go bankrupt LJM is not affected, there is no
> commitment to contribute more equity.
> The majority of the capitalization of the Raptor entities is some form of
> Enron N/P, restricted stock and stock rights.
> Enron entered into several equity derivative transactions with the Raptor
> entities locking in our values for various equity investments we hold.
> As disclosed in 2000, we recognized $500 million of revenue from the
> equity derivatives offset by market value changes in the underlying
> securities.
> This year, with the value of our stock declining, the underlying
> capitalization of the Raptor entities is declining and credit is pushing
> for reserves against our MTM positions.
> To avoid such a write-down or reserve in quarter one 2001, we ""enhanced""
> the capital structure of the Raptor vehicles, committing more ENE shares.
> My understanding of the third-quarter problem is that we must ""enhance""
> the vehicles by $250 million.
> I realize that we have had a lot of smart people looking at this and a
lot

Waste

> I firmly believe that the probability of discovery significantly
increased

> Summary of Raptor Oddities:
> 1. The accounting treatment looks questionable.
> a. Enron booked a $500 million gain from equity derivatives from a
related
> party.
> b. That related party is thinly capitalized with no party at risk except
> Enron.
> c. It appears Enron has supported an income statement gain by a
> contribution of its own shares.
> One basic question: The related party entity has lost $500 million in its
> equity derivative transactions with Enron. Who bears that loss? I can't
> find an equity or debt holder that bears that loss. Find out who will
lose
> this money. Who will pay for this loss at the related party entity?
> If it's Enron, from our shares, then I think we do not have a fact
pattern
> that would look good to the S.E.C. or investors.
> 2. The equity derivative transactions do not appear to be at arms length.
> a. Enron hedged New Power, Hanover and Avici with the related party at
> what now appears to be the peak of the market. New Power and Avici have
> fallen away significantly since. The related party was unable to lay off
> this risk. This fact pattern is once again very negative for Enron.
> b. I don't think any other unrelated company would have entered into
these
> transactions at these prices. What else is going on here? What was the
> compensation to the related party to induce it to enter into such
> transactions?
> 3. There is a veil of secrecy around LJM and Raptor. Employees question
> our accounting propriety consistently and constantly. This alone is cause
> for concern.
> a. Jeff McMahon was highly vexed over the inherent conflicts of LJM. He

> b. Cliff Baxter complained mightily to Skilling and all who would listen

> c. I have heard one manager-level employee from the principal investments

LJM?

The EPSA leg. affairs cmt. met today during the fall meeting.  The speakers were Howard Useem, Republican counsel to the Senate Energy Committee, and Jimmy Glotfelty, senior policy advisory to the Secretary of Energy.

Useem said Senate Energy Committee Republicans were meeting later this morning to finalize their energy proposal.  (We later learned that they opted against including any electricity provisions, not even the PURPA, PUHCA and reliability issues that Howard thought might be included when he spoke before the senators met; this is good news since it makes it less likely that anti-FERC provisions will be added.) (Howard said now is the best time to legislative on electricity because the Supreme Court has not yet acted on the bundling/unbundling issue.)

On RTOs, in some what of a surprise, Useem said that there is general support among Senate Republicans for RTOs, including consolidating them into a few RTOs of large scope (surprising since this is not what we have heard in meetings with individual Senate offices).  While he said that, he also said that support is stronger in the abstract than in specifics.  He said the biggest opposition was coming from very vocal state regulators (EPSA staff did a good job of pointing to state regulators, mainly in the Midwest, who support larger RTOs).  Most importantly, Howard said none of the senators on his committee take a ""not over my dead body"" approach to RTOs.

Jimmy Glotfelty explained to several EPSA members who asked questions just why it is that the Administration wants Congress to be silent on RTOs.  He said while they would prefer a sentence or two affirming FERC's authority, they do not believe this is what would come out of the legislative process.  They are not willing to run that risk.  He stressed that the president wants to include other electricity issues.  He said they were very close to an agreement with Western governors on regional transmission siting.  

Jimmy further said that the Administration also wants silence on incentive rates, another issue where FERC can act now.  They continue to talk to Barton and his staff in an attempt to get them to back away from the restrictive approach to RTOs in the Barton discussion draft.  (He said Pat Wood spent several hours with Barton and other House committee staff yesterday.)

Of concern, Jimmy said something like ""could be 4 RTOs, could be 8 RTOs,"" what is important is getting standard design.  He also said DOE will make sure that PMAs are included in RTOs.

> The choice of Joe Lieberman of Connecticut as Al Gore's running mate is so
> smart, so clever, so good, so satisfying, so striking that it just may
> turn
> this election a bit on its head for a while. Certainly its most immediate
> effect is going to be a successful Democratic convention next week in Los

> presidential candidate, have something to cheer about. They respect Joe
> Lieberman. They think he has a center, a moral and ethical view of the

> is
> independent. The media love him. He is a regular co-star on Imus, and all
> of
> the columnists and reporters for the elite newspapers, and all of the
> electronic pundits and anchors, know him and admire him.
> But that is not what is most wonderful. What is most wonderful is that he
> is
> an Orthodox Jew. What does this mean? It means a lot of people who love
> America more than they love parties or politics are happy that a big and
> great breakthrough has occurred. A friend, a journalist who is politically
> conservative and Jewish, e-mailed me to tell me he had been weeping all
> morning, that he'd cried when he heard the news. Another friend, a
> producer at a TV news show, called and told me she woke her father in
> California to give him the news and they both got choked up. ""This is like
> 1960,"" she said, and I said I know, and I got choked up. It is wonderful
> when America is at her most American, and breaks down another barrier and
> says ""What's in your heart is most important.""
> If Joe Lieberman had been Joe Lee, and an Episcopalian, Al Gore would have
> been smart to pick him. He would have been an obvious choice. The only
> reason he would have hesitated over Mr. Lieberman is that he's Jewish. Mr.
> Gore decided that was just fine. I think that I have never seen Al Gore do
> such an elegant, intelligent and original thing. Well done, Mr. Gore.
> I have to tell you, this really does feel like a 1960 moment to me. I was

> It opened things up more. That was a good thing. So is this.
> And because this is such a good thing, I hope everyone of whatever

> However, I think it's okay and maybe even helpful to note the following.
> Network producers are going to decide, in their bright and touchingly
> uninformed minds, that the big opponents of the Lieberman choice will be
> Christian conservatives. That's where they'll go for the negative sound
> bites. But Christian conservatives love Joe Lieberman. They've been arm in
> arm with him in the great cultural battles of the past decade. He was just
> about the only Democrat who'd give them the time of day. He was on their
> side.
> The last time I saw Mr. Lieberman was last spring, in New York, at a

> co-warriors in the values battle. Lieberman and Bennett very frankly
> talked
> to the audience of producers and writers and network people and movie
> stars about how to make television and film and music more decent, more

California Changes Stance on Refunds 
Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks 
By Peter Behr
Washington Post Staff Writer
Friday, July 6, 2001; Page E01 
California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to 
recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity, saying 
they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 
billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year.
Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is 
seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term 
contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for 
Davis. 
""We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get 
us $8.9 billion,"" Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. 
""You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you 
want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion.""
The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a 
California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close 
to the negotiations.
Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the 
amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach 
a compromise.
""What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood,"" Wagner told 
reporters. ""In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I 
may offer a preliminary assessment."" The settlement conference is set to 
conclude on Monday.
Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides 
toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. 
Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California's largest utility, 
drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at 
sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on.
Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn, 
chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid 
manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in 
refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said.
Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for 
all sides, is closed to the public and media.
Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and 
his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a ""joke"" that the 
parties might as well wear ""clown suits,"" according to a Dow Jones report 
confirmed by sources close to the talks.
But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant 
Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for 
failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers 
have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off 
various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said. 
Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's 
commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but 
now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California's 
electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher 
refund figure, some energy analysts believe.
Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an 
overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have 
to pay for energy under those deals.
California's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed 
deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at 
volatile ""spot market"" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so 
did the state's electricity bills. 
In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating 
long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so 
far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power 
for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. 
That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was 
paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and 
considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy 
analysts say.
A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political 
pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's 
controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that 
reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count 
as a ""refund"" because the deals were reached ""under commercial duress,"" 
according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations.
Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. 
""There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be,"" said 
Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. 
The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a ""just and reasonable"" 
standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the 
overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure.
""It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate,"" 
said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight 
committee for the California grid.
Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room 
""billions of dollars apart,"" as the talks approached their final weekend, 
sources said.

I am not sure I understand your second paragraph.  If PG&E reduces going-forward procurement costs to reflect FERC-ordered refunds, I do not understand why it would affect already-issued CTC charges.  The cost of power would be cheaper going forward.

Thanks for the thoughts.  I fully agree on BF costs and DWR costs.  I believe that you are right on Est RT$ = CAISOM Imbalance, but I need to check.

On the question of retroactive ratemaking, it is my understanding that you are correct.  PG&E probably won't rebill, but will need to put in place an adjustment to the going forward PX Credit to ""collect"" the overpayment of Negative CTC.

All of this means that the impact of the FERC refund is less than 100c on the $ for the Negative CTC.

I assume that if an hourly PX market clearing price is mitigated per a FERC order it would affect variable ""HC"" in the formula laid out in the attachment.

It is not clear to me which  variable represents hourly ISO imbalance energy costs, but I assume its ""Est RT$"".  If I am right, that variable would be affected by  the mitigated market price (MMP) for CAISO imbalance energy.

My comments are:

The FERC is able to only order refunds to jurisdictional entities and, given appeals, it may take years before the full extent of thre refunds are known.  Therefore there will be a significant difference between the change in the mitigated market price (MMP) as declared by FERC and the PX credit.  That is, a 10% reduction in the MMP should not be construed as having a 10% effect on the PX credit, assuming it can be recalculated at all.  Specifically, only some of the ""HC"" or  ""Est RT$""  costs can  be adjusted per FERC refund orders.

Also, the PX credit is a tariffed rate.  I do not believe the PU code allows for retroactive adjustments to tariffed rates unless there was an explicit cost tracking account (e.g. a balancing A/C).  To my knowledge, no such account exists here.  

Finally, I do not see a relationship between MMPs and (1) block forward costs on any date and (2) PG&E and/or DWR's procurement costs for the net short position post January 19.  So, those PX credit costs should be unaffected by any FERC refund order.

No.  We have reallocated some of the responsibilities, but Cindy has a significant part of the HR organization and continues to manage Community Relations, so her title is accurate.  Thanks

In our litigation meeting last Tuesday, we learned that netting of spot purchases and sales is of paramount importance in limiting our exposure to refunds, under the FERC's July 26 Order, in both the California and Pacific Northwest proceedings.  However, in the California proceeding we are also afforded the opportunity in the Order to offset our receivables against any refund that would otherwise have to be paid by us.  Also, to the extent that our receivables exceed the refund amount, the Order provides for payment of interest to us in accordance with CFR Section 35.19a.  

At present, I am aware of the existence of three receivables.  As you will recall, I mentioned at Tuesday's meeting that we should be able to treat as a receivable for purposes of offset, the revenues due us from the application of the CAISO underscheduling penalty.  I communicated the possibility of offsetting this receivable against any potential refund at this mornings Western Wholesale conference call, and subsequent research conducted by Alan Comnes indicates that the CAISO owes us $30MM, as per the CAISO's own numbers.

The CAISO also owes us approximately $40MM due to nonpayment for one to two months of business.  These two figures alone, totalling approximately $70MM, exceed the estimate of our potential exposure in the California proceeding.

Finally, the negative CTC issue is another receivable due us by IOU's that, under the plain language of the Order, could potentially be used to offset any refund amount.  I am not aware of the magnitude of this receivable but do understand that there are some sensitivities regarding this issue, including concerns about revealing the amount of the credit due us.  It is likely that the amount would become public if it is presented in the California proceeding.

Please give us your thoughts as to the use of the CTC receivable to offset potential refunds in the California proceeding.","FW: California Refund Proceeding Privileged and Confidential Attorney Work Product Attorney-Client Communication. -----Original Message----- From: Alvarez, Ray Sent: Thursday, August 02, 2001 3:32 PM To: Sanders, Richard B.; Williams, Robert C.; gfergus@brobeck.com Cc: Steffes, James D.; Comnes, Alan; Robertson, Linda; Shapiro, Richard; dwatkiss@bracepatt.com Subject: California Refund Proceeding Privileged and Confidential Attorney Work Product Attorney-Client Communication In our litigation meeting last Tuesday, we learned that netting of spot purchases and sales is of paramount importance in limiting our exposure to refunds, under the FERC's July 26 Order, in both the California and Pacific Northwest proceedings.

when we are done, I will forward it along to the group.  So as not to hold

the Assembly and the Senate in California, along with short summary of what 
each piece of legislation purports to do.

With Dereg Under Fire,Enron Calif Elec Business Heats Up
By Jason Leopold

09/14/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

  LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- While federal regulators try to find a way to
stabilize soaring wholesale electricity prices in California, Enron Corp.
(ENE) has been quietly striking up deals with some suburban communities to
sell them fixed-price power at a lower rate.

  In the past month, the Houston-based electricity service provider entered
into long-term fixed-rate contracts with the city of Roseville and is
negotiating similar deals with the cities of San Marcos and Chula Vista. Both
of those cities currently get their power from San Diego Gas & Electric Co, a
unit of Sempra Energy Inc. (SRE), and pay market rates for electricity.
  Enron has also struck a deal with Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc.
(HOT), one of the world's largest hospitality companies, to sell the company
electricity at a fixed rate for the next 10 years. The company has four hotels
in California, three of which buy their power from SDG&E.

  Sources close to the matter said Enron has contracted to sell the hotel
power at about 6 cents per kilowatt-hour, compared with the 22.5 cents/KWh
Starwood said it was charged by SDG&E in August.

  Neither company would disclose the terms of the deal. But Starwood said it
expects to reduce its energy costs by more than $200 million over the next 10
years.

  Enron, the largest trader of electricity and natural gas in the U.S., will
purchase power to cover such contracts on the wholesale markets and use its
experience to manage the risks, while paying a fee to utilities like SDG&E for
use of their distribution networks.

  ""That really is our core strength,"" said Harold Buchanan, chief operating
officer for Enron Energy Services North America. ""We understand how to manage
those risks.""

  High Rates Driving Industrial Customers, Cities To Switch

  The growing interest in fixed-price supply contracts is fueling a comeback
of sorts for Enron.

  The Houston-based company had tried to break into California's retail power
market just after deregulation, even spending nearly $1 million to advertise
the venture during the Super Bowl. But Enron gave up trying to win residential
customers in 1998, citing disappointing response and lower-than-expected
profits.

  That was when deregulation and competitive power markets were full of
promise. Oddly enough, now that deregulation is coming under attack in
California, soaring power prices are building demand for Enron's services.

  The company is fielding calls from large industrial customers in San Diego
that have seen their utility bills triple in the past three months and are
interested in signing long-term fixed-rate contracts, Buchanan said.

  ""Overall, what Enron can provide is reliability pricing in San Diego that's
written in stone,"" Buchanan said. ""It's far cheaper than what they're paying
now with the utilities.""

  A number of large industrial customers negotiating with Enron declined to
comment.

  The city of Roseville, near Sacramento, entered into a $114 million contract
with Enron last month to purchase 50 megawatts of electricity for five years
at $49 per megawatt-hour.

  Furthermore, the city has started talks with Enron about building and
operating a 750-megawatt natural gas-fired power plant that city officials
expect will contribute to lower costs for the purchase of electricity.

  Mayor Harry Crabb said the plant could protect residents from the price
spikes that have plagued customers of SDG&E since June.

  San Marcos, in San Diego County, is proposing to switch electricity service
for its 10,000 residents to Enron from SDG&E - a move the City Council said
could shave about $12 million a year off the city's power bill. Enron has said
it would offer the city terms nearly identical to those it offered Roseville.

  An SDG&E spokesman said last week that the utility supports such
arrangements, saying they're one way deregulation is supposed to work.

  Enron offered earlier this summer to sell power to SDG&E itself for four
years at a fixed rate of 5.5 cents/KWh, but the utility said the price was too
high.

  California Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation two weeks ago to cap
electricity rates for SDG&E's customers at 6.5 cents/KWh.

Subject:=09Transatlantic meetings

To the Executive Committee:

Attached is a note that has been sent to our managers regarding off-site an=
d team-building meetings.  My impression is that our commendable efforts to=
 build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many get-togethers that=
 require substantial travel.  Our challenge is that such gatherings are far=
 more costly and time-consuming for us to attend than our Houston colleague=
s might realize.  Often, participating in these meetings takes an entire we=
ek for Enron Europe employees (especially if they are outside of Texas). Na=
turally, they may feel that this time of year (PRC time) is exactly the wro=
ng time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering.

These off-sites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter, which comp=
ounds the difficulty; worse still are the times they occur at the end of Q2=
, since it also coincides and conflicts with the PRC process.

I would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the tra=
vel time and costs (both direct and indirect) when inviting international e=
mployees to off-site meetings in the US.  We appreciate the chance to be in=
cluded in the broader Enron initiatives and to share ideas across organizat=
ions, but we are really trying to reinforce the message about managing expe=
nses.

Thanks!

John Sherriff


(Letter sent to all Enron Europe VPs and direct reports)

We still have issues regarding Offsites and 'Team Building' exercises.  In =
particular, we have recently had examples of departments failing to inform =
other key work groups when workplace absences are pending.

In order to avoid misunderstandings, and to increase transparency, the foll=
owing will apply with immediate effect:

Any Offsite or 'Team Building' exercise which any group (both commercial an=
d non-commercial, and including John and myself)intends to undertake must b=
e communicated, in advance, to all department heads. Issue to be identified=
 include:  all participants who will out of the office, total costs of the =
exercise; and, where appropriate, work load coverage details.

John and I are very supportive of team building exercises but we much prefe=
r that they be conducted in the evenings or at weekends. To the extent that=
 is not possible, we must absolutely avoid quarter ends and ensure all work=
 is appropriately covered.

Trips to Houston and especially resorts in the US are far more difficult to=
 justify based on the substantial travel time and costs involved.  So pleas=
e pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel.

Please communicate this policy to your staff.

Michael Brown

Mark and Steve, sorry to bother you with this, but I'm at a loss.  This guy 
(Jim Cofield) called me on my cell phone last night about 7:00 p.m. to get my 
e-mail address.  He asked that I take a look at his e-mail in the morning and 
route it to the appropriate person within Enron.  

The "".jpg"" files below have no information in them, but the "".doc"" file is a 
14 page document with numerous correspondence from Mary Beth Cahill, former 
director in the White House Office for Public Liaison, to Mr. Cofield 
regarding a trip to Nigeria that he supposedly accompanied President Clinton 
on several months ago; followed by a number of ""proprietary information 
documents"" that mean absolutely nothing to me; followed by an overview of 
Nigeria's electrical power situation; etc....The best I can tell, they are 
trying to get Enron to bid on some project in Nigeria.

Since this e-mail is copied to the Vice President of the United States in 
addition to several ambassadors, I thought it might need attention.  If you 
can figure it out, please let me know how to proceed.  Thanks, SRS

Dan Douglass summarized this.  This really puts CA and the ISO on notice that 
they cannot confiscate the power as they seem ready to do -- FERC reiterates 
that the generators can sell power wherever they want because the cap is a 
cap on ISO purchases.  ANd if the ISO want to set a sale price cap it has to 
file with FERC, wait 60 days and amend its contract

Subject: FERC Order on Morgan Stanley Complaint Against ISO


We have good news on the ISO price caps front.  The FERC has made it
clear that ISO does not have the ability to mandate that generators sell to 
ISO at its price caps and that the proper response to inadequate supply is to 
lift the price caps.

On Friday, the FERC issued its Order on Complaint in connection with the July 
10 complaint filed by Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. (""MS"").  As you may 
recall, MS requested FERC to issue a stay of the ISO's maximum purchase price 
authority and to direct the ISO to reverse any price cap reductions.  MS 
sought Fast Track processing pursuant to Rule 206(h), which was granted by 
FERC on the grounds that the complaint ""warrants expeditious action.""

As a quick background summary for you, last November, FERC issued an order 
approving Tariff Amendment 21 which extended ISO's price cap authority 
through 11/15/00.  That order stated that the ISO ""maximum purchase price was 
not a cap on what the seller may charge the ISO, but a cap on what the ISO 
was willing to pay.""  The Commission said that sellers dissatisfied with the 
price cap could ""choose to sell those services into the California Power 
Exchange or bilateral markets.""

FERC notes in Friday's Order that the 6/28 the ISO's Board resolution lowered 
the caps to $500 and ISO further directed that, ""To the extent permitted by 
law, regulation and pre-existing contract, Management shall direct generators 
to bid in all their capacity when system load exceeds 38,000 MW.""

The MS complaint alleged that the cap reduction was unlawful and would, 
""threaten the stability and integroty of the marketplace.""  MS also requested 
an emergency technical conference to examine ISO's justification for the 
price cap reduction.

FERC denied the MS stay request, as well as its request that the $750 maximum 
purchase price be reinstated.  The Commission reiterates that it is not 
approving a cap on sellers' prices, because they can sell at whatever price 
they want.  Rather ISO has simply stated the maximum price it is willing to 
pay.  ""Because sellers are not required to sell to the ISO, the ISO cannot 
dictate their price.""

Importantly, however, FERC also states that, ""ISO has no more or less ability 
to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these services....if 
the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced 
purchase price ceiling (because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they 
choose), it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to 
meet its needs.""  [Emphasis added]  FERC then notes that this may lead to an 
increase in Out of Market (""OOM"") calls and that OOM calls are not subject to 
a maximum purchase price.

Also, with regard to the ISO's resolution stating that generators must bid 
their capacity into the ISO markets when system load exceeds 38,000 MW, FERC 
states clearly that, ""such a requirement is not permitted by our November  12 
Order and the ISO tariff.""  [Emphasis added]

FERC goes on to say that any requirement to sell to ISO in conjunction with a 
maximum purchase price would require significant revisions to ISO's market 
rules, which could not be made effective without a corresponding amendment to 
ISO's tariff.  This would require 60 days' advance notice, ""and could not be 
implemented prior to Commission approval.  As stated above, our November 12 
Order was clearly based on the premise that the proper response to inadequate 
supply (due to a low maximum purchase price) is to raise the maximum purchase 
price.""

ISO is then ""put on notice that any amendment to mandate sales must be 
accompanied by a demonstration that this extreme measure is the proper 
response to low supplies in the ISO markets.""

Concurrences were filed by Commissioners Massey and Hebert.  Massey suggests 
that the state has to facilitate solutions to market issues, such as risk 
management tools, removing constraints on hedging opportunities, introducing 
real time pricing through real time metering and expediting approval of new 
generation and transmission projects in California.  Hebert says that the 
previous November Order tried to ""straddle the fence"" and that, ""Today, the 
Commission at least starts to lean slightly in the right direction of 
recognizing that we have a role.""  He then reiterates his preference for 
removing all price caps.  He also suggests that, ""Getting to the bottom of 
the problem, in my view, requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our 
approval of the ISO as operator of the California grid.  The record supports 
such a move.""  He refers approvingly to the Collins resignation letter, 
stating that it, ""thoughtfully outlines consequences to the market of a 
return to 'command and control.' ""  Hebert states that, ""The independence of 
the ISO's governing structure stands threatened.  We should 'stand up,' to 
quote the resignation letter.""  Hebert advocates opening a section 206 
proceeding now, as part of the recently announced inquiry into bulk power 
markets, ""including the California markets.""

This decision makes it clear that ISO cannot lower the caps at tomorrow's 
meeting and expect that sellers will be required to sell to it at that 
price.  This is an important development and very good news in our ongoing 
efforts to seek economic sanity at the ISO.

Please call if you have any questions.

Dan

Carolyn and Cynthia,

       You should write this letter on your letter head and direct it to Joe
Jaso and copy Tom DeLay, Jim Ellis, and myself. All funds where money could
be left in the State of Texas from corporate and personal should be included.

Dear Joe:

       Enron, Mr. Ken Lay and Mr. Skilling are requesting that their
contribution be matched per our understanding from the fax and verbal
communications from Warren RoBold. This totals $100,000 between both
individuals and the Corporation for the RNSEC matching funds program. We want
these funds matched in time for the Texas State deadlines. It was our
intention from the onset of this program to have our funds go to this
account. The various points of contact from the RNC caused some minor
confusion so checks went to Texas instead of DC. This is very important to
Mr. Lay and Mr. Shilling.
        Let us know if we need to request these funds returned and new checks
written and mailed to you at your DC address. You may call me if you have any
questions.

Two more say Duke withheld power: The company says it was responding to the 
state grid operator.
By Kevin Yamamura
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published July 6, 2001) 
Two more former workers from a Duke Energy power plant came forward Thursday 
to bolster recent claims by colleagues that the power generator withheld 
production to drive up prices. 
But Duke attributed witness accounts of fluctuating generation to 
instructions from the state's transmission-grid operator. 
Richard J. Connors, an auxiliary operator, and E. Robert Edwards, an 
electrician, said generation units at Duke's Chula Vista plant sat idle 
during emergency periods for no apparent reason. 
Three of their former co-workers -- two mechanics and a control room operator 
-- told lawmakers two weeks ago that Duke had disposed of new parts and 
varied its production. 
While that testimony drew significant attention, it was countered Monday by a 
report released by the state's Independent System Operator that showed the 
ISO had in fact ordered Duke's up-and-down output Jan. 16-18. 
On Thursday, the Charlotte, N.C.-based company leaned on the ISO report in 
its defense. 
""The ISO could have dispatched those units at will,"" said Duke spokesman Tom 
Williams, referring to unused equipment. 
But Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, who has filed a lawsuit against generators, 
contended that the ISO had based its orders on Duke's dubious bidding 
history. 
""These ISO orders came only after Duke had continuously manipulated the 
market with price-gouging schemes forcing the ISO to regulate production,"" 
Bustamante said. 
Connors and Edwards each worked more than 20 years at the South Bay plant in 
Chula Vista. 
For most of that time, the plant was owned by San Diego Gas & Electric. Two 
years ago, Duke purchased South Bay and retained Connors and Edwards under 
state-mandated agreements that ended in April. 
Edwards said that during power blackouts in January, he saw a 225-megawatt 
unit off-line. Other units, he said, were operating far below capacity. 
""Our No. 1 priority in life was to make money,"" Edwards said. 
Williams rebutted the claims as observations from those ""who did not have the 
complete picture."" 
""It's dead on, dead true that there are times when that plant is not running 
at full capacity and there is a Stage 3,"" Williams said. ""There may be 
blackouts in San Francisco. But the reason why it's not running is because 
the power can't move up Path 15 (a north-south bottleneck)."" 
Bustamante, however, maintained that Duke has continued to manipulate the 
market, calling Connors and Edwards the ""tip of the iceberg"" in the 
price-gouging investigation. 
State Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, chairman of the Senate committee 
investigating price manipulation, said Connors and Edwards may testify before 
lawmakers after further evaluation. 
Dunn added that his committee has talked to potential whistleblowers from 
other power generators who said they have seen production decreases and 
suspicious activities. It is undetermined whether they will testify, he said.

Lockyer seeks SEC investigation of PG&E's financial transfers 
By Ed Fletcher
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published July 6, 2001) 
State Attorney General Bill Lockyer on Thursday asked the federal Securities 
and Exchange Commission to scrutinize financial transfers made to PG&E Corp. 
from its subsidiary that has filed for bankruptcy protection. 
""SEC scrutiny is essential to protect the public interest, ratepayers and the 
people of the state of California,"" Lockyer said in a prepared statement. 
Charges that PG&E Corp. hastened the bankruptcy filing of Pacific Gas and 
Electric Co. have been made before, responded Greg Pruett, a vice president 
of PG&E Corp. 
""That is an issue that has been investigated multiple times by the Public 
Utilities Commission earlier this year, by an Assembly oversight committee, 
and in each of these audits there has been no conclusion that the transfers 
were inappropriate or that they were injurious to PG&E Co.,"" Pruett said. 
In its filing with the SEC, the attorney general's office said that ""without 
meaningful review by the SEC, it cannot be determined what impact the 
transfer of assets ... may have on the financial condition of the bankrupt 
utility."" 
An SEC spokesman said the commission has yet to examine the petition. 
Among other concerns raised by Lockyer's office is the transfer of more than 
$4 billion from 1997 to 1999 to PG&E Corp. from PG&E Co. 
The majority of the $4 billion came from the sales of PG&E power plants, as 
was required by deregulation. 
""The bulk of the money went to pay debt that was incurred to actually build 
those plants,"" Pruett said. 
The rest of the transfers were to pay stockholder dividends, he said. 
PG&E filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April after having run up 
$6.6 billion in debt.

California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer on Thursday asked the Securities and 
Exchange Commission to investigate PG&E Corp. for potential abuses of its 
responsibilities as a utility holding company. 
At issue is a series of transactions over the last several years in which 
PG&E Corp. transferred funds from its utility, Pacific Gas & Electric Co., 
which now is operating under Bankruptcy Court protection. The money--more 
than $4 billion since 1997--flowed to the parent company and to unregulated 
sister companies of the utilities. 
The transfers have been scrutinized by the California Public Utilities 
Commission and the state Legislature with no finding of wrongdoing, said PG&E 
Corp. spokesman Greg S. Pruett. 
The SEC currently exempts PG&E from almost all requirements of the Public 
Utility Holding Company Act because the San Francisco utility operates 
primarily within California . That law regulates transactions between holding 
companies and their utility subsidiaries. 
Lockyer wants the SEC to withdraw PG&E's exemption, citing $13 billion in 
PG&E assets outside of California . 
""All the primary evils addressed by PUHCA are relevant to PG&E Corp.,"" 
Lockyer's petition to the SEC stated. 
In Bankruptcy Court on Thursday, PG&E said it is close to reaching an 
agreement with Calpine Corp. to pay more than $267 million it owes the San 
Jose-based power generator and to preserve contracts for 453 megawatts of 
relatively cheap electricity . 
In all, PG&E buys about 2,600 megawatts of electricity from nearly 25 
alternative generators, which are seeking repayment and release from their 
contracts through Bankruptcy Court.

WASHINGTON -- The federal mediator seeking a settlement for billions of 
dollars in alleged electricity overcharges in California signaled Thursday 
that the talks are in trouble, and analysts said hope for a deal seems to be 
fading. 
Curtis L. Wagner Jr., chief judge of the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission, said he may issue a report on the closed-door talks as early as 
today if he sees no progress. 
""The judge will perhaps issue a preliminary assessment of the talks,"" said 
Tamara Young-Allen, a spokeswoman for FERC. ""He will do this only if he feels 
the talks aren't moving along as he sees fit."" 
Originally, a preliminary report from the judge was not part of the plan. 
Wagner had previously said all sides would labor in private through the 
weekend to try to get a deal by Monday's midnight deadline. If that failed, 
the judge said he would take seven days to craft a proposed settlement for 
FERC's governing board. 
Kit Konolige, a power industry analyst with Morgan Stanley in New York, said 
Wagner's announcement on Thursday amounted to a judicial distress signal. 
""The judge wouldn't say something like this if the parties were close to a 
settlement,"" said Konolige. ""I suppose he may be trying to jump-start things, 
but I think most people believed the sides were so far apart going into the 
talks that it seemed like a long way to go to reach a settlement."" 
Although Wagner has imposed a gag order on participants, several people with 
knowledge of the negotiations said Thursday that major power generators and 
California officials have not budged from dug-in positions since the talks 
began last week. 
They also said the judge is extremely frustrated with the state and with 
several large power suppliers. 
California is demanding $9 billion in refunds. According to sources, the 
generators have offered less than $1 billion. And some major power sellers 
are insisting they do not owe anything. 
Many experts say California has little hope of obtaining the $9 billion since 
only $5.4 billion of that is attributable to sellers under FERC's 
jurisdiction. On the other hand, it seems clear from statements by FERC 
commissioners that the board is prepared to extract significant refunds from 
generators. 
Wagner is said to be probing for a compromise figure between $1 billion and 
$9 billion. It could take the form of a mix of cash payments and discounts on 
long-term contracts for power. 
FERC's governing board ordered Wagner to hold the talks to see if a 
compromise could be struck on three big issues: refunds, guarantees that 
generators will be paid, and ways to shift more of the state's power 
purchases to long-term contracts. 
The board also made clear that it would impose its own settlement if the 
state and power sellers were unable to come to an agreement. 
Wagner said Thursday that if he issues a preliminary report today, he will 
give all the parties a chance to respond publicly on Monday. Such a report 
might embarrass some of the key players, since Wagner is known for his 
plain-spoken conclusions. The judge would then prepare a settlement 
recommendation for the FERC board by July 16. 
However, he also said he is willing to work through the weekend to reach a 
settlement if it appears within striking distance. 
The talks are in a large hearing room on the second floor of the FERC 
building near Washington's Union Station. Access is strictly controlled and 
special badges have been issued to the more than 140 lawyers participating. 
Some people with knowledge of the negotiations said Wagner's threat to issue 
a report may be a bid to see if one of the parties will make a move. 
""It was like a shot across the bow,"" said one source.

Davis energy team denied pay 
State controller says work for Edison is a conflict of interest

N198197.DTL 
Sacramento -- State Controller Kathleen Connell is refusing to pay two former 
Clinton- Gore campaign operatives hired by Gov. Gray Davis, even though one 
of the consultants dropped his Southern California Edison contract amid 
conflict-of- interest allegations. 
Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane were collectively known as the ""Masters of 
Disaster"" for their work in the Clinton White House during various federal 
investigations. They also worked for Vice President Al Gore during the 2000 
presidential campaign. 
Because of their work for Davis, Connell says the contract Fabiani and Lehane 
signed with Edison is a conflict of interest under state ethics rules. Davis 
is negotiating with Edison on a bailout for the utility. 
Late last week, at the bottom of a press release, Davis announced that 
Fabiani was no longer a communications consultant because his work had been 
""successfully implemented."" Lehane, on the other hand, has dropped his 
contract with Edison and signed a new agreement with Davis. 
Lehane's new contract includes reimbursement for travel and meal expenses, 
which he didn't have before, and requires him to work a maximum of 66 hours a 
month at $150 an hour. His total payments are capped at $76,000 for work from 
June 26 to Nov. 20, 2001. 
In his release, Davis said Lehane would be paid the same amount as former 
communications director Phil Trounstine, about $9,900 a month. But Connell, 
like Davis a Democrat, said Trounstine undoubtedly worked more than 66 hours 
in a month for his $9,990. 
""We don't intend to be paying it,"" Connell said of the contract for both men. 
""They represented Southern California Edison. You have to have a singular 
relationship with the state of California and not show a conflict."" 
Previously, the Davis administration said there was no conflict because 
Edison and Davis wanted the same things out of their negotiations. Earlier 
this week, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said attorneys had different 
opinions over whether the two consultants had violated ethics rules. 
Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said the governor had signed an executive 
order allowing him to enter into consulting contracts with anyone he believed 
could help him solve the state's energy crisis. She said Lehane had been 
working full-time on public policy, even though his contract caps his salary. 
The National Tax-Limitation Committee, a Sacramento group that mostly 
monitors legislation, sued last month alleging that Fabiani and Lehane were 
violating the state Political Reform Act because of the Edison contract. 
In a recently filed disclosure statement, Fabiani also listed more than $10, 
000 worth of consulting work for Cisco Systems, another company that 
frequently brings issues before state authorities, including Davis. 
The state Fair Political Practices Commission also is looking into a 
complaint filed by GOP Secretary of State Bill Jones that Fabiani and Lehane 
violated state ethics rules.

Ex-staff speaks out against Duke 
Two more charge prices manipulated 
Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau

N122949.DTL 
Sacramento -- Two more former employees at Duke Energy's Chula Vista power 
plant came forward yesterday with allegations that the company manipulated 
the energy market to drive up prices, although they offered no hard proof and 
little new information. 
Their accusations bring to five the number of Duke plant workers who say they 
observed suspicious behavior, including the disappearance of parts needed for 
repairs, the idling of generators for no apparent reason, and continual 
stopping and starting that critics of Duke suspect was designed to withhold 
power and artificially increase prices. 
E. Robert Edwards, a 50-year-old electrician, related one conversation with a 
Duke foreman sometime in January that prompted suspicion. 
""I asked the foreman why Unit 4 wasn't running,"" Edwards said yesterday at a 
press conference. ""We had a 225-megawatt generator sitting there, and he just 
shrugged his shoulders and said, 'I really can't tell you. I'm not privy to 
that information.' "" 
State lawmakers have been focusing on whether Duke manipulated prices during 
three days in January, when the company at one point offered a single 
megawatt of power for a record-shattering $3,880. Duke says it was following 
orders from the Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power 
grid, 
when it repeatedly turned its generators on and off during those three days. 
An ISO memo recently released by Duke confirms the company's contention it 
was under orders. But January logs from the ISO and the generators don't 
offer an explanation for every allegation of price manipulation, since Duke 
has refused to release a detailed list of the prices it offered and paid 
during that period. 
The two workers who came forward yesterday, Edwards and 46-year-old Richard 
J. Connors, both worked more than 20 years in the business. They left the 
South Bay Plant in Chula Vista in April, two years after Duke purchased it 
from San Diego Gas & Electric as part of deregulation. 
SOME SHIFTS UNPOPULAR
""It is true units were taken offline, mostly on the weekends for whatever 
reason,"" said Connors, a former auxiliary operator. ""It got to the point as 
an operator that you were dreading working swing shifts on Sunday or 
graveyard Monday morning because you knew you were going to be running around 
putting units back online."" 
Edwards said he had seen a company warehouse eventually emptied of parts that 
are used to repair broken generators, although he didn't know where the parts 
went. Forcing a longer wait for repair parts was designed to dry up the power 
supply and push prices higher, lawmakers and other investigators suspect. 
Edwards, however, admitted the warehouse was being cleaned out even when 
SDG&E ran the plant. Duke contends the workers weren't familiar with Duke's 
inventory system and couldn't possibly know why parts were being moved. 
Duke and other energy companies are facing scrutiny by two legislative 
committees, a 19-member Sacramento County grand jury, state Attorney General 
Bill Lockyer, the California Public Utilities Commission and federal 
regulators. 
BUSTAMANTE ALSO SUING
Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, who introduced Edwards and Connors yesterday, also 
is suing a variety of generators in state court for alleged price 
manipulation and bad business practices. He said Edwards and Connors 
""reiterated what we've know all along -- Duke has been gouging California 
consumers through its use and abuse of the South Bay Plant."" 
Duke offers a variety of defenses for its actions during the three days in 
January and throughout the energy crisis. Tom Williams, a spokesman for Duke, 
said Edwards and Connors had offered nothing new yesterday. 
Beyond the ISO's 37 separate orders to stop and start generators during the 
three days in January, Williams said state air regulations required the 
company to shut the plant at certain times because it was running out of 
emissions credits that limit the amount of air pollution it can put out. 
Duke, which controls about 5 percent of the state energy market, also 
contends the state's power transmission lines can't always handle an increase 
in load. 
""Yes, it's true there are times when that plant is not running at full 
capacity, and there is a Stage Three (alert), and there may be blackouts in 
San Francisco,"" Williams said. ""The reason why it's not running is the power 
cannot move up Path 15,"" the transmission line bottleneck near Los Banos.

Vallejo to produce its own energy 
Conservation, generators expected to make city self-sufficient

N138966.DTL 
Vallejo leaders, looking to escape mounting gas and electric bills, are 
planning to build enough new power generators that the city government will 
be self-sufficient when it comes to energy. 
City officials said they believe that Vallejo is the first city in the nation 
to take such an approach. 
""This is going to be a showplace,"" said Scott Sossen, the chief executive 
officer of Edge Capital Group, a funding agency based in Orange County. Edge 
will be supervising the work along with O'Hara Energy Corp. of Nevada. 
The plan comes at a time when the city expects to see its energy costs double 
next year if it continues buying its power from PG&E. 
""It couldn't be more timely,"" said Mayor Tony Intintoli. 
Vallejo leaders are in the process of contracting with private business to 
build new wind, solar and microturbine generators. Construction of a one- 
megawatt solar generator could start within 30 to 60 days. 
Conservation is also part of the plan, and energy-efficiency improvements are 
already under way at Vallejo City Hall and the fire and police stations. 
City officials hope to add enough sources of power generation to make all 
city offices -- which consume about 10 megawatts a year -- self-sufficient by 
the end of the year. 
The Vallejo City Council gave tentative approval to the project late last 
month and will continue its discussions on the plan next week. 
Vallejo taxpayers won't have to pay any money in advance, because Edge will 
finance the project's first $50 million in capital costs. 
In return, a portion of the city's projected financial savings will be shared 
with the Edge and O'Hara. 
""This is a fairly sizable project,"" said Kevin Chambers, the chief executive 
officer at O'Hara. ""Energy-efficient capital is difficult to find because it 
is such a new field."" 
O'Hara is installing high-tech energy management systems at all city-owned 
property to reduce energy consumption. Final sites for the construction of 
new wind, solar and microturbine generators have not been chosen. 
In recent years, the energy bill for Vallejo city government has averaged 
between $2 million and $3 million per year. That includes the police and fire 
departments, City Hall and water-pumping stations. 
Vallejo is part of a group of 50 local governments in Northern California 
that pooled their resources to buy electricity and natural gas, keeping 
prices down. But the group's current contract expires Dec. 30. 
As a result, the city expects its energy bill to double next year, from 9.2 
cents per kilowatt hour to 20 cents per kilowatt hour. 
""It's been very positive what we've been doing, and it hasn't cost us 
anything,"" said City Manager David Martinez. ""We're going to be very 
optimistic that this is going to be a good thing for the city."" 
City officials hope to eventually extend the plan to Vallejo's 4,500 
businesses and 37,000 households.

SEC asked to see if PG&E Corp. violated law with subsidiary 
Published Friday, July 6, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News 
BY JENNIFER BJORHUS 

Mercury News 


California Attorney General Bill Lockyer asked the federal Securities and 
Exchange Commission on Thursday to step in to investigate whether PG&E Corp. 
violated federal law in taking billions of dollars from its bankrupt 
subsidiary. 
``SEC scrutiny is essential to protect the public interest, ratepayers and 
the people of the state of California,'' Lockyer said in a statement. 
More than $4 billion flowed from the Pacific Gas & Electric utility to parent 
PG&E Corp. from 1997 to 1999, according to Lockyer's petition, representing 
nearly 70 percent of the cash that flowed to the parent company during that 
period. PG&E Corp. spent $2.7 billion to buy back its stock, $1.5 billion to 
pay dividends to shareholders and invested $800 million in its other 
subsidiaries, according to the petition filed Thursday in Washington. 
Those figures are similar to figures from a state-ordered independent audit 
of PG&E Corp.'s finances released in late January. 
By moving assets from the utility to other businesses, the company 
potentially harmed the utility and violated the federal Public Utility 
Holding Company Act in several ways, according to the petition. 
The SEC is the nation's top cop for publicly held companies. But the 
commission has not reviewed PG&E Corp.'s asset movements, saying the company 
is exempt from scrutiny under the Public Utility Holding Company Act because 
it's mainly a California operation and such intrastate operations are exempt. 
The attorney general's office argues that PG&E Corp., with more than $13 
billion of its assets outside the state, can no longer claim it is primarily 
an intrastate company. The SEC should step in, it argues. 
The petition surprised PG&E Corp. officials, who said they had no idea the 
attorney general's office had an issue with the company's exemption from the 
federal law, said company spokesman Greg Pruett. 
Pruett said PG&E Corp.'s actions were appropriate because the federal utility 
law only applies if a company has one or more of the following activities in 
several states: electric transmission and distribution, gas distribution or 
utility-owned generation. 
``We have none of those things except in California,'' Pruett said, adding 
that the National Energy Group, a PG&E Corp. affiliate, ``has natural gas 
transmission but no distribution.'' 
``The power plants that NEG owns or operates are not part of a utility and 
thus aren't regulated by PUCHA, and it has an energy-trading arm that is also 
not regulated by PUCHA,'' he said. 
The petition further asks the SEC to order PG&E Corp. to cooperate fully with 
the California Public Utilities Commission. The state commission is 
investigating whether PG&E Corp.'s corporate structure and its relationship 
with its bankrupt utility violate state utility regulations. 
The petition states it expects a response from the SEC within 60 days. 
But SEC spokesman John Heine said there's no statutory deadline for a 
response. He said he had not seen the petition and could not comment.

Judge may speed up electricity refund talks

WASHINGTON -- A federal mediator seeking a settlement for billions of dollars 
in alleged electricity overcharges in California signaled Thursday that the 
talks are in trouble. 
Curtis L. Wagner Jr., chief judge of the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission, said he may issue a report on the closed-door talks as early as

Wagner is said to be probing for a compromise figure that could take the form 
of a mix of cash payments and discounts on long-term contracts for power.














Davis keeps state addicted to fossil fuels 
Published Friday, July 6, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News 
BY JOE COSTELLO 
BEFORE this year's energy ``crisis,'' Gray Davis wanted to be known as the 
education governor. However, Davis and his advisers' energy teachings have 
revealed alarming failures, setting back state energy policy not one or two 
years, but one or two decades. 
While George W. Bush proposed an energy policy tied to fossil fuels, 
disproportionate building of centralized generation plants, too little energy 
efficiency, lowering environmental standards and increased global warming 
emissions, Davis enacted it. 
First, Davis has tied the state for the next decade or longer to contracts 
with facilities that are exclusively fossil fuel generation. Second, he has 
encouraged an unprecedented surge in the building of new centralized fossil 
fuel plants. Finally, he has pushed the lowering of environmental standards 
to increase production from the dirtiest fossil fuel facilities. 
The state's new energy purchasing department has spent zero on renewable 
generation. David Freeman, the governor's energy czar, giving lip service to 
alternatives, has negotiated close to $50 billion in long-term contracts with 
fossil fuel generators. 
By comparison, the governor has authorized investment of only $13 million in 
expanding solar generation. Photovoltaic cells produce electricity directly 
from the sun's energy, offering a clean, efficient solution to the state's 
future peak energy demand. While the governor talks a lot about energy 
efficiency, the state's funding of demand programs is about 1 percent of the 
funding for supply. Most egregious, the vast majority of state energy 
efficiency money is funneled back to the utilities. 
While environmentalists deride the Bush administration proposals, in 
California organizations such as the Natural Resources Defense Council 
actively support Davis' fossil fuel energy policy. 
The Davis energy policy has stuck California with the same old electric 
system for at least the next decade. Money has literally been burned instead 
of invested in innovation and creation of a cleaner and more efficient 
system. The best hedge against price spikes is a diversity of fuel sources, 
unfortunately California's electric system is now tied to an even greater 
degree to fossil fuels. 
After binding the state economy to the past, the Davis end game is logical. 
Davis and his energy advisers want to spend tens of billions of dollars for 
the utilities' restoration -- the very companies that for so long stifled 
industry innovation and remain most responsible for California's energy 
fiasco. 
There is still an opportunity to make the best out of a bad situation. 
Instead of bailing out the utilities, they should be dismantled and sold off. 
A combination of a dozen or so local government and publicly owned companies 
should be created with a goal of innovating the industry. An auction could be 
held that would sell customer blocks and with it the state's long-term 
contracts. Choice should be reinstated with the lifting of the suspension on 
direct access to alternative suppliers. 
Instead of moving the state to the next level of energy development, the 
education governor's remedial energy teachings will force California to 
repeat its energy lessons.

Economics fuels power solution in California Price relief gains political 
support

Political pressure coming from the U.S. Congress and politicians from Western 
states seems to have influenced the approach to the power crisis, despite 
opposition to price caps in the Bush administration. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in June expanded price mitigation 
measures on wholesale electricity sales in California during periods when 
blackouts are possible. 
The measures encourage generators to sell power into the state to prevent 
emergency alerts from being declared, which trigger price caps. The move came 
with support growing in Congress, especially among representatives of Western 
states on both sides of the aisle, for legislation that would have capped 
wholesale prices in the region. 
The macroeconomic force may have been the difference between the $7 billion 
cost of power for California in 1999 and its rise to approximately $27 
billion in 2000. The cost is estimated to reach between $50 billion and $70 
billion in 2001. 
With that kind of money at stake, suddenly the concern becomes less a 
question of who is responsible for the problem, but rather, how it can be 
solved quickly to prevent harsh political consequences. 
California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer has conducted an investigation into the 
actions of power generators and offered multimillion dollar rewards to 
whistleblowers to provide evidence of price manipulation by independent power 
generators. The state is seeking refunds of $8.9 billion, the amount it 
estimates independent power generators overcharged California 's troubled 
utilities. 
The U.S. General Accounting Office has released a report criticizing the FERC 
for not finding evidence of power generators using plant outages to drive up 
prices in California . 
""FERC's [February] study was not thorough enough to support its overall 
conclusion that audited companies were not physically withholding electricity 
supply to influence prices,"" the GAO found. 
Of the major independent power generators and marketers, like Reliant Energy, 
Dynegy, Duke Energy and Enron, only Williams and its CEO Keith Bailey came 
out in April in favor of some sort of short- term price relief for California 
. 
""The political dynamic out there is much more Draconian than what we're 
proposing,"" Bailey told analysts in April, defending Williams' position 
supporting some limited, short-term price mitigation. 
What he was worried about was California Gov. Gray Davis using eminent domain 
powers to take over power plants and the state setting up a public power 
authority to build state-owned plants. 









Financial 
California Changes Stance on Refunds; Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks

California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to 
recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity , saying 
they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 
billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. 
Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is 
seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term 
contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for 
Davis. 
""We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get 
us $8.9 billion,"" Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. 
""You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you 
want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion."" 
The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a 
California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close 
to the negotiations. 
Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the 
amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach 
a compromise. 
""What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood,"" Wagner told 
reporters. ""In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I 
may offer a preliminary assessment."" The settlement conference is set to 
conclude on Monday. 
Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides 
toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. 
Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility, 
drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at 
sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. 
Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn, 
chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid 
manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in 
refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said. 
Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for 
all sides, is closed to the public and media. 
Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and 
his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a ""joke"" that the 
parties might as well wear ""clown suits,"" according to a Dow Jones report 
confirmed by sources close to the talks. 
But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant 
Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for 
failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers 
have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off 
various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said. 
Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's 
commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but 
now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's 
electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher 
refund figure, some energy analysts believe. 
Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an 
overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have 
to pay for energy under those deals. 
California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed 
deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at 
volatile ""spot market"" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so 
did the state's electricity bills. 
In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating 
long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so 
far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power 
for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. 
That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was 
paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and 
considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy 
analysts say. 
A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political 
pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's 
controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that 
reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count 
as a ""refund"" because the deals were reached ""under commercial duress,"" 
according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. 
Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. 
""There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be,"" said 
Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. 
The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a ""just and reasonable"" 
standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the 
overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. 
""It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate,"" 
said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight 
committee for the California grid. 
Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room 
""billions of dollars apart,"" as the talks approached their final weekend, 
sources said.

U.S. Hearing Officer May Impose Pact
To End California Power-Overcharge Case

WASHINGTON -- With settlement talks apparently stalled, a federal hearing 
officer said he may propose his own solution to settle billions in alleged 
electricity overcharges tied to the California power crisis. 
Curtis L. Wagner Jr. said he was still ""optimistic"" California officials and 
several power companies could come to terms on $8.9 billion in disputed 
electricity charges the state has incurred over the past year. 
Absent more-meaningful progress, he said he would offer his own ""preliminary 
assessment"" and recommendation as soon as today. 
In that event, Mr. Wagner also said, he would convene a hearing Monday where 
the two sides would be given the chance to comment on his plans. Mr. Wagner 
has previously indicated he feels California is due some refunds, but far 
less than the total the state claims. California is also indebted to the 
power companies for billions in previous deliveries; those debts could at 
least partially offset any refunds. Mr. Wagner has also said long-term 
contracts that would insulate the state from the sort of price shocks it has 
experienced over the past year could be part of any resolution. 
An administrative-law judge with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 
Mr. Wagner was named by the panel two weeks ago to broker a peace of the 
overcharge dispute. 
Commission officials have given the parties until Monday to reach an 
agreement behind closed doors. After that, absent a settlement, the 
commission has ordered Mr. Wagner to report back with his findings and 
recommendations within a week. 
At that point, the commission has said it will impose a settlement of its own 
liking. 
The overcharge issue has been a flash point in the California debacle, with 
the state's governor, Gray Davis, calling the energy companies ""pirates"" and 
""marauders."" 
The industry considers itself a scapegoat for a bungled state deregulation 
effort.

By Kevin Yamamura Bee Capitol Bureau (Published July 6, 2001) Two more former workers from a Duke Energy power plant came forward Thursday to bolster recent claims by colleagues that the power generator withheld production to drive up prices. But Duke attributed witness accounts of fluctuating generation to instructions from the state's transmission-grid operator. Richard J. Connors, an auxiliary operator, and E. Robert Edwards, an electrician, said generation units at Duke's Chula Vista plant sat idle during emergency periods for no apparent reason. Three of their former co-workers -- two mechanics and a control room operator -- told lawmakers two weeks ago that Duke had disposed of new parts and varied its production. While that testimony drew significant attention, it was countered Monday by a report released by the state's Independent System Operator that showed the ISO had in fact ordered Duke's up-and-down output Jan. 16-18. On Thursday, the Charlotte, N.C.-based company leaned on the ISO report in its defense. ""The ISO could have dispatched those units at will,"" said Duke spokesman Tom Williams, referring to unused equipment. But Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, who has filed a lawsuit against generators, contended that the ISO had based its orders on Duke's dubious bidding history. ""These ISO orders came only after Duke had continuously manipulated the market with price-gouging schemes forcing the ISO to regulate production,"" Bustamante said. Connors and Edwards each worked more than 20 years at the South Bay plant in Chula Vista. For most of that time, the plant was owned by San Diego Gas & Electric. Two years ago, Duke purchased South Bay and retained Connors and Edwards under state-mandated agreements that ended in April. Edwards said that during power blackouts in January, he saw a 225-megawatt unit off-line. Other units, he said, were operating far below capacity. ""Our No. 1 priority in life was to make money,"" Edwards said. Williams rebutted the claims as observations from those ""who did not have the complete picture."" ""It's dead on, dead true that there are times when that plant is not running at full capacity and there is a Stage 3,"" Williams said. ""There may be blackouts in San Francisco. But the reason why it's not running is because the power can't move up Path 15 (a north-south bottleneck)."" Bustamante, however, maintained that Duke has continued to manipulate the market, calling Connors and Edwards the ""tip of the iceberg"" in the price-gouging investigation. State Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, chairman of the Senate committee investigating price manipulation, said Connors and Edwards may testify before lawmakers after further evaluation. Dunn added that his committee has talked to potential whistleblowers from other power generators who said they have seen production decreases and suspicious activities. It is undetermined whether they will testify, he said. The Bee's Kevin Yamamura can be reached at (916) 326-5542 or kyamamura@sacbee.com. Lockyer seeks SEC investigation of PG&E's financial transfers By Ed Fletcher Bee Capitol Bureau (Published July 6, 2001) State Attorney General Bill Lockyer on Thursday asked the federal Securities and Exchange Commission to scrutinize financial transfers made to PG&E Corp. from its subsidiary that has filed for bankruptcy protection. ""SEC scrutiny is essential to protect the public interest, ratepayers and the people of the state of California,"" Lockyer said in a prepared statement. Charges that PG&E Corp. hastened the bankruptcy filing of Pacific Gas and Electric Co. have been made before, responded Greg Pruett, a vice president of PG&E Corp. ""That is an issue that has been investigated multiple times by the Public Utilities Commission earlier this year, by an Assembly oversight committee, and in each of these audits there has been no conclusion that the transfers were inappropriate or that they were injurious to PG&E Co.,"" Pruett said. In its filing with the SEC, the attorney general's office said that ""without meaningful review by the SEC, it cannot be determined what impact the transfer of assets ... may have on the financial condition of the bankrupt utility."" An SEC spokesman said the commission has yet to examine the petition. Among other concerns raised by Lockyer's office is the transfer of more than $4 billion from 1997 to 1999 to PG&E Corp. from PG&E Co. The majority of the $4 billion came from the sales of PG&E power plants, as was required by deregulation. ""The bulk of the money went to pay debt that was incurred to actually build those plants,"" Pruett said. The rest of the transfers were to pay stockholder dividends, he said. PG&E filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April after having run up $6.6 billion in debt. The Bee's Ed Fletcher can be reached at (916) 326-5548 or efletcher@sacbee.com. Business; Financial Desk California State Seeks SEC Probe of PG&E Transfers NANCY RIVERA BROOKS ? 07/06/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page C-2 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer on Thursday asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate PG&E Corp. for potential abuses of its responsibilities as a utility holding company. At issue is a series of transactions over the last several years in which PG&E Corp. transferred funds from its utility, Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which now is operating under Bankruptcy Court protection. The money--more than $4 billion since 1997--flowed to the parent company and to unregulated sister companies of the utilities. The transfers have been scrutinized by the California Public Utilities Commission and the state Legislature with no finding of wrongdoing, said PG&E Corp. spokesman Greg S. Pruett. The SEC currently exempts PG&E from almost all requirements of the Public Utility Holding Company Act because the San Francisco utility operates primarily within California . That law regulates transactions between holding companies and their utility subsidiaries. Lockyer wants the SEC to withdraw PG&E's exemption, citing $13 billion in PG&E assets outside of California . ""All the primary evils addressed by PUHCA are relevant to PG&E Corp.,"" Lockyer's petition to the SEC stated. In Bankruptcy Court on Thursday, PG&E said it is close to reaching an agreement with Calpine Corp. to pay more than $267 million it owes the San Jose-based power generator and to preserve contracts for 453 megawatts of relatively cheap electricity . In all, PG&E buys about 2,600 megawatts of electricity from nearly 25 alternative generators, which are seeking repayment and release from their contracts through Bankruptcy Court. National Desk THE NATION Little Progress on Energy Rebate, Judge Hints RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR ? 07/06/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page A-30 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company WASHINGTON -- The federal mediator seeking a settlement for billions of dollars in alleged electricity overcharges in California signaled Thursday that the talks are in trouble, and analysts said hope for a deal seems to be fading. Curtis L. Wagner Jr., chief judge of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said he may issue a report on the closed-door talks as early as today if he sees no progress. ""The judge will perhaps issue a preliminary assessment of the talks,"" said Tamara Young-Allen, a spokeswoman for FERC. ""He will do this only if he feels the talks aren't moving along as he sees fit."" Originally, a preliminary report from the judge was not part of the plan. Wagner had previously said all sides would labor in private through the weekend to try to get a deal by Monday's midnight deadline. If that failed, the judge said he would take seven days to craft a proposed settlement for FERC's governing board. Kit Konolige, a power industry analyst with Morgan Stanley in New York, said Wagner's announcement on Thursday amounted to a judicial distress signal. ""The judge wouldn't say something like this if the parties were close to a settlement,"" said Konolige. ""I suppose he may be trying to jump-start things, but I think most people believed the sides were so far apart going into the talks that it seemed like a long way to go to reach a settlement."" Although Wagner has imposed a gag order on participants, several people with knowledge of the negotiations said Thursday that major power generators and California officials have not budged from dug-in positions since the talks began last week. They also said the judge is extremely frustrated with the state and with several large power suppliers. California is demanding $9 billion in refunds. According to sources, the generators have offered less than $1 billion. And some major power sellers are insisting they do not owe anything. Many experts say California has little hope of obtaining the $9 billion since only $5.4 billion of that is attributable to sellers under FERC's jurisdiction. On the other hand, it seems clear from statements by FERC commissioners that the board is prepared to extract significant refunds from generators. Wagner is said to be probing for a compromise figure between $1 billion and $9 billion. It could take the form of a mix of cash payments and discounts on long-term contracts for power. FERC's governing board ordered Wagner to hold the talks to see if a compromise could be struck on three big issues: refunds, guarantees that generators will be paid, and ways to shift more of the state's power purchases to long-term contracts. The board also made clear that it would impose its own settlement if the state and power sellers were unable to come to an agreement. Wagner said Thursday that if he issues a preliminary report today, he will give all the parties a chance to respond publicly on Monday. Such a report might embarrass some of the key players, since Wagner is known for his plain-spoken conclusions. The judge would then prepare a settlement recommendation for the FERC board by July 16. However, he also said he is willing to work through the weekend to reach a settlement if it appears within striking distance. The talks are in a large hearing room on the second floor of the FERC building near Washington's Union Station. Access is strictly controlled and special badges have been issued to the more than 140 lawyers participating. Some people with knowledge of the negotiations said Wagner's threat to issue a report may be a bid to see if one of the parties will make a move. ""It was like a shot across the bow,"" said one source. * RELATED STORIES Energy savers: College students help businesses cut waste. B1 SEC probe: The state urges a review of PG&E fund transfers.

Gray Davis, even though one of the consultants dropped his Southern California Edison contract amid conflict-of- interest allegations. Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane were collectively known as the ""Masters of Disaster"" for their work in the Clinton White House during various federal investigations. They also worked for Vice President Al Gore during the 2000 presidential campaign. Because of their work for Davis, Connell says the contract Fabiani and Lehane signed with Edison is a conflict of interest under state ethics rules. Davis is negotiating with Edison on a bailout for the utility. Late last week, at the bottom of a press release, Davis announced that Fabiani was no longer a communications consultant because his work had been ""successfully implemented."" Lehane, on the other hand, has dropped his contract with Edison and signed a new agreement with Davis. Lehane's new contract includes reimbursement for travel and meal expenses, which he didn't have before, and requires him to work a maximum of 66 hours a month at $150 an hour. His total payments are capped at $76,000 for work from June 26 to Nov. 20, 2001. In his release, Davis said Lehane would be paid the same amount as former communications director Phil Trounstine, about $9,900 a month. But Connell, like Davis a Democrat, said Trounstine undoubtedly worked more than 66 hours in a month for his $9,990. ""We don't intend to be paying it,"" Connell said of the contract for both men. ""They represented Southern California Edison. You have to have a singular relationship with the state of California and not show a conflict."" Previously, the Davis administration said there was no conflict because Edison and Davis wanted the same things out of their negotiations. Earlier this week, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said attorneys had different opinions over whether the two consultants had violated ethics rules. Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said the governor had signed an executive order allowing him to enter into consulting contracts with anyone he believed could help him solve the state's energy crisis. She said Lehane had been working full-time on public policy, even though his contract caps his salary. The National Tax-Limitation Committee, a Sacramento group that mostly monitors legislation, sued last month alleging that Fabiani and Lehane were violating the state Political Reform Act because of the Edison contract. In a recently filed disclosure statement, Fabiani also listed more than $10, 000 worth of consulting work for Cisco Systems, another company that frequently brings issues before state authorities, including Davis. The state Fair Political Practices Commission also is looking into a complaint filed by GOP Secretary of State Bill Jones that Fabiani and Lehane violated state ethics rules.

Page?A - 3 Ex-staff speaks out against Duke Two more charge prices manipulated Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Friday, July 6, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/07/06/M N122949.DTL Sacramento -- Two more former employees at Duke Energy's Chula Vista power plant came forward yesterday with allegations that the company manipulated the energy market to drive up prices, although they offered no hard proof and little new information. Their accusations bring to five the number of Duke plant workers who say they observed suspicious behavior, including the disappearance of parts needed for repairs, the idling of generators for no apparent reason, and continual stopping and starting that critics of Duke suspect was designed to withhold power and artificially increase prices. E. Robert Edwards, a 50-year-old electrician, related one conversation with a Duke foreman sometime in January that prompted suspicion. ""I asked the foreman why Unit 4 wasn't running,"" Edwards said yesterday at a press conference. ""We had a 225-megawatt generator sitting there, and he just shrugged his shoulders and said, 'I really can't tell you. I'm not privy to that information.' "" State lawmakers have been focusing on whether Duke manipulated prices during three days in January, when the company at one point offered a single megawatt of power for a record-shattering $3,880. Duke says it was following orders from the Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power grid, when it repeatedly turned its generators on and off during those three days. An ISO memo recently released by Duke confirms the company's contention it was under orders. But January logs from the ISO and the generators don't offer an explanation for every allegation of price manipulation, since Duke has refused to release a detailed list of the prices it offered and paid during that period. The two workers who came forward yesterday, Edwards and 46-year-old Richard J. Connors, both worked more than 20 years in the business. They left the South Bay Plant in Chula Vista in April, two years after Duke purchased it from San Diego Gas & Electric as part of deregulation. SOME SHIFTS UNPOPULAR ""It is true units were taken offline, mostly on the weekends for whatever reason,"" said Connors, a former auxiliary operator. ""It got to the point as an operator that you were dreading working swing shifts on Sunday or graveyard Monday morning because you knew you were going to be running around putting units back online."" Edwards said he had seen a company warehouse eventually emptied of parts that are used to repair broken generators, although he didn't know where the parts went. Forcing a longer wait for repair parts was designed to dry up the power supply and push prices higher, lawmakers and other investigators suspect. Edwards, however, admitted the warehouse was being cleaned out even when SDG&E ran the plant. Duke contends the workers weren't familiar with Duke's inventory system and couldn't possibly know why parts were being moved. Duke and other energy companies are facing scrutiny by two legislative committees, a 19-member Sacramento County grand jury, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer, the California Public Utilities Commission and federal regulators. BUSTAMANTE ALSO SUING Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, who introduced Edwards and Connors yesterday, also is suing a variety of generators in state court for alleged price manipulation and bad business practices. He said Edwards and Connors ""reiterated what we've know all along -- Duke has been gouging California consumers through its use and abuse of the South Bay Plant."" Duke offers a variety of defenses for its actions during the three days in January and throughout the energy crisis. Tom Williams, a spokesman for Duke, said Edwards and Connors had offered nothing new yesterday. Beyond the ISO's 37 separate orders to stop and start generators during the three days in January, Williams said state air regulations required the company to shut the plant at certain times because it was running out of emissions credits that limit the amount of air pollution it can put out. Duke, which controls about 5 percent of the state energy market, also contends the state's power transmission lines can't always handle an increase in load. ""Yes, it's true there are times when that plant is not running at full capacity, and there is a Stage Three (alert), and there may be blackouts in San Francisco,"" Williams said. ""The reason why it's not running is the power cannot move up Path 15,"" the transmission line bottleneck near Los Banos.

Johnson, Chronicle Staff Writer Friday, July 6, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/07/06/M N138966.DTL Vallejo leaders, looking to escape mounting gas and electric bills, are planning to build enough new power generators that the city government will be self-sufficient when it comes to energy. City officials said they believe that Vallejo is the first city in the nation to take such an approach. ""This is going to be a showplace,"" said Scott Sossen, the chief executive officer of Edge Capital Group, a funding agency based in Orange County. Edge will be supervising the work along with O'Hara Energy Corp. of Nevada. The plan comes at a time when the city expects to see its energy costs double next year if it continues buying its power from PG&E. ""It couldn't be more timely,"" said Mayor Tony Intintoli. Vallejo leaders are in the process of contracting with private business to build new wind, solar and microturbine generators. Construction of a one- megawatt solar generator could start within 30 to 60 days. Conservation is also part of the plan, and energy-efficiency improvements are already under way at Vallejo City Hall and the fire and police stations. City officials hope to add enough sources of power generation to make all city offices -- which consume about 10 megawatts a year -- self-sufficient by the end of the year. The Vallejo City Council gave tentative approval to the project late last month and will continue its discussions on the plan next week. Vallejo taxpayers won't have to pay any money in advance, because Edge will finance the project's first $50 million in capital costs. In return, a portion of the city's projected financial savings will be shared with the Edge and O'Hara. ""This is a fairly sizable project,"" said Kevin Chambers, the chief executive officer at O'Hara. ""Energy-efficient capital is difficult to find because it is such a new field."" O'Hara is installing high-tech energy management systems at all city-owned property to reduce energy consumption. Final sites for the construction of new wind, solar and microturbine generators have not been chosen. In recent years, the energy bill for Vallejo city government has averaged between $2 million and $3 million per year. That includes the police and fire departments, City Hall and water-pumping stations. Vallejo is part of a group of 50 local governments in Northern California that pooled their resources to buy electricity and natural gas, keeping prices down. But the group's current contract expires Dec. 30. As a result, the city expects its energy bill to double next year, from 9.2 cents per kilowatt hour to 20 cents per kilowatt hour. ""It's been very positive what we've been doing, and it hasn't cost us anything,"" said City Manager David Martinez. ""We're going to be very optimistic that this is going to be a good thing for the city."" City officials hope to eventually extend the plan to Vallejo's 4,500 businesses and 37,000 households.

Page?A - 23 SEC asked to see if PG&E Corp. violated law with subsidiary Published Friday, July 6, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News BY JENNIFER BJORHUS Mercury News California Attorney General Bill Lockyer asked the federal Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday to step in to investigate whether PG&E Corp. violated federal law in taking billions of dollars from its bankrupt subsidiary. ``SEC scrutiny is essential to protect the public interest, ratepayers and the people of the state of California,'' Lockyer said in a statement. More than $4 billion flowed from the Pacific Gas & Electric utility to parent PG&E Corp. from 1997 to 1999, according to Lockyer's petition, representing nearly 70 percent of the cash that flowed to the parent company during that period. PG&E Corp. spent $2.7 billion to buy back its stock, $1.5 billion to pay dividends to shareholders and invested $800 million in its other subsidiaries, according to the petition filed Thursday in Washington. Those figures are similar to figures from a state-ordered independent audit of PG&E Corp.'s finances released in late January. By moving assets from the utility to other businesses, the company potentially harmed the utility and violated the federal Public Utility Holding Company Act in several ways, according to the petition. The SEC is the nation's top cop for publicly held companies. But the commission has not reviewed PG&E Corp.'s asset movements, saying the company is exempt from scrutiny under the Public Utility Holding Company Act because it's mainly a California operation and such intrastate operations are exempt. The attorney general's office argues that PG&E Corp., with more than $13 billion of its assets outside the state, can no longer claim it is primarily an intrastate company. The SEC should step in, it argues. The petition surprised PG&E Corp. officials, who said they had no idea the attorney general's office had an issue with the company's exemption from the federal law, said company spokesman Greg Pruett. Pruett said PG&E Corp.'s actions were appropriate because the federal utility law only applies if a company has one or more of the following activities in several states: electric transmission and distribution, gas distribution or utility-owned generation. ``We have none of those things except in California,'' Pruett said, adding that the National Energy Group, a PG&E Corp. affiliate, ``has natural gas transmission but no distribution.'' ``The power plants that NEG owns or operates are not part of a utility and thus aren't regulated by PUCHA, and it has an energy-trading arm that is also not regulated by PUCHA,'' he said. The petition further asks the SEC to order PG&E Corp. to cooperate fully with the California Public Utilities Commission. The state commission is investigating whether PG&E Corp.'s corporate structure and its relationship with its bankrupt utility violate state utility regulations. The petition states it expects a response from the SEC within 60 days. But SEC spokesman John Heine said there's no statutory deadline for a response. He said he had not seen the petition and could not comment. Contact Jennifer Bjorhus at jbjorhus@sjmercury.com or (408) 920-5660. Judge may speed up electricity refund talks Published Friday, July 6, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News BY RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR Los Angeles Times WASHINGTON -- A federal mediator seeking a settlement for billions of dollars in alleged electricity overcharges in California signaled Thursday that the talks are in trouble. Curtis L. Wagner Jr., chief judge of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said he may issue a report on the closed-door talks as early as today if progress is not made. ``The judge will perhaps issue a preliminary assessment of the talks,'' said Tamara Young-Allen, a FERC spokeswoman. ``He will do this only if he feels the talks aren't moving along as he sees fit.'' Wagner had previously said all sides would labor in private through the weekend to try to get a deal by the deadline of Monday at midnight. If that failed, the judge said, he would take seven days to craft a proposed settlement for FERC's governing board. California is demanding $9 billion in refunds. According to sources, the generators have offered less than $1 billion. Wagner is said to be probing for a compromise figure that could take the form of a mix of cash payments and discounts on long-term contracts for power. Davis keeps state addicted to fossil fuels Published Friday, July 6, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News BY JOE COSTELLO BEFORE this year's energy ``crisis,'' Gray Davis wanted to be known as the education governor. However, Davis and his advisers' energy teachings have revealed alarming failures, setting back state energy policy not one or two years, but one or two decades. While George W. Bush proposed an energy policy tied to fossil fuels, disproportionate building of centralized generation plants, too little energy efficiency, lowering environmental standards and increased global warming emissions, Davis enacted it. First, Davis has tied the state for the next decade or longer to contracts with facilities that are exclusively fossil fuel generation. Second, he has encouraged an unprecedented surge in the building of new centralized fossil fuel plants. Finally, he has pushed the lowering of environmental standards to increase production from the dirtiest fossil fuel facilities. The state's new energy purchasing department has spent zero on renewable generation. David Freeman, the governor's energy czar, giving lip service to alternatives, has negotiated close to $50 billion in long-term contracts with fossil fuel generators. By comparison, the governor has authorized investment of only $13 million in expanding solar generation. Photovoltaic cells produce electricity directly from the sun's energy, offering a clean, efficient solution to the state's future peak energy demand. While the governor talks a lot about energy efficiency, the state's funding of demand programs is about 1 percent of the funding for supply. Most egregious, the vast majority of state energy efficiency money is funneled back to the utilities. While environmentalists deride the Bush administration proposals, in California organizations such as the Natural Resources Defense Council actively support Davis' fossil fuel energy policy. The Davis energy policy has stuck California with the same old electric system for at least the next decade. Money has literally been burned instead of invested in innovation and creation of a cleaner and more efficient system. The best hedge against price spikes is a diversity of fuel sources, unfortunately California's electric system is now tied to an even greater degree to fossil fuels. After binding the state economy to the past, the Davis end game is logical. Davis and his energy advisers want to spend tens of billions of dollars for the utilities' restoration -- the very companies that for so long stifled industry innovation and remain most responsible for California's energy fiasco. There is still an opportunity to make the best out of a bad situation. Instead of bailing out the utilities, they should be dismantled and sold off. A combination of a dozen or so local government and publicly owned companies should be created with a goal of innovating the industry. An auction could be held that would sell customer blocks and with it the state's long-term contracts. Choice should be reinstated with the lifting of the suspension on direct access to alternative suppliers. Instead of moving the state to the next level of energy development, the education governor's remedial energy teachings will force California to repeat its energy lessons.

Business Economics fuels power solution in California Price relief gains political support Robert Gibbons, BridgeNews ? 07/06/2001 Chicago Tribune North Sports Final ; N Page 3 (Copyright 2001 by the Chicago Tribune) Political pressure coming from the U.S. Congress and politicians from Western states seems to have influenced the approach to the power crisis, despite opposition to price caps in the Bush administration. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in June expanded price mitigation measures on wholesale electricity sales in California during periods when blackouts are possible. The measures encourage generators to sell power into the state to prevent emergency alerts from being declared, which trigger price caps. The move came with support growing in Congress, especially among representatives of Western states on both sides of the aisle, for legislation that would have capped wholesale prices in the region. The macroeconomic force may have been the difference between the $7 billion cost of power for California in 1999 and its rise to approximately $27 billion in 2000. The cost is estimated to reach between $50 billion and $70 billion in 2001. With that kind of money at stake, suddenly the concern becomes less a question of who is responsible for the problem, but rather, how it can be solved quickly to prevent harsh political consequences. California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer has conducted an investigation into the actions of power generators and offered multimillion dollar rewards to whistleblowers to provide evidence of price manipulation by independent power generators. The state is seeking refunds of $8.9 billion, the amount it estimates independent power generators overcharged California 's troubled utilities. The U.S. General Accounting Office has released a report criticizing the FERC for not finding evidence of power generators using plant outages to drive up prices in California . ""FERC's [February] study was not thorough enough to support its overall conclusion that audited companies were not physically withholding electricity supply to influence prices,"" the GAO found. Of the major independent power generators and marketers, like Reliant Energy, Dynegy, Duke Energy and Enron, only Williams and its CEO Keith Bailey came out in April in favor of some sort of short- term price relief for California . ""The political dynamic out there is much more Draconian than what we're proposing,"" Bailey told analysts in April, defending Williams' position supporting some limited, short-term price mitigation. What he was worried about was California Gov. Gray Davis using eminent domain powers to take over power plants and the state setting up a public power authority to build state-owned plants. Financial California Changes Stance on Refunds; Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks Peter Behr ? 07/06/2001 The Washington Post FINAL Page E01 Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity , saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis. ""We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get us $8.9 billion,"" Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. ""You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion."" The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close to the negotiations. Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise. ""What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood,"" Wagner told reporters. ""In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment."" The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday. Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility, drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn, chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said. Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides, is closed to the public and media. Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a ""joke"" that the parties might as well wear ""clown suits,"" according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks. But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said. Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure, some energy analysts believe. Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals. California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile ""spot market"" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so did the state's electricity bills. In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy analysts say. A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a ""refund"" because the deals were reached ""under commercial duress,"" according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. ""There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be,"" said Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a ""just and reasonable"" standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. ""It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate,"" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid. Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room ""billions of dollars apart,"" as the talks approached their final weekend, sources said. http://www.washingtonpost.com Contact: http://www.washingtonpost.com Politics & Policy U.S. Hearing Officer May Impose Pact To End California Power-Overcharge Case By Richard B. Schmitt ? 07/06/2001 The Wall Street Journal Page A10 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) WASHINGTON -- With settlement talks apparently stalled, a federal hearing officer said he may propose his own solution to settle billions in alleged electricity overcharges tied to the California power crisis. Curtis L. Wagner Jr. said he was still ""optimistic"" California officials and several power companies could come to terms on $8.9 billion in disputed electricity charges the state has incurred over the past year. Absent more-meaningful progress, he said he would offer his own ""preliminary assessment"" and recommendation as soon as today. In that event, Mr. Wagner also said, he would convene a hearing Monday where the two sides would be given the chance to comment on his plans. Mr. Wagner has previously indicated he feels California is due some refunds, but far less than the total the state claims. California is also indebted to the power companies for billions in previous deliveries; those debts could at least partially offset any refunds. Mr. Wagner has also said long-term contracts that would insulate the state from the sort of price shocks it has experienced over the past year could be part of any resolution. An administrative-law judge with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Mr. Wagner was named by the panel two weeks ago to broker a peace of the overcharge dispute. Commission officials have given the parties until Monday to reach an agreement behind closed doors. After that, absent a settlement, the commission has ordered Mr. Wagner to report back with his findings and recommendations within a week. At that point, the commission has said it will impose a settlement of its own liking. The overcharge issue has been a flash point in the California debacle, with the state's governor, Gray Davis, calling the energy companies ""pirates"" and ""marauders."" The industry considers itself a scapegoat for a bungled state deregulation effort.",1,"Company Business, Strategy, etc."

Below is the text of recommendations taken from the summary of 
recommendations in the Cheney Energy Report being released later this morning 
that focus on coal and coal-related issues, including environmental.

""The NEPD Group (National Energy Policy Development) recommends that the 
President direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) to propose multi-pollutant legislation.  The NEPD Group recommends that 
the President  direct the EPA Administrator to work with Congress to propose 
legislation that would establish a flexible, market-based program to 
significantly reduce and cap emissions fo sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, 
and mercury from electric power generators.  Such a program (with appropriate 
measures to address local concerns) would provide significant public health 
benefits even as we increase electricity supplies.

 Establish mandatory reduction targets to emissions of three main pollutants: 
sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury.

 Phase in reductions over a reasonable period of time, similar to the 
successful acid rain reduction program established by the 1990 amendments to
 the Clean Air Act.

 Provide regulatory certainty to allow utilities to make modifications to 
their plants without fear of new litigation.

 Provide market-based incentives, such as emissions trading credits to help 
achieve the required reductions.""

""The NEPD Group recognizes the importance of looking to technology to help us 
meet the goals of increasing electricity generation while protecting our 
environment.  To that end, the NEPD Group  recommends that the President 
direct the Department of Energy to continue to develop advanced clean coal 
technology by:

 Investing $2 billion over 10 years to fund research in clean coal 
technologies.

 Supporting a permanent extension of the existing research and development 
tax credit.

 Directing federal agencies to explore regulatory approaches that will 
encourage advancements in environmental technology.

""The NEPD Group recomemnds that the President direct federal agencies to 
provide greater regulatory certainty relating to coal electricity generation 
through clear policies that are easily applied to business decisions.""

""The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the Administrator of the 
Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy 
and other relevant agencies, to review New Source Review regulations, 
including administrative interpretations and implementation, and report to 
the President within 90 days on the impact of the regulations on investment 
in new utility and refinery generation capacity, energy efficiency, and 
environmental protection.""

""The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the Attorney General to 
review existing enforcement actions regarding New Source Review to ensure 
that the enforcement actions are consistent with the Clean Air Act and its 
regulations.""

""The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct federal agencies to 
support continued research into global climate change; continue efforts to 
identify environmentally and cost-effective ways to use market mechanisms and 
incentives; continue development of new technologies; and cooperate with 
allies, including through international processes, to develop technologies, 
market-based incentives, and other innovative approaches to address the issue 
of global climate change.","Other Aspects of Cheney Energy Report Recommendations of Interest to Enron -- Coal and Enviro Related. Below is the text of recommendations taken from the summary of recommendations in the Cheney Energy Report being released later this morning that focus on coal and coal-related issues, including environmental. ""The NEPD Group (National Energy Policy Development) recommends that the President direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to propose multi-pollutant legislation. The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the EPA Administrator to work with Congress to propose legislation that would establish a flexible, market-based program to significantly reduce and cap emissions fo sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury from electric power generators. Such a program (with appropriate measures to address local concerns) would provide significant public health benefits even as we increase electricity supplies. Establish mandatory reduction targets to emissions of three main pollutants: sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury. Phase in reductions over a reasonable period of time, similar to the successful acid rain reduction program established by the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act. Provide regulatory certainty to allow utilities to make modifications to their plants without fear of new litigation. Provide market-based incentives, such as emissions trading credits to help achieve the required reductions."" ""The NEPD Group recognizes the importance of looking to technology to help us meet the goals of increasing electricity generation while protecting our environment. To that end, the NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the Department of Energy to continue to develop advanced clean coal technology by: Investing $2 billion over 10 years to fund research in clean coal technologies. Supporting a permanent extension of the existing research and development tax credit. Directing federal agencies to explore regulatory approaches that will encourage advancements in environmental technology. ""The NEPD Group recomemnds that the President direct federal agencies to provide greater regulatory certainty relating to coal electricity generation through clear policies that are easily applied to business decisions."" ""The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy and other relevant agencies, to review New Source Review regulations, including administrative interpretations and implementation, and report to the President within 90 days on the impact of the regulations on investment in new utility and refinery generation capacity, energy efficiency, and environmental protection."" ""The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the Attorney General to review existing enforcement actions regarding New Source Review to ensure that the enforcement actions are consistent with the Clean Air Act and its regulations."" ""The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct federal agencies to support continued research into global climate change; continue efforts to identify environmentally and cost-effective ways to use market mechanisms and incentives; continue development of new technologies; and cooperate with allies, including through international processes, to develop technologies, market-based incentives, and other innovative approaches to address the issue of global climate change.",1,"Company Business, Strategy, etc."

See NERC memo below that was just received.  They have scheduled what they hope will be the final meeting to ""resolve"" the reliability legislation next week -- August 9th.  Of course, this is awfully presumptuous in that it assumes that the model to be worked off of is the NERC model (even the shortened one), and not the PJM model that others prefer to use.  We need to decide whether we suggest any changes to the shortened NERC version, even those we know they would not take just to show a willingness to offer specific comments as we promised at the last meeting, or simply ""agree to disagree.""

Reliability legislation coalition

I have attached a memo outlining the edits that NERC would make in the
7/19 discussion draft.  My memo does not take account of the suggestions
that have been circulated in the last day or so.  I've also attached a
marked-up version of the 7/19 draft indicating our changes.

I propose that we meet in Washington on Thursday, August 9, at 10:00
a.m., with the goal of coming to closure on reliability legislation that
is shorter and less detailed than the language in the pending bills, but
that still preserves the essence of an industry self-regulatory
organization.  I am working on a location and expect to provide that
information tomorrow.

I know that scheduling this meeting may be difficult for some and that
schedules are already full, but schedules will become even more
difficult later in the month.  I take as our deadline having new
language for the Hill during the August recess.

Thank you in advance for your continuing efforts to bring this new model
for reliability into existence.

here is our analysis of load growth.  i have no idea where cera came up with 
there's.  in short, it looks like load grew somewhere between 5% and 6% per 
year between april 1998 and june of 2000.  since then, load growth has been 
flat to negative.  from april 1998 to february 2001 it looks like typical 
load growth was around 3.7% on an annualized basis.

My message was sent before I finished it.
I think it would be interesting to focus your attention on this interplay  
--  what policy changes have meant to companies (ie the winners and losers) 
and how explicit companies are about how government policy drives their 
business strategy in these industries.  I also think it would be fascinating 
to compare regulators' visions for the industry they are restructuring with 
the reality after the fact.  I believe you would find some similarities but 
also some substantial and interesting differences.
Good luck with your studies.
My best regards to Mike; I learned a great deal working for him.

Davis favors tiered rate increases

N30195.DTL 
Gov. Gray Davis, faced with the near inevitability of raising consumers' 
electricity bills, is leaning toward a rate system whereby those who use more 
power pay more than those who conserve, The Chronicle has learned. 
Sources close to the governor said he is being lobbied by his own staff 
members to accept a so-called structured rate system. 
Top officials from his own administration told lawmakers Friday that the 
state may end up spending more than twice the $10 billion previously 
estimated to purchase power on behalf of California's near-bankrupt 
utilities. 
If so, the officials warned that consumers' electricity rates could double. 
In the case of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., this would mean customers' 
average monthly power bills would rise from $60 to $120. 
Consumers throughout the Bay Area believe that at least some increase is on 
the way. 
""We're going to have to bite the bullet and pay the money,"" said Larry 
Webster, a retired Caltrans worker in Redwood City. ""We might as well admit 
that electricity is no longer a nickel. It's a dime. If you're going to use 
it, 
let's pay for it."" 
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, distanced himself yesterday 
from estimates that rates would double. The figures reported in the press, he 
said, ""were wildly high."" 
""The governor still believes he can live within the existing rate structure, 
"" Maviglio said. ""Until we know the results of the negotiations with the 
utilities, you can't conclude anything."" 
The state is negotiating a multibillion-dollar bailout package with PG&E and 
Southern California Edison Co. to relieve the utilities of about $13 billion 
in debt. 
PG&E and Edison have been saying for months that there is no way California 
can overcome its current energy woes without higher rates. The irony of the 
Davis administration now saying the same thing was not lost on the two 
companies. 
""The state is in the exact same position the utilities were in last fall,"" 
said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman. ""Either wholesale prices need to come 
down or retail prices need to go up. The disparity is too large."" 
Statewide blackouts last week drove home the precariousness of California's 
energy situation to ratepayers -- and may have served as a blessing in 
disguise for the governor. 
COST VS. OUTAGES
If given a choice between further outages and paying higher rates, many 
consumers said they would accept increases in their power bills. 
""I don't like either choice,"" said Janet Leroux, facing the possibility of a 
gooey mess if the air conditioning goes out at her downtown San Francisco 
candy store. ""But I guess I'd go with higher rates. I sure didn't like the 
blackouts."" 
Publicly, the governor has been insisting for weeks that rates will stay 
within ""the existing rate structure"" -- a stealthy way of saying that 
January's 9 percent increase and an expected 10 percent increase next year 
will remain in place. 
But privately, he and his staff are discussing additional rate increases that 
could be spread over as long as 10 years, sources said. 
Utility executives and power generators told The Chronicle last week that a 
minimum 30 percent rate increase lasting up to a decade is in the cards. 
""For the good of California, it's inevitable,"" said Gary Ackerman, executive 
director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a Menlo Park energy industry 
association. 
Sacramento resident John Hax observed that when temperatures soar in the 
Central Valley this summer, he'd be more than willing to pay a higher price 
for power if this keeps the air conditioners on. 
""It's like gasoline,"" he said. ""I don't like paying higher prices for 
gasoline, but that's the price of doing business."" 
Ratepayers draw the line, though, at any increase topping 10 or 20 percent. 
""If it was 20 percent, I'd probably do it,"" said Tracy resident Mark 
Dougherty. ""But if it was more, like 50 percent, I'd rather go with rolling 
blackouts."" 
""I'd rather have blackouts,"" agreed Jenny Soghomonian, owner of a shoe- 
repair shop in San Francisco's Financial District. ""I don't want to pay rates 
that are so much higher."" 
NOT EVERY COST PALATABLE
This is the tightrope that state officials and industry players now find 
themselves walking: While consumers may be willing to pay more to avoid 
blackouts, they aren't willing to swallow virtually any cost thrown their 
way. 
Yet if rates are not high enough, they may not prevent daily blackout threats 
this summer and beyond. 
""Higher rates are the price signal that it takes for conservation,"" said Tom 
Higgins, senior vice president of Edison International, parent company of 
Southern California Edison. 
Simply put, he meant that most consumers will not aggressively conserve 
power, and thus alleviate shortages, unless there is a financial incentive to 
do so. 
Rebates proposed by the governor have met with only a lukewarm response, 
requiring, critics say, too much effort on the part of individual ratepayers. 
But a sudden spike in monthly power bills almost certainly would prompt 
widespread conservation measures. 
""It adjusts consumer behavior,"" Higgins said. ""People want to get their bills 
back down."" 
RATES' EFFECT ON USAGE
He and other industry sources said higher rates are perhaps the only way 
Californians will achieve the 10 percent conservation goal sought by the 
governor -- a move seen as vital if blackouts are to be avoided this summer. 
""It's intellectually dishonest to think there's any other way out of this,"" 
Higgins said. 
Consumer activists' initial reaction to any talk of a rate increase comes 
across loud and clear: No, no, no. 
""No bailout. No rate increases. No secret deals,"" said Harvey Rosenfield, 
head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. ""We 
need to get back to a regulated system."" 
Rosenfield is the biggest fly in the governor's ointment. He has threatened 
to push through a ballot initiative re-regulating California's power market 
if Davis cannot find a consumer-friendly way out of the current fix. 
Because of Rosenfield's past success in writing a ballot measure on insurance 
rebates, which delivered about $800 million to consumers, his threat is taken 
seriously in Sacramento. 
""We've paid too much already,"" Rosenfield said. ""A fair price is what we were 
promised by deregulation, which was a 20 percent rate decrease."" 
However, when he was asked whether there was any room to discuss a structured 
rate increase such as the idea being promoted by the governor's staff, 
Rosenfield toned down his characteristic rhetoric. 
""Big users should pay more,"" he said after a moment's reflection. ""I'm open 
to a tiered system but only if it's fair."" 
Rosenfield quickly added that he would have to see how other consumer 
advocates felt about the matter before agreeing to negotiate such things with 
Davis. 
MOVE TOWARD STRUCTURED RATES
Clearly, though, momentum is building toward a system of structured power 
rates, which probably would include increases of varying sizes for consumers. 
The California Public Utilities Commission is scheduled to address January's 
9 percent rate increase on Tuesday. That increase originally was given only a 
three-month duration, but most observers expect it to be renewed for at least 
another three months, if not longer. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch declined to comment on the likelihood of rates 
going up but added her voice to those backing a structured system. 
""I am a fan of restructuring rates to exempt conservation,"" she said. ""People 
who use a whole lot of power should pay more."" 
The biggest electricity customer in the state is the state itself, now that 
California is purchasing power on behalf of its cash-poor utilities. The 
state already has spent about $4 billion buying electricity and has yet to 
determine how the cash will be recouped from consumers. 
San Francisco resident Rosita Magee accepts that for California to find its 
energy footing once more, rates will probably be heading up. ""That way, you 
have more convenience and electricity, more stability,"" she said. 
But Magee has come up with another solution, one that doesn't involve rate 
increases and rolling blackouts. 
She's moving to Texas.

Why is Davis being so belligerent? Because it's good politics. Ever since h=

Judge Bars Ratepayers Panel From PG&E Case
Power: Customers are not creditors in the utility's bankruptcy, ruling says=
.=20
Action does not preclude refunds for consumers.
TIM REITERMAN
TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 11 2001

SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge Tuesday reaffirmed his decision to bar a=
=20
ratepayers committee from Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s bankruptcy case and=
=20
denounced the committee's attorney for suggesting that the action could=20
prevent PG&E customers from receiving refunds for excessive energy charges.

Judge Dennis Montali ruled against a U.S. trustee and the ratepayers=20
committee in deciding that ratepayers as a group had no claims and were not=
=20
creditors when PG&E filed for bankruptcy on April 6.

But Montali criticized ""misguided remarks"" by a committee attorney on July =
5=20
and news media accounts that followed the hearing. The judge said the repor=
ts=20
left the misconception that by disallowing a ratepayers committee, he would=
=20
reject all claims of ratepayers and they could lose out on future refunds.

The judge and PG&E officials emphasized that there are no matters involving=
=20
PG&E customer refunds before the state Public Utilities Commission.

State officials are seeking about $9 billion in refunds, however, from the=
=20
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for alleged overcharges to Californian=
s=20
by energy companies since last year.

The distribution of any ratepayer refunds would be decided by the PUC, and=
=20
customers would be paid whether or not they filed Bankruptcy Court claims b=
y=20
a Sept. 5 deadline, the judge and PG&E attorneys said.

The judge took the highly unusual step of directing PG&E and U.S. Trustee=
=20
Linda Ekstrom Stanley to consider remedies to allay any confusion among=20
PG&E's 5.5 million customers.

He suggested publishing clarifications in newspapers that carried the=20
erroneous information, in PG&E customer bills and on Web sites.

Stanley had formed a ratepayers committee of business, government and=20
consumer representatives, saying they will be affected by PG&E's Chapter 11=
=20
reorganization.

But Montali decided that ratepayers do not qualify as creditors under=20
bankruptcy law and are not entitled to official status that allows them to=
=20
participate in the bankruptcy and receive funding from PG&E.

Stanley said she has not yet decided whether to appeal the ruling to federa=

to increase fuel efficiency requirements for sport utility vehicles as part=
=20
of an energy package.=20
Key House GOP lawmakers said Tuesday they expect some increase in fuel=20

At the same time, the Bush administration signaled its willingness Tuesday =

in the federal corporate automobile fuel economy, or CAFE, standard.=20
Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta asked Congress to lift immediately a=

=20
beyond September, but Mineta said he wants to start examining possible=20

CAFE standards, which mandate fuel economy requirements for vehicle fleets,=
=20
have not been increased since their introduction in 1975. That year's law,=
=20
spurred by energy shortages in the early 1970s, required passengers cars to=
=20
meet a fleet average of at least 27.5 miles per gallon. Light trucks -- a=
=20
category that includes SUVs, vans and pickups -- have to meet a 20.7 mpg=20
fleet average.=20
With the widespread popularity of SUVs and vans in recent years, many=20
environmentalists have argued that the lower truck standard has compromised=
=20
the intent of the 1975 law. SUVs and vans comprise more than 40 percent of=
=20
the passenger vehicles on the road today.=20
As three committees began crafting energy legislation, lawmakers were=20
searching for a bipartisan compromise to increase fuel economy requirements=

for motor vehicles. Some increase in the CAFE requirement was virtually=20

But Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., the committee chairman, said discussions were=

expects an amendment on CAFE to be added to the bill, either during=20

Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, chairman of the subcommittee drafting the energy=

Davis ups the voltage=20
Published Wednesday, July 11, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News=20
Vow to sue for refunds may be a bluff, but he should keep pushing FERC=20
THE strategic choice facing Gov. Gray Davis in the struggle over electricit=
y=20
price refunds has come down to three questions: When do you negotiate, when=
=20
do you demand, and when do you bluff?=20
Negotiations are over, Davis declared Tuesday. He demanded that the Federal=
=20
Energy Regulatory Commission order refunds now. ``The case is nearly a year=
=20
old,'' he said. ``They have to decide which side they're on.''=20
Probably no one but Davis knew to what extent he was bluffing when he also=
=20
said, ``If you think California is going to settle for $1 billion in refund=
s,=20
we will see you in court.''=20
A FERC administrative judge said Monday that the amount due the state may b=
e=20
around $1 billion, or perhaps nothing at all, when counter-claims against t=
he=20
state are subtracted.=20
Energy experts are divided about whether the state would win a suit to=20
overturn a decision by a federal commission. The federal courts have some=
=20
limited jurisdiction, according to University of California Energy Institut=
e=20
director Severin Borenstein, but that a court would reverse a commission in=
 a=20
case like this is ``extremely unlikely.''=20
Frank Wolak, a Stanford economist, had the opposite view, when asked whethe=
r=20
the state has a good chance of winning: ``I think so. It happens all the=20
time.''=20
At a Sacramento press conference, Davis continued to insist that there have=
=20
been overcharges of $8.9 billion. But other state officials conceded that=
=20
only $5.4 billion of that is actually on the table in the FERC proceedings.=
=20
Davis said he'll take what he can get there, and sue for the rest.=20
The state argues that because FERC has determined that wholesale prices hav=
e=20
not met the Federal Power Act's requirement to be ``just and reasonable,''=
=20
refunds are in order. But the commission has not defined what portion=20
exceeded ``just and reasonable.''=20
Throughout his press conference, Davis used the prospect of litigation like=
 a=20
goad to spur the federal regulators into action. But if you listened=20
carefully, he also indicated he'll give them more time to consider the case=
.=20
Considering the iffy odds of winning in court, we suggest he keep goading t=
he=20
federal commissioners -- while giving them all the time they need.









Wednesday, July 11, 2001=20






Lights go out on Davis' power show=20
Three new developments show that some economic reality finally is being=20
applied to California's electricity crisis:=20
First, ""The nation's chief energy judge said Monday that California is owed=
=20
maybe $1 billion in refunds from power generators, a fraction of the $8.9=
=20
billion demanded by Gov. Gray Davis,"" reported the Register yesterday. Even=
=20
that $1 billion amount might be balanced by the amount the state still owes=
=20
the power producers.=20




To suggest workable and market-oriented solutions to the California=20
electricity crisis.

Judge Curtis Wagner's recommendation will be taken up by the Federal Energy=
=20
Regulatory Commission, which is being petitioned for the money by the state=
=20
of California.=20
Because the judge's words will bolster FERC's apparent desire not to grant=
=20
the ""refunds,"" the state probably will go to court, where the matter could =
be=20
stuck for years.
""In the long term, this may indicate that competitive electricity has a=20
future even in California, but not thanks to the state,"" Robert Michaels, a=
=20
professor of economics at Cal State Fullerton, told us. He's referring to t=
he=20
state's botched 1996 ""deregulation"" effort, which has been made worse by Go=
v.=20
Gray Davis and other officials since the crisis began a year ago.
""FERC since the 1980s favors competition, within the parameters of politica=
l=20
reality,"" Mr. Michaels added. ""Now we're at square one: The industry doesn'=
t=20
owe $9 billion to California."" As this process continues, he said, another=
=20
positive aspect will be that a lot of facts will get aired. ""We'll see what=
=20
has been happening in the markets"" in which power is bought and sold.
Second, light already is shining on one area: This crisis was not ""Made in=
=20
Texas'' by cronies of President Bush, as Gov. Davis and other Democrats hav=
e=20
been contending.=20
In May, the governor attacked the president for ignoring ""the greed of thes=
e=20
Texas energy companies,"" such as Reliant and Dynergy.
In fact, according to information on state power contracts the governor=20
finally released Monday, Texas companies were way down on the list of=20
producers.=20
""In roughly the first five months of the year, the state shelled out $1.2=
=20
billion to Atlanta-based Mirant, the most any company was paid for=20
electricity, followed by $1 billion to Powerex, the marketing arm of BC Hyd=
ro=20
in British Columbia [in Canada]. It also paid $331 million to the Los Angel=
es=20
Department of Water and Power,"" reported the San Jose Mercury News.
Only about 10 percent of our state's power during this period came from=20
companies with headquarters in Texas.
Third, and finally, a new study by the Cato Institute shows what should be=
=20
done next:=20
lAbolish retail rate caps, allowing prices to be set by the market.=20
This would be a better system than the present one, where the state buys th=
e=20
electricity and passes much of the cost along through the state budget (pai=
d=20
by taxpayers) and bonds paid for by long-term electricity price increases.=
=20
Higher immediate prices would encourage conservation and production, leadin=
g=20
in time to lower prices.
lMove to real-time pricing so people shift activities such as washing to=20
off-peak hours.=20
lAbolish the Independent System Operator, which moves electrons around.=20

TIM REITERMAN TIMES STAFF WRITER July 11 2001 SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge Tuesday reaffirmed his decision to bar a= =20 ratepayers committee from Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s bankruptcy case and= =20 denounced the committee's attorney for suggesting that the action could=20 prevent PG&E customers from receiving refunds for excessive energy charges. Judge Dennis Montali ruled against a U.S. trustee and the ratepayers=20 committee in deciding that ratepayers as a group had no claims and were not= =20 creditors when PG&E filed for bankruptcy on April 6. But Montali criticized ""misguided remarks"" by a committee attorney on July = 5=20 and news media accounts that followed the hearing. The judge said the repor= ts=20 left the misconception that by disallowing a ratepayers committee, he would= =20 reject all claims of ratepayers and they could lose out on future refunds.

State officials are seeking about $9 billion in refunds, however, from the= =20 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for alleged overcharges to Californian= s=20 by energy companies since last year.

The judge took the highly unusual step of directing PG&E and U.S. Trustee= =20 Linda Ekstrom Stanley to consider remedies to allay any confusion among=20 PG&E's 5.5 million customers. He suggested publishing clarifications in newspapers that carried the=20 erroneous information, in PG&E customer bills and on Web sites. Stanley had formed a ratepayers committee of business, government and=20 consumer representatives, saying they will be affected by PG&E's Chapter 11= =20 reorganization. But Montali decided that ratepayers do not qualify as creditors under=20 bankruptcy law and are not entitled to official status that allows them to= =20 participate in the bankruptcy and receive funding from PG&E.

Looks good.  I think you implicitly say this, but I think you should make it 
more explicit:

The continued growth of the new economy is threatened by our electricity 
infrastructure more than anything else.
The high tech industry requires market driven solutions to reliability and 
pricing not the old style command and control regulated monopoly approach.
Let's start getting the word out!

Bill, we hit a home run this morning with HCAD.  They have agreed to take my 
reduced valuation on the Enron fleet.  A reduction of  $16,079,000 in taxable 
value.  This results in savings of $482,375.  That's not all, our allocation 
based on records for operations outside of the state of Texas resulted in 
additional savings of $1,559,638. Total savings to our 2000 budget will be 
$2,042,013.

Subject: Idea


AEP, ComEd, Duke and CP&L announced last week that they would be 
collaborating on a new version of a net based system better than OASIS.  I 
think that Enron should consider joining with these utilities on this.  There 
may be substantial Enron upside to such a venture from added information 
disclosure and standardization and streamlining for easier use:

On 7/14, FERC issued an Advance NOPR asking for input by 2/15/01 on OASIS 
Phase II (the new OASIS proposal).  In particular, FERC states that this new 
OASIS should address: (i) communication of critical market information (like 
transmission rights); (ii) posting of ATC, TTC, and CBM; and (ii) seams 
issues between RTOs (transmission service across multiple RTOs).  FERC says 
that the new OASIS should make use of Internet, interactive displays, etc.  
FERC also asks for information on dynamic notification (where the OASIS 
automatically alerts the customer to changes in ATC, reservations, etc.)  
This type of functionality would allow Enron to determine if it wants to stay 
in a queue when transmission becomes available (rather than getting kicked 
out after the first denial for lack of ATC.)  FERC also wants information on 
whether generator-run status should be included on OASIS; electronic 
scheduling (which can now be done via etag); and business practices that 
should be standardized.
Enron could have significant input to force these utilities to propose a 
good, customer friendly system that provides valid and helpful data on ATC, 
TTC, and CBM, rather than the total lack of substantive information that is 
available today.  (Recall that Enron proposed that CBM use be posted--FERC 
has not adopted that idea yet.)
Because these are critical utilities, any system that they propose may be 
very likely to be adopted (with some changes).  I think it is better to be in 
on the front end.  Enron's participation would also give validity to their 
system.
Dan Larcamp told me that he would like more ""classes"" for his staff from 
Enron and that we should give joint classes with AEP because Susan Tomasky 
told Dan L. that ""AEP has nothing to hide.""  This type of venture would allow 
AEP one venue to make good on that statement.
Steve K. asked us to pursue the idea that Enron build a computer system.  
This may be a good way to have significant input while leveraging these 
companies' money and promoting Enron's congestion model ideas, etc.

Late last night, the House on a 240-189 vote passed, as amended, H.R. 4 -- the Securing Amerca's Future Energy (SAFE) Act of 2001.  Here is what happened on the three amendments of interest to Enron:

	1.	The House overwhelmingly defeated (154 to 274) a Waxman Amendment (D-CA)  to impose cost of service rates on wholesale sales of electricity in the WSCC for 18 months.  Only three House Republicans supported the amendment (all from California -- Gallegly, Issa and Hunter); 57 Democrats opposed the Waxman Amendment, including all of the Texas Democrats EXCEPT Frost, Hinojosa, Rodriguez and Doggett (these four SUPPORTED the Waxman Amendment).  Thus, our collective lobbying efforts in recent months focusing on California Republicans, Texas Democrats and other moderate Democrats worked out in the end.

	2.	The House also overwhelmingly defeated the Cox Amendment (R-CA) to grant California a waiver of the Clean Air Act's oxygenate requirement for reformulated gasoline.  The vote was 125 to 300 (44 Republicans, 80 Democrats and 1 independent voted for the amendment; 173 Republicans, 126 Democrats and 1 independent) voted against it.

	3.	The House also defeated the Green Amendment (D-TX) to repeal the Natural Gas Act's ""Hinshaw Exemption"" as it applies to California's intrastate natural gas pipelines.  The vote was 154 to 275 (123 Republicans and 31 Democrats voted for it, while 95 Republicans, 178 Democrats, and 2 independents voted against the amendment).

Please call or e-mail with comments or questions.  The Senate Energy Committee is starting its work this week on an energy package with consideration of an R&D title (other issues will be taken up in September, including electricity).  The House Energy and Commerce Committee will now turn to electricity issues, with staff drafting during the August Recess, hearings in September, and votes on legislation in September or early October.","Recap of House Action Last Night on Energy Package.

Thank you, Vince.  I might have a job opening for a manager of public relations within the next week or so, and I would be happy to pass his resume along to the hiring manager.  I'll also give it to the other recruiters in case they are aware of other positions.

Hope all is well with you,

Tara,

You are right -- those changes were not included.  For Vice President level 
employees, corporate comp.does not promote guaranteed performance bonuses.  

The request that he be able to ""get out"" of his employment contract if he is 
not promoted also is not something that we can do; otherwise, it will 
undermine the enforceability of our non-competes across the board.

 I spoke with David Oxley on both of those points, and he concurred that 
these changes could not be made.

Thanks for this, Twanda

I have two comments; 

1)I cannot find the exception clause which indicates that David Pope can 
resign if he doesn't make MD as described in previous email. Am I missing 
this or can we not put this in?

2)Danny McCarty wanted guaranteed bonus for 2000 rather than performance 
target bonus as per email. Is this possible?

Thanks

I got a call today from Bob Pease, Attorney with Market Oversight and Enforcement at FERC, 202-208-0131, to invite Enron to a meeting called by Chairman Wood at the CAISO offices on 24-25 Sep 01.  The purpose of the meeting is to try to get the FERC, CAISO, DWR and other market participants to work out issues related to reliability that have arisen in recent months.  Issues include those that that affect operations and reliability such as the must-offer requirements, ramping, etc.  He was not clear as to whether they would address creditworthiness issues.  From the FERC staff ""non-decisional"" employees will attend.  He invited solutions/proposals in advance of the meeting.  Enron needs to decide who to send.

?????SACRAMENTO--Confusion over new federal price restrictions prompted=20
several electricity sellers to back away from sales to California on Monday=
=20
afternoon, pushing the state closer to blackouts, energy officials said.
?????The state lost sales that would have provided enough electricity to=20
supply more than 1 million homes, said Ray Hart, deputy director of the=20
California Department of Water Resources, which has been buying much of the=
=20
state's electricity since January.
?????At least five companies producing or marketing power ""are telling us=
=20
that since they don't know what they're going to get paid, they're not goin=

?????The electricity sales fell through after power consumption soared in=

summer heat and grid operators were forced to declare a Stage 1 emergency,=
=20
meaning reserves had dipped below 7%. It was the first such emergency since=
=20
May 31.

intended to bring down wholesale electricity markets across the West, a pow=

?????The new price is supposed to be based upon whatever it costs to run th=

grid operators during the first full hour of a Stage 1 emergency.
?????But much uncertainty remains about exactly how and when the new price =

?????Shortly after the state issued the Stage 1 alert at 1:30 p.m., putting=

the old price limit of $90 per megawatt-hour in question, companies that ha=

?????Both buyers and sellers in the market agree that the new price, when i=

Office of the Chairman:

While traveling within Germany recently, I noticed that electric powered 
trains are popular and also provide a safe, reliable, affordable and 
comfortable means of transportation to the public.

This brought to mind a question to ask you:

Is Enron taking any action to promote development and implementation of 
electric trains or light rail in the USA and/or abroad, either through the 
Political Action Committee, Lobbying or through the efforts of the Business 
Development Offices?

I do believe that the commuters would benefit from having access to electric 
trains that provide safe, clean and comfortable transport. Enron could 
potentially benefit by supplying the power for these trains within the USA 
(and abroad as well). 

Just think if the city of Houston offered light rail as an option for 
commuting to and from work, as well as commuting to other locations - both 
interstate and intrastate. A person could take a train to Galveston, Austin, 
or elsewhere and arrive in short time with the high speed rail available. 
With the new Ballpark downtown and the revitalization of the downtown area, 
it would seem that a legitimate method of public transportation is the 
element that is missing from the Houston city model. Buses that run on diesel 
are clearly not the solution for mass transit.

Steve - the issue to which I believe Jane is referring in the first sentence 
(""confirmation of the issues which I have articulated"") concern possible 
paymensts made to receive informal, and favourable, guidance, on customs 
issues (which informal opinions are now seemingly being reversed, formally).  
In some cases such payments may still be legal.  But, subject to Jane 
confirming that I am explaining this correctly (given that the communication 
below is a bit cryptic), it now seems to me to be timely (as Rebecca and Jim 
have apparently been alerted in London on Monday, per her note below) to 
satisfy yourself that we are now clean on this issue under the Foreign 
Corrupt Practices Act.  The informal customs advice was obtained by Muktesh 
Tyagi (spelling?), one of two people known as Sanjay's ""fixers"" (that should 
make you fell comfortable!).  You may wish to discuss with Jane further, but 
once you satisfy yourself that there is some smoke here, my thought was that 
you might want to simply confirm with Rebecca that we are running the facts 
to ground, so that we can satisfy ourselves that we are either clean, or need 
to come clean with USG.  let me know if you need more.   thanks mcs

Mark, I have confirmation of the issues on which I have articulated concern 
to you although such confirmation is verbal.  Apparently, there are more 
areas that I will identify in due time.  This information was conveyed to the

Subject: Summary of $ at Risk for Customs

I found out more info on some of these extraneous customs issues above and 
beyond the LNG stuff:

PHASE I ISSUES
1. SPM 
 (This equipment has already been imported at 22.38%, but customs is claiming 
merit duty rates of 67%.)
 This is currently being evaluated by the courts.
 Total Value at Risk = $7 MM
2. ""D"" - Stream
 Are Bechtel's design charges of $66 MM specific to our equipment or to the 
project as a whole? 
 If the former, then duty of 22.38% should apply.
 Total Value at Risk = $13.5 MM  ($66 MM x 22.38%)

PHASE II ISSUES
1. Services Loading on Power Plant Equipment
 Same issue as for LNG Equipment. Currently we are paying a 10% loading on 
duty into a reserve deposit to cover this.
 Total Value at Risk = $22.38 MM  ($100 MM x 22.38%)
2. LNG Equipment to be dutied at 53.8% or 22.38%?
 Think we all know this issue.
 Total Value at Risk = $56 MM (as per Risk Matrix)
3. Services Loading on LNG Equipment
 Think we all know this issue
 Total Value at Risk = $80 MM  ($149 MM x 53.8%)

TOTAL VALUE at RISK ~$180 MM - - This is WORST, WORST CASE!

Note:  There is still this issue of goods being imported under the wrong 
classification.  Currently, this is preventing goods from being imported on 
time, which could lead to delay claims by the contractors.  It will take me 
some time to hunt down what this could cost us if the problem isn't resolved 
soon.  Pavan's estimate is that it will take a month for Site to generate 
accurate equipment lists and for the same to be reviewed and approved by MSEB.

Subject: possible RTP conference


Dear Mr. Kaminski:

Thank you for talking with me about a possible RTP conference.  I would
like to include some discussions of what has been learned in other industries.

As I indicated, Frank Wolak suggested that I contact you.  In discussing
power markets with Frank and other colleagues at Stanford and EPRI, it
seems quite evident that real-time pricing for retail customers is the
""forgotten resource"" in more efficient power markets.  There seems to be a
lot of confusion about what RTP means and it also seems that many
researchers need to address some practical but important problems.  I was
asked whether a group like Stanford's EMF might explore this topic and give
it the visibility that would have it considered more seriously by
policymakers.

Frank thought that you might be someone who could help me structure a
useful approach and who might also see whether Enron could become a major
sponsor.  I was hoping that this issue was sufficiently important to Enron
that the company might consider providing $25,000.  As you may appreciate,
it requires some thought and effort to make sure that the product of the
conference is widely circulated among key government groups.

I would be very interested in hearing from you if you can provide ideas and
recommendations for people (perhaps yourself or a colleague) to
participate.  I would also appreciate any consideration by Enron of
providing funding for this effort.

Thank you,
Hill Huntington

Steve,

I am a lead recruiter at the University of California at Berkeley for
Enron Analyst/Associate program.

I contacted several friends who work at Berkeley and received an invitation
from one of them to make a presentation at the weekly Faculty Seminar
of the Dept. of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research.

The students and faculty members from the business school will be also 
invited.

Berkeley in general, and Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Research in
particular, are important centers of academic research on electricity markets
(S. Oren works very closely with Severin Borenstein).

My presentation will focus on the Analyst/Associate program. I shall  also 
have
an opportunity to discuss the power markets in California (I expect many
questions) before many experts who are very  important to shaping
public opinion and regulatory agenda.

Please, let me know who in you group could help me in preparing this 
presentation
and in presenting  Enron's point of view in a more effective way.

I understood the ""validation"" process to be a fairly flexible name applied to 
a wide variety of approaches.  What we specifically discussed, and what scott 
s. left prepared and committed to do, involved looking at individual curves, 
the assumptions underlying them and some process (yet to be specifically 
determined) for addressing updates.  We agreed to start with the top 20 
curves and especially those which are involved in the upcoming deals.

I think the confusion is in what the term validation means.  In the ENA 
context it means one thing; in this context it means what we discussed (which 
was in Jim's memo and, as you'll recall, we went through point-by-point).  
Let's just get this done.

Scott --

We should talk about what was agreed to at the meeting.  

My discussions with others indicated that both (a) a curve validation process 
and (b) a deal-by-deal review would be undertaken.  The deal-by-deal review 
is especially critical during the implementation of a structured curve 
validation process.  In addition, even when the curve validation process is 
fully up and running, we should continue looking at major position impacts in 
new transactions.  There are many curves to review.  It seems reasonable to 
look at the critical rate curves as appropriate.

Let me know.

In the interest of clarity:  It was agreed that ongoing curve validation 
consistent with that followed on wholesale curves would be instituted.  It 
was further agreed that certain information would be provided by Scott 
Stoness to get this process going.  Such ongoing validation should make the 
impractical deal-by-deal review described below both redundant and 
unnecessary. 

I assume the list below did not contemplate the type of curve validation 
process we discussed and agreed to at the meeting.

Subject: EES - RAC Deal Approval Meeting

I received word late last week that Dave Gorte (works for Rick Buy) is 
setting up a meeting to discuss the process under which EES will have its 
deals considered by RAC.

I think that we should argue that the following package of information be 
pre-assembled and provided to Govt Affairs when EES brings a deal to RAC:

1. List of each position by utility and by rate class within the deal 

2. Regulated Rate forecasts by utility and by rate class for each position in 
the deal.  Not just the ""scalars"" but also the absolute $/Mwh.

3. For each impacted position, the key assumptions contained within the 
curves - 
 a. deregulation date (if any)
 b. stranded cost roll-off date (if any)
 c. standard offer end date (if any)
 d. other rate reduction dates and amounts (if any)

4. Revenue side or Cost side contract terms that impact the deal (for 
example, movement in pricing terms given some event)

I also think that we should have at least 3 working days to review this 
package.  

If anyone can think of anything else that would ease our analysis, I would be 
game.

Thanks.

JDS

		 Subject: Hendricks


The complaint,albeit brief, filed May 1 in San Diego Superior Court by 
Strategy Integration, Inc versus Michael Aguirre and the other Hendricks  
plaintiffs' attorneys is quite extraordinary in its disclosure. A hard copy 
is being faxed. The expert firm alleges they were ""retained...to explain, 
research, and investigate potential claims of gaming and collusion by energy 
providers who supply electricity to the California Energy Market ...[and] 
...retained to perform utility and energy consulting services."" After 
alleging that the Hendricks attorneys ""refused to pay Plaintiffs' first 
billing""  it is alleged that""defendants' refusal may have resulted from the 
conclusions Plaintiff drew in its analysis."" We should consider if there is 
there a way to get this filing to Senator Dunn's office or a more friendly 
Senator  without identifying us as the source,.They can see what some expert 
in the field  hired by the plaintiffs'  class action lawyers apparently 
concluded on their own about the claims of gaming and collusion. I suspect 
that  Sen Dunn has no interest but some Republican Senator might have some 
use for it. It could  have some value if the hearings go forward. This is not 
urgent timewise but I wanted to bring it to your attention.

Vince,

I am in the office today, and am just wondering if you are still meeting with Debra from Rice's Communications dept.  If so, I would still like to join you when you meet at 3:00.

The letter looks good.  A couple of comments for your consideration:

 efforts of its kind in other markets, is designed to separate the competit=

business (eg distribution).  The competitive market can not be solely relie=

Last night I attended the National Republican Senatorial Committee's 
reception at Senator Frist's home in DC.  (Frist is the NRSC chairman this 
cycle.)  Enron, including Jeff and Linda, had been invited to the reception, 
the purpose of which was to introduce ex-RNC chairman Haley Barbour as the 
NRSC's National Finance Chairman.  Present were over a dozen Republican 
senators, including Minority Leader Lott, Whip Nickles, and Sens. Kay Bailey 
Hutchison, Bunning (KY), Fitzgerald (IL), Cochran (MS), Inhofe (OK), Bond 
(MO), Crapo (ID), Voinovich (OH), Allen (VA), and Chafee (RI).

The ""news"" from our perspective is that Haley Barbour singled out Ken Lay for 
praise as the first person to step to the plate and agree to help with their 
new ""Majority Makers"" program.  This is the effort that Barbour will head up 
to raise $21 million for this election cycle by concentrating on events 
outside DC that would target businesses and business leaders without a DC 
presence.  Barbour said that Ken had agreed to organize and chair a Houston 
fundraiser to raise $1 million toward the $21 million total.  Ken was the 
first name he mentioned.  The only others were the DeVos family in Michigan 
and Julie Finley, a major GOP fundraiser based in DC.

Needless to say, I was suddenly quite ""popular"" after Haley made his remarks 
to the assembled group.  Haley said he looked forward to working with us on 
this project.

As you know from a previous e-mail, Pat Shortridge had earlier seen our 
mutual friend Mitch Bainwol, the executive director of the NRSC, who had told 
Pat at lunch last week that Haley had spoken with Ken, but last night was the 
first I had heard a dollar figure -- and a big one at that -- linked to the 
effort.  While it was not stated, I assume from the location and size of the 
event's goal that the President would be involved (but this is only an 
educated assumption on my part).

Later I saw Karen Hughes of the White House staff, but I do not think she was 
present when Haley made his comments.","Ken Lay Mention At NRSC Reception Last Night. Last night I attended the National Republican Senatorial Committee's reception at Senator Frist's home in DC.

I attended the U.C. Berkeley POWER (Program on Workable Energy Regulation)
Conference on March 16.  Here is a brief report on the relevant parts.
Notably, the Lieff, Cabreser duo of Bill Bernstein and Barry Himmelstein
were there, listening carefully.

The program consisted of the presentation of 8 economic studies, followed by
comments from two discussants, followed by audience questions/comments.  The
following is a list of the papers and the discussants who presented with
slides, taken from the website of the U.C. Energy Institute,
http://www.ucei.berkeley.edu/ucei/conf2001/order_papers2001.html:  You can
click on this to see the slides, in PDF format.  The papers in green are not
particularly relevant for our purposes, and I won't say more about them
beyond the note in brackets.  The presenter's name is in bold.

  ""Bidding Asymmetries in Multi-Unit Auctions: Implications of
Bid Function Equilibria in the British Spot Market for Electricity"" by Greg
Crawford, Duke University, Joe Crespo, NERA, and Helen Tauchen, University
of North Carolina
  ""Pricing and Firm Conduct in California's Deregulated
Electricity Market"" by Steve Puller, UC Berkeley
   Discussion by Anjali Sheffrin, California
Independent System Operator
  ""Identification and Estimation of Cost Functions Using
Observed Bid Data: An Application to Electricity Markets"" by Frank Wolak,
Stanford University [A paper about economic ""tools"" to study power markets.]
  ""Forward Contracts and the Curse of Market Power"" by Jeffrey
Lien , University of Maryland
  ""The Impact of Retail Rate Deregulation on Electricity
Consumption in San Diego"" by James Bushnell and Erin Mansur, UC Berkeley
[This looks at whether consumption declined with price increases.  Not
much.]
  ""Consumption and Home Energy Costs: How Prevalent is the
'Heat or Eat' Decision?"" by Julie Berry Cullen, University of Michigan,
Leora Friedberg, University of Virginia, and Catherin Wolfram, UC Berkeley
[A macro study on how consumers change overall spending patterns when they
have to shell out more $$ for power.]
  ""A Quantitative Analysis of Pricing Behavior in California's
Wholesale Electricity Market During Summer 2000"" by Paul Joskow, MIT, and
Edward Kahn, Analysis Group
  ""Electricity Restructuring and the Cost of Pollution
Reduction"" by Dallas Burtraw, Karen Palmer, Ranjit Bharvirkar, and Anthony
Paul, Resources for the Future

Before I discuss the specific papers and presenters, one big picture point
needs to be made.  There was an unchallenged consensus at this conference
that the generators have exercised market power to the tune of billions of
dollars.  The focus was on how and how much, not whether.  The good news is
that I heard no evidence supporting any collusion theory; the thought was
that generators are making independent output and pricing decisions knowing
they could influence the market price given the auction rules and the
completely inelastic demand.  On the other hand, I would have to say that
the economic work on the tacit collusion hypothesis in incomplete at best.
The bad news is that the scale of potential overcharges is pretty staggering
-- >$5 billion.  The plaintiffs will be able to put together quite a damage
study.

Crespo, Bidding Asymmetries in UK:  This is a marginally relevant paper
examining whether bidders in the UK electricity auction markets behaved in a
leader-follower mode, i.e., asymmetrically.  Crespo's model shows that in a
uniform price-setting auction with clearing price rules, a price setter will
emerge and take all prices above marginal cost.  Thus, above marginal cost
pricing does not require coordination.  Crespo (from NERA) appeared
knowledgeable, but is not an inspiring speaker.  His paper also got roughed
up a bit in the audience questioning segment.

Puller, Pricing and Firm Conduct in California's Deregulated Electricity
Market:  This is a very relevant paper, as it tries to determine whether
market power (presumably) exercised in California was static or dynamic,
meaning the product of individual firm decisionmaking (static) or tacit
collusion (dynamic).  The period studied was 4/98 to 12/99.  Puller found
evidence of static market power consistent with so-called ""Cournot pricing.""
This theory posits that in an oligopoly firms will take their rivals'
observed price/output decisions as a given and decide how to maximize
profitability given that behavior.  He then tried to determine whether any
dynamic games were occurring, meaning a game where firms recognize their
interdependence and try to follow a ""supergame trigger strategy"" in which
firms try to induce favorable responses from rivals.  It's quite complicated
how he goes about this, but fundamentally he tries to correlate observed
output decisions with how a firm at that time might have expected a change
in its behavior to affect its future share of the market.  With this
methodology, Puller finds what he called ""weak evidence"" of forward-looking
dynamic pricing for a brief time in 1998, but not otherwise.  My impression
was that the evidence for 1998 was very weak, and the logic used to arrive
at this conclusion was also weak.

Puller then went at this a second time with a theory that attempts to
determine what a firm's ""supply function"" would look like if it was
exercising static and dynamic market power, and then comparing this to an
estimate of that firm's actual supply function.  I found this even more
speculative than the first theory.  Nonetheless, the results are basically
the same:  evidence of static, but not dynamic market power.

Puller took a lot of heat for the methodology of this paper during the
questioning segment.  He's not a dynamic speaker and does not appear to me
to be a strong expert candidate.

Anjali Sheffrin's commentary was very important.  She is the Director of
Market Analysis for CAISO.  After general comments on Crespo and Puller, she
launched in to a discussion of whether their models explained the California
experience.  This turned out to be a preview of the CAISO FERC filing of
last week, in which they allege $5.5 billion in market power-related
overcharges from May 200 to Feb. 2001.  That filing and Sheffrin's report
follow.  They are essential reading.

  <<2001032214541122276.pdf.pdf>>  <<2001032214585222924.pdf.pdf>>

Sheffrin maintains that it was the absence of imports during this period
that left the market power of the California generators unchecked.  This
permitted the in-state generators to engage in either economic or physical
withholding of power.  (Economic withholding is bidding a higher-than-needed
supply curve; physical withholding is cutting output at the plant.)  Her
study was intended to (1) Identify individual firms engaging in market power
activity, and (2) Analyze how each firms' actions set market clearing
prices.  She utilized full bidding data in CA ISO real time market for
each hour between May and Nov 2000, defined and categorized bidding patterns
and identified economic or physical withholding, and then calculated
bid-cost mark-up and a monopoly rent.  She found what she claimed was strong
evidence of both types of withholding, but that economic withholding is the
dominant bidding pattern used by the five large California generators.
While Sheffrin's study does not name names, it claims that ""most of the five
in-state suppliers and many of the [16] large importers displayed bidding
patterns which were consistent with the exercise of market power.""

Bernstein and Himmelstein were positively gleeful during this presentation.

On the question of collusion, Sheffrin's study is not terribly illuminating.
She maintains that ""the dominant bidding pattern is consistent with two
characteristics of a supply function equilibrium model of oligopolist
pricing.""  I take that to mean Cournot, which is a static, non-collusive
model.  However, when you read her study, you'll see the picture is not
entirely clear.

Lien, The Curse of Market Power:  This is only marginally relevant for us,
as its thesis is that forward-looking supply contracts are better for both
producers and society.  Everyone seemed to agree -- and were confused why we
needed a paper to prove it.  Lien (U. Md.) is young and not expert material.

Joskow and Kahn:  http://www.mit.edu/people/pjoskow/JK_PaperREVISED.pdf
(paper);  http://www.ucei.berkeley.edu/ucei/conf2001/Slides/Kahn_Slides.pdf
(Kahn's slides).   I'm sure many of you have already read this; everyone
should.  Prepared for SoCal Edison, it contends that 4 in-state generators
(Reliant, Dynegy, AES/Williams, and Southern/Mirant) exercised market power
by withholding capacity during the summer or 2000.

J&K use publicly available data on loads, market prices and generation to
(a) quantify combined effects of ""market fundamentals"" on market prices, (b)
calculate ""price gap"" (difference between actual prices and ""competitive""
market benchmarks), (c) account for quantify effects of ISO's ancillary
services requirements and forced outages, and then (d) calculate the ""output
gap"" for high priced hours, meaning the difference between observed and
maximum profitable levels of generation.  They conclude that prices were far
in excess of the competitive benchmark and that the 4 in-state generators
could have produced more power at competitive prices but chose not to.
Hence, market power was exercised.

Kahn, the Analysis Group economist who presented, is a very colorful and
rather undisciplined advocate of his position.  He threw around allegations
of conspiracy rather casually, but mostly to be funny.  I couldn't tell
whether he believed his study proved that; I don't think it even speaks to
it.  But Bernstein and Himmelstein applauded him when he finished, grinning
ear to ear.

Severin Borenstein, UC Berkeley and the conference director, was supposed to
comment on J&K, but hardly did.  He said that the generators would have been
stupid not to exercise market power given the supply/demand conditions and
the market rules, and argued that permitting long term contracts and
requiring real-time residential pricing were the solutions to all of this.
Borenstein was the best expert material I saw at this conference, and the
fact he took a pass on the details of the J&K paper is puzzling to me.  It
made me wonder whether he already has a horse in this race, or perhaps is
trying to ""stay above it all.""

Hope this is useful.

 - 2001032214585222924.pdf.pdf","Report on POWER Conference. I attended the U.C. Berkeley POWER (Program on Workable Energy Regulation) Conference on March 16. Here is a brief report on the relevant parts. Notably, the Lieff, Cabreser duo of Bill Bernstein and Barry Himmelstein were there, listening carefully. The program consisted of the presentation of 8 economic studies, followed by comments from two discussants, followed by audience questions/comments. The following is a list of the papers and the discussants who presented with slides, taken from the website of the U.C. Energy Institute, http://www.ucei.berkeley.edu/ucei/conf2001/order_papers2001.html: You can click on this to see the slides, in PDF format. The papers in green are not particularly relevant for our purposes, and I won't say more about them beyond the note in brackets. The presenter's name is in bold. ""Bidding Asymmetries in Multi-Unit Auctions: Implications of Bid Function Equilibria in the British Spot Market for Electricity"" by Greg Crawford, Duke University, Joe Crespo, NERA, and Helen Tauchen, University of North Carolina ""Pricing and Firm Conduct in California's Deregulated Electricity Market"" by Steve Puller, UC Berkeley Discussion by Anjali Sheffrin, California Independent System Operator ""Identification and Estimation of Cost Functions Using Observed Bid Data: An Application to Electricity Markets"" by Frank Wolak, Stanford University [A paper about economic ""tools"" to study power markets.] ""Forward Contracts and the Curse of Market Power"" by Jeffrey Lien , University of Maryland ""The Impact of Retail Rate Deregulation on Electricity Consumption in San Diego"" by James Bushnell and Erin Mansur, UC Berkeley [This looks at whether consumption declined with price increases. Not much.] ""Consumption and Home Energy Costs: How Prevalent is the 'Heat or Eat' Decision?"" by Julie Berry Cullen, University of Michigan, Leora Friedberg, University of Virginia, and Catherin Wolfram, UC Berkeley [A macro study on how consumers change overall spending patterns when they have to shell out more $$ for power.] ""A Quantitative Analysis of Pricing Behavior in California's Wholesale Electricity Market During Summer 2000"" by Paul Joskow, MIT, and Edward Kahn, Analysis Group ""Electricity Restructuring and the Cost of Pollution Reduction"" by Dallas Burtraw, Karen Palmer, Ranjit Bharvirkar, and Anthony Paul, Resources for the Future Before I discuss the specific papers and presenters, one big picture point needs to be made. There was an unchallenged consensus at this conference that the generators have exercised market power to the tune of billions of dollars. The focus was on how and how much, not whether. The good news is that I heard no evidence supporting any collusion theory; the thought was that generators are making independent output and pricing decisions knowing they could influence the market price given the auction rules and the completely inelastic demand. On the other hand, I would have to say that the economic work on the tacit collusion hypothesis in incomplete at best. The bad news is that the scale of potential overcharges is pretty staggering -- >$5 billion. The plaintiffs will be able to put together quite a damage study. Crespo, Bidding Asymmetries in UK: This is a marginally relevant paper examining whether bidders in the UK electricity auction markets behaved in a leader-follower mode, i.e., asymmetrically. Crespo's model shows that in a uniform price-setting auction with clearing price rules, a price setter will emerge and take all prices above marginal cost. Thus, above marginal cost pricing does not require coordination. Crespo (from NERA) appeared knowledgeable, but is not an inspiring speaker. His paper also got roughed up a bit in the audience questioning segment. Puller, Pricing and Firm Conduct in California's Deregulated Electricity Market: This is a very relevant paper, as it tries to determine whether market power (presumably) exercised in California was static or dynamic, meaning the product of individual firm decisionmaking (static) or tacit collusion (dynamic). The period studied was 4/98 to 12/99. Puller found evidence of static market power consistent with so-called ""Cournot pricing."" This theory posits that in an oligopoly firms will take their rivals' observed price/output decisions as a given and decide how to maximize profitability given that behavior. He then tried to determine whether any dynamic games were occurring, meaning a game where firms recognize their interdependence and try to follow a ""supergame trigger strategy"" in which firms try to induce favorable responses from rivals. It's quite complicated how he goes about this, but fundamentally he tries to correlate observed output decisions with how a firm at that time might have expected a change in its behavior to affect its future share of the market.

I was thinking of you recently wen speaking with a Congressional

increasing prices from the utilities, he was searching for an energy 
solution.  Who would be the best contact within EES or ENA to explore the

Would buying boycott help lower California's electricity bill?
By MICHAEL LIEDTKE
AP Business Writer

05/03/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - There's a limit to how much people will pay for most 
things in life. If the cost scares off enough buyers, prices eventually fall. 
So what would happen if this textbook example from Economics 101 were applied 
to California's electricity crisis? What if the state officials struggling to 
maintain energy supplies simply refused to buy power above a certain price 
and accepted more blackouts this summer?
The question would have been absurd just a few months ago and even now the 
notion seems surreal, given the possible consequences. 
Inviting even more blackouts inevitably would hurt businesses and frustrate 
consumers, threatening to further depress California's already slumping 
economy - the sixth largest in the world. 
But desperate times require drastic measures, according to the economists, 
lawmakers and activists who believe the state will be better off sitting in 
the dark than buying electricity at any price during a summer shortage likely 
to produce recurring blackouts anyway. 
""It's better to use (blackouts) and break the (wholesale energy) cartel than 
simply to suffer them,"" said Michael Shames, executive director of the 
Utility Consumer Action Network, a San Diego watchdog group. 
Refusing to buy enough power to keep the lights on ""would be like playing 
with fire,"" counters Wells Fargo & Co. chief economist Sung Won Sohn. 
""Blackouts aren't a just matter of inconvenience or being too hot or cold. 
They cost businesses a lot of money."" 
Buying electricity at the last minute to meet the state's power needs already 
has cost the California government $5.7 billion in the past 3 1/2 months. The 
state energy bill for 2001 could reach $50 billion, in money otherwise spent 
on education, public safety and health care, Shames said. 
Faced with the prospect of a significant budget deficit, some lawmakers think 
it's time for California to take a stand against the power wholesalers - many 
of whom are based outside the state. 
This Tuesday, the state Senate Energy Committee will consider authorizing the 
state to refuse to buy power above certain prices. Current law requires state 
electricity managers to avoid blackouts by buying all available power at any 
cost. 
""We have been over a barrel in so many ways,"" said Sen. Dede Alpert, 
D-Coronado, who sponsored SB73x. ""Maybe there's a point in the market where 
(we) just say no and go with the planned blackout strategy instead."" 
Economists give the bill little chance of succeeding. 
""It's never going to happen. It's not a viable option,"" said University of 
California at Berkeley Professor Severin Borenstein, one of the energy 
experts who have studied the idea. 
The business lost during blackouts would mean more layoffs in a state already 
skittish over the technology downturn and the looming Hollywood writers 
strike, economists say. 
Other ripple effects include diminished gasoline supplies, leading to even 
higher prices at the pump, and distribution headaches that could leave store 
shelves bare. 
And some consumers - the elderly and the infirm, for example, need power at 
any price. 
Without electricity, Manteca resident Betty Jarzemkoski said she wouldn't be 
able to help her ailing husband to get out of his motorized bed at home. 
""It would be a real hardship for us,"" said Jarzemkoski, 78. ""I'm on a fixed 
income so I hope they can figure out something to bring down prices. But we 
need power."" 
Despite such concerns, the concept of a buyer's boycott hasn't been flatly 
ruled out - at least publicly - by Gov. Gray Davis as he struggles to reduce 
the state's staggering electricity bill. 
The state is spending as much as $90 million per day to meet California's 
electricity needs and the bleeding is sure to get worse. When the summer heat 
increases demand and tightens supplies, California might spend more than $1 
billion each week, state officials estimate. 
Extended blackouts pose an even greater cost, economists say. 
When Northern California suffered rolling blackouts for several hours Jan. 
18-19, the economic losses totaled $2.3 billion, mostly from lost profits and 
wages, estimated the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp. 
Multiply that over several weeks across the entire state, and it becomes 
apparent why it makes more sense for California to continue buying power at 
inflated prices, even if leaves the state with deep debts and a ruined credit 
rating, economists argue. 
As it is, California probably won't be able to round up enough power at any 
price on some days this summer, making some blackouts a virtual certainty. 
The blackouts will reduce the state's economic output by $2 billion to $16 
billion, according to a study released last month by the Bay Area Economic 
Forum. 
The resolve of the state's politicians and ratepayers would be sorely tested 
for a boycott to succeed, much in the way that labor strikes boil down to 
whether workers or management can withstand more financial pain. 
""Politicians aren't going to willingly turn out the lights because 
politicians want to get re-elected,"" said Borenstein, director of the 
University of California's energy institute. ""As soon as people start losing 
their jobs because the power is off, the public will get tired of the 
blackouts real quick."" 
Still, Californians might tolerate an increase in blackouts if they 
understand why the state chose to pursue such a drastic course, said Stanford 
economics Professor Frank Wolak, who heads the Independent System Operator's 
market surveillance committee. 
""This isn't something you could do without an enormous public relations 
campaign,"" he said. ""The campaign would have to explain that the state had no 
other choice but to do this because (federal power regulators) aren't doing 
their job and enforcing the law against unjust and unreasonable prices."" 
The largest out-of-state generators are in such robust financial shape that 
it might take weeks before they would feel such pain from a California 
boycott that they would be forced to lower prices. 
After making record profits last year, power wholesalers Enron, Reliant, 
Dynegy, Duke Energy, Williams and Mirant and earned a combined $1.6 billion 
during the first three months of this year.

INDIA: Indian banks appeal to govt to help end Enron row

05/03/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
BOMBAY, May 3 (Reuters) - Indian lenders to U.S. energy group Enron Corp's 
gas-fired power plant south of Bombay have appealed to the Indian government 
to help end the company's row with a state-owned electricity board over 
pricing and upaid bills. 
The board of Enron's Indian unit, Dabhol Power Co (DPC) has authorised 
management to stop selling power to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board 
(MSEB) if a bitter dispute over pricing and unpaid bills cannot be resolved.
In the past half year the MSEB has defaulted on bills for electricity 
supplied by Dabhol, which operates the world's largest gas-fired plant on the 
west coast of India, 160 kilometres (100 miles) south of Bombay. 
Indian financial institutions, which contributed $1.4 billion towards the 
project in loans, are pressing the government to help end the crisis, a 
source told Reuters. 
""We have asked the government for help. We are awaiting their reply,"" the 
source, who is employed with a large financial institution, said. 
The domestic lenders to the project are Industrial Development Bank of India 
, ICICI Ltd , Industrial Finance Corporation of India , Canara Bank and State 
Bank of India . 
The Dabhol Power Company (DPC), owned 65 percent by Enron, last month took 
the major step of bailing out of the $2.9 billion power project, citing 
non-payment of bills by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). 
The DPC board's move sparked widespread fears that India's image as a safe 
destination for foreign direct investment would be damaged. 
POWER STRUGGLE 
MSEB, which is a state-owned utility, has been a regular defaulter on 
payments to DPC saying that it finds the power too costly. It has also backed 
out on its commitment to buy more power to be produced by the project's 
second phase which is to begin operations later this year. 
Last month MSEB said it had paid Dabhol Power 1.34 billion rupees ($28.60 
million) for electricity it bought in March. 
But the payment only partially resolves the total overdue amount of 2.26 
billion rupees ($48.2 million), which Enron has been unable to collect even 
after invoking guarantees issued by the government of Maharashtra, India's 
most industrialised state, and the federal government. 
The state utility still owes Enron payments for power purchases in December 
and January. 
The Indian government has maintained that the contract must be renegotiated 
and has set up a committee to do so. 
""We are concerned and would like the renegotiations to happen fast,"" the 
source added. 
The dispute has raised fears that Enron could pull the plug on the project, 
cease providing power to the local state electricity board and perhaps even 
sell the plant. 
""The plant is good, Maharashtra needs power and I am sure buyers can be 
found,"" the source added. ($1=46.82 Indian rupees).




DNC: Special Interests Write Bush Energy Policy

05/03/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

WASHINGTON, May 3 /PRNewswire/ -- The Democratic National Committee issued 
the following today: 
Dick Cheney began dropping hints this week as to what the Bush energy policy 
will look like, and it is long on oil and short on conservation. But 
something was missing from the coverage of Cheney's announcement: not just 
who benefits from the Bush plan, but who's writing it as well. (Photo: 
http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20000107/DCF015 ) 
It's hard to understate the influence big donors and high-ranking executives 
have with the Bush Administration. Take Tom Kuhn, for example, one of the 
energy executives who came calling when Bush was thinking about actually 
following through on his pledge to limit carbon dioxide levels. Kuhn, a top 
Bush fundraiser, also served on Bush's Energy Department transition advisory 
team, and still enjoys access to the highest reaches of the Bush White House. 
Not surprisingly then, the Big Oil Bush Administration's energy policy could 
not make Bush's huge donors and the special interests in the energy business 
any happier. Since the energy industry's problems are Bush's problems, the 
first things on Bush's hit list are the environmental regulations that keep 
Big Energy in check -- and our country clean. 
With an energy executive running around the West Wing, Bush's energy policy 
could be summed up as, ""Drill anywhere, anytime, and keep those checks 
coming."" 
The Democratic Party is committed to fighting for a balanced energy policy 
that keeps our country's priorities -- such as a clean environment -- in 
mind. 
To learn more about Bush's misplaced priorities and kowtows to the special 
interests, keep reading to find out the ""Top Ten Paybacks To The Energy 
Industry,"" and to see how you, too, can get on the Bush gravy train in 
""Recipe for a Quid Pro Quo,"" courtesy of the Democratic Party's 
http://www.100DaysofBush.com. 
BUSH'S TOP TEN PAYBACKS TO THE ENERGY INDUSTRY 
One of the most obvious and recurring themes of Bush's first 100 days has 
been the extraordinary influence the oil and gas industry has had in the new 
administration. Oil and gas interests are some of Bush's top campaign 
contributors, giving more than $3 million to get Bush elected. In exchange, 
Bush has rolled back regulations issued by the Clinton administration on such 
things as air conditioner efficiency, as well as breaking his campaign 
promise to regulate carbon dioxide emissions. Bush has proposed drilling in 
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and national monuments. Bush has taken a 
backseat when it comes to the energy crisis California is experiencing, while 
cutting funding for energy conservation programs. He has also repaid top 
donors, lobbyists and industry officials with key positions throughout his 
administration. 
Here is just a sampling of how the oil, gas and other energy industries have 
benefited in Bush's first 100 days: 
2 - BUSH TAKES HANDS-OFF APPROACH TO CALIFORNIA CRISIS WHILE ENERGY COMPANIES 
MAKE MILLIONS 
Bush Did Little to Aid California in Energy Crisis; Fleischer Said Crisis is 
a ""California Matter."" Bush has done little to aid California in its energy 
crisis, such as refusing to support wholesale price caps on electricity. 
White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said, ""The president continues to believe 
that the issue is mostly a California matter, dealing with the legislation 
that is before the state. And the leaders of California are working to 
address that in their own right."" Fleischer also said that Bush wanted to 
focus on a ""long term"" national energy policy. (AAP Newsfeed, 1/23/01; Wall 
Street Journal, 1/23/01) 
Texas Energy Company Accused of Price Gouging to Make Money off California's 
Energy Crisis. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered further 
inquiry into allegations by California officials that El Paso Natural Gas 
Co., a Houston based subsidiary of El Paso Energy Co., manipulated the 
natural gas market by keeping supply artificially low, contributing to the 
high price of electricity in the state. El Paso Energy was one of the Texas 
firms ""grandfathered"" by Bush's voluntary emissions standards in Texas. 
Between 1993 and 1998, El Paso Energy and El Paso Natural Gas PACs gave a 
total of $8,000 to Bush's gubernatorial campaigns. During the 1999-2000 
election cycle, El Paso Energy Corp. and El Paso Natural Gas Co. gave a total 
of $743,029 to Bush and the GOP -- $460,395 to GOP in soft money, $247,750 to 
GOP candidates from its PAC, and $34,884 to the Bush campaign from its 
employees and executives. (www.opensecrets.org; Los Angeles Times, 3/30/01; 
tebb.epenergy.com; Boston Globe, 10/3/99) 
Electricity Wholesalers Reported ""Gigantic Earnings Surges"" from Energy 
Crisis. According to the Los Angeles Times, several electricity wholesalers 
to California reported ""gigantic earnings surges"" for the quarter ended March 
31. The following companies, all contributors to Bush, have earned record 
profits off of the energy crisis in California. 
(Los Angeles Times, 4/18/01) 
COMPANY TOTAL TO BUSH COMPANY PROFIT 
Enron Corp. Enron is Bush's largest Enron's operating income was career 
patron, giving at $406 million in the first 
least $563,000 for his quarter of 2001, compared campaigns, including his 
with $338 million in the 1978 House campaign. same period last year, a 20% 
(San Diego Union-Tribune, increase.(Los Angeles Times, 2/11/01) 4/18/01) 

6 - BUSH'S TRANSITION TEAMS 
Energy Interests Dominated Bush Transition Energy Advisory Team. Big energy

UK: INTERVIEW-Innogy starts trading power in mainland Europe
By Stuart Penson

05/03/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - British utility Innogy said on Thursday it had 
started trading wholesale electricity on the French-Italian border and was 
set to enter the German power market. 
""We have done some wholesale trading on the Italy-France border, moving power 
from France to Italy, and we are very close to doing some in Germany,"" said 
director of trading Tony West in an interview with Reuters.
""This year we will significantly increase our trading in (mainland) Europe; 
we are discussing relationships with counterparties at the moment,"" he added. 
Innogy is building a European power trading team at its headquarters in 
Swindon, southern England, from where it already trades the UK gas and power 
markets. 
FRANCE COULD BE KEY MARKET 
West said the company initially had expected the main focus of its European 
trading strategy to be Germany and the north west of the continent. 
But the early signs were that France would also play a key role, particularly 
as Innogy had gained access to capacity in the UK-France undersea 
interconnector cable. 
""France has taken me by surprise. It might be more important than we 
anticipated although there are clearly still issues about the speed of 
liberalisation,"" said West. 
A core of about eight companies regularly trade power in France, including 
TXU Europe, Enron and a trading alliance between Endesa and Morgan Stanley 
Dean Witter, according to traders. 
West said Innogy had so far concentrated on buying power in France, not 
always from French companies, and taking it to Italy via the cross border 
interconnector between the two countries. 
Innogy had bought some of the 400-megawatts available on the interconnector 
through recent auctions, he said. 
""It's easy to trade through France, the cost of taking power through to the 
border is minuscule, although buying power in France and then selling it in 
France is a lot more difficult,"" said West. 
He said Innogy had signed grid balancing agreements with French transmission 
grid operator RTE. 
Andy Duff, managing director of generation and trading, added France could 
become become important for Innogy on a retail level, as well as a trading 
level, depending on how effectively the UK-France interconnector could be 
used. 
""The European market will be driven by the operation of interconnectors and 
transmission services as well as exchanges,"" said Duff. 
Innogy may look to trade on Germany's two power exchanges as well as that 
country's burgeoning over-the-counter market. 
The company is in the process of signing standard trading agreements for 
Germany based on the terms devised by the industry group the European 
Federation of Energy Traders (EFET). 
FOCUS ON TRADING, NOT ASSETS 
Duff said Innogy's strategy in Europe was to focus on trading but not the 
acquisition of physical assets. 
""We are not going to lead with assets in Europe. We will focus on trading 
services-type arrangements, extracting value from (other companies') assets. 
That's the main thrust of the business,"" he said. 
West said Innogy's trading in mainland Europe would expand into natural gas 
as opportunities emerged. The company already trades around the UK-Belgium 
gas interconnector.

European Phone Companies' Outlook Brightens: Rates of Return

European Phone Companies' Outlook Brightens: Rates of Return

     London, May 3 (Bloomberg) -- European telephone companies
such as British Telecommunications Plc and Deutsche Telekom AG
have improved their ability to pay back debt in recent weeks,
making their bonds a buy, investors said.
     ``Sentiment seems to be changing,'' said Anna Lees-Jones,
who helps manage about 28 billion pounds ($40 billion) of
corporate bonds at M&G Investment Management. ``I've been
building up my telecoms position all year.''
     British Telecom's 10-year euro-denominated bonds sold in
January yield about 214 basis points more than government debt,
down from a record 238 in March. Contracts that pay out if the
company goes bankrupt have also fallen in the past month,
according to Enron Corp., which trades the derivatives.
     Bond yields and bankruptcy derivatives have also declined for
Deutsche Telekom and Royal KPN NV, after the companies said they
would sell assets to pay down debt that has pushed their credit
ratings to record lows and weighed on their shares. Phone
companies sold $100 billion of bonds last year to finance licenses
and equipment for new mobile services.
     British Telecom said yesterday it will sell its stakes in
Japan Telecom Co. and Spain's Airtel SA to Vodafone Group for 4.8
billion pounds. British Telecom may also sell as much as 7.5
billion pounds of shares to existing investors in a so-called
rights offer, according to Legal & General Group Plc, one of the
company's shareholders.
     Deutsche Telekom will sell assets such as cable television,
and a stake in Global One and Wind SpA, Chief Financial Officer
Karl-Gerhard Eick said last week. KPN, the biggest Dutch phone
company, said on March 26 it plans to raise at least 5 billion
euros from asset sales to lower debt.
     Those plans have helped shift investors' perceptions of the
companies' creditworthiness, money managers said.

                       `Drastic Measures'

     ``At the beginning of the year the market was assuming
telecoms companies would be downgraded from single-A to triple-
B,'' said Peter Harvey, who helps run about $8.6 billion at F&C
Management. ``Drastic measures such as deeply-discounted rights
issues led investors to believe they will maintain their single-A
status.''
     The gap, or spread, between British Telecom's sterling
denominated bonds maturing in 2006, and U.K. five-year government
bonds has narrowed 50 basis points to 109 basis points in the
past month. Spreads between Deutsche Telekom's 6.125 percent five-
year euro bonds and German government debt narrowed 35 basis
points to 107 in April.

                      Bankruptcy Swaps Fall

     Those shifts in sentiment are also reflected in Enron's
bankruptcy swaps, where prices have fallen in the past month,
said Simon Brooks, a trader at Enron.
     Enron prices the swaps using indexes that measure the
probability of bankruptcy and the likely recovery rate in that
event. The price is expressed as a percentage above a benchmark
interest rate such as the London interbank offered rate, or
Libor.
     British Telecom bankruptcy swaps have declined to 66 basis
points from 96 on April 1, Enron said. Bankruptcy swaps on
Deutsche Telekom dropped to 78 from 100, while KPN's fell to 135
from 183. Over the same period, France Telecom SA's declined to
70 from 100 and Telecom Italia SpA's fell to 94 from 119.
     British Telecom's bond yields may fall further relative to
government debt, analysts said. They still offer higher yields
than those of rival Vodafone Group Plc, which has the same
ratings though with a stable outlook.
     While both companies have five-year euro-denominated bonds,
British Telecom's offer 55 basis points more yield. The rivals
also both have bonds maturing in 2004, and Vodafone's yield about
23 basis points fewer.
     ``If BT retains their rating, their spreads should be
probably 20 to 30 basis points narrower,'' said Brian Venables,
head of credit strategy at WestLB. ``Even though it has performed
extremely well this year, there is much greater potential for
BT's debt.''

                      Debt Reduction Target

     Both Moody's Investors Service, which rates British Telecom
``A2'', and Standard & Poor's, which rates it ``A'', have those
ratings on watch for further cuts after trimming them four rungs
last year.
     The company's asset sales to Vodafone are ``definitely
positive in terms of the rating assessment,'' said Aidan Fisher,
who rates British Telecom for Moody's. In combination with the
proceeds of a rights sale, ``that would meet the target they set
themselves this year -- that's quite a lot to achieve in a 12
month period.''
     British Telecom has said it wants to slash its 30 billion
pounds of debt by a third and fend off further rating cuts.
     Before companies such as British Telecom clarified their
debt-reduction plans, ``the world and his wife were underweight''
telecom bonds in March, said Harvey at F&C. The investment firm
has since raised its holding of telecom bonds to neutral, from
underweight, relative to its benchmark, he said.
     Bond yields ``were trading very much out of line to the rest
of the market,'' said Lees-Jones at M&G. Now, ``they have come in
quite a bit and will come in further.''

UK:Corporates warm to charms of credit derivatives
By Tom Bergin

05/03/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - European corporates are beginning to turn to credit 
derivatives, among the more esoteric and complex of financial instruments, to 
hedge the risk their debtors won't pay up, market participants said on 
Thursday.

Credit derivatives are insurance-like tools that allow users to hedge the 
risk of default on a debt. They are mainly used by banks, hedge funds and 
insurance companies to hedge or gain exposure to the risk of a bond issuer 
defaulting. Dealers said an environment of deteriorating credit quality and a 
growing awareness among corporates that credit derivatives offer certain 
advantages over established hedging tools was behind the increasing use of 
the instruments.

The market remains small, with only around a dozen non-financial European 
corporates regularly using credit derivatives to manage their credit 
portfolio at present. But market professionals predict they will one day 
become as commonplace in the corporate world as other hedging tools such as 
interest rate swaps and currency options.

""We see (corporate use) as a big growth area for credit derivatives, maybe 
the biggest,"" says Bryan Seyfried, vice-president of Enron Credit in London.

Enron Credit grew out of the efforts of energy company Enron Corp. to hedge 
its own credit risk portfolio and now specialises in marketing credit risk 
management solutions to other non-financial corporates.

Ralf Lierow, director of credit derivatives at Siemens Financial Services in 
Munich, said the ability to buy and sell in a liquid market means credit 
derivatives offer a flexibility that established tools like credit insurance 
and forfaiting guarantees lack. Credit derivatives were are often cheaper 
than the alternatives, too, he added.

""This is not a trading book thing. For us, the credit default swap is another 
tool for credit risk management,"" Lierow said.

HELPS OPERATIONAL UNITS DO MORE BUSINESS

Siemens Financial Services acts as the centralised risk portfolio management 
operation for companies within the Siemens electronics and industrial group. 
It first started using credit derivatives in July 2000.

Large companies like Siemens can have hundreds of millions of dollars in 
receivables on their books at any time. The efficiency with which these 
companies manage the credit risk on their receivables has an impact on their 
day to day business.

""The advantage for the operative area is that they can offload more 
receivables and do more business,"" Lierow said.

Siemens uses credit default swaps, the most liquid type of credit 
derivatives, to hedge its portfolio of debtors on a constant basis. As the 
balance of cash owed by each name fluctuates over time, the company tries to 
match this with
default swap positions. Hence, if a customer fails to pay, Siemens can recoup 
the debt from the default swap seller.

Other companies use credit derivatives less frequently.

""There are occasional corporate users that have secured one-off requirements 
for balance-sheet management aims or to strip out the credit risk of a 
commercial transaction,"" said Walter Gontarek, head of global credit products 
at RBC Dominion Securities.

By hedging a country or company risk which a corporate may not be comfortable 
in carrying, a credit derivative can facilitate a project that may otherwise 
be unfeasible, dealers said.

NOT PUT OFF BY BAD PRESS

Corporates' adoption of credit derivatives is in spite of the negative 
publicity the instruments have received in recent years. A number of disputes 
over whether protection buyers could force banks to pay up on contracts have 
ended up in court. However, traders insist that subsequent work done on 
contract documentation minimises the risk of such disputes in future. 

Nonetheless a very practical concern for corporates remains, in that credit 
derivatives documentation was designed by bankers with sovereign and 
corporate bonds in mind. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association 
(ISDA)
standard documentation for credit default swaps allows for a pay-out in 
relation to defaults on bond payments but not on a private debtor's failure 
to pay.

""We use the ISDA framework but we need it redrafted in specific ways to fit 
our needs. You cannot take a standard contract and trade on it if you want to 
hedge trade receivables,"" Lierow said. These amendments add to the cost of the
credit derivative.

Another problem that corporates face is the complexity of credit derivatives. 
There is little experience of the instruments, which are barely a decade old, 
in the corporate world. Siemens had to get its expertise from the financial 
markets, hiring Lierow from Bankgesellschaft Berlin.

Clive Banks, UK head of derivatives sales to buy-side clients at Schroder 
Salomon Smith Barney, said much of the effort in marketing credit derivatives 
to corporates involves educating them about the products and the risks 
involved.

""It's about explaining credit risk management and what kind of volatility and 
cost having credit risk introduces,"" he said.

OUTLOOK PROMISING

Yet some corporates are beginning to take full advantage of their new tool. 
Lierow said that Siemens, which currently only buys credit protection, 
planned to start acting as a default swaps seller in the coming months.

He said selling would facilitate better matching of protection levels to 
actual exposures, and would enable diversification of risk away from industry 
sectors where the company's activities are concentrated.

""You could improve the portfolio mix by buying protection on automotives and 
selling protection on pharmaceuticals,"" he said.

Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
HAGRSTOWN, Md. -(Dow Jones)- Allegheny Energy Inc.'s (AYE) Allegheny Energy 
Supply Co. unit purchased 1,710 megawatts of natural gas-fired merchant 
generating capacity in three Midwest states from Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Enron 
North America unit. 
Financial terms weren't disclosed.
In a press release Thursday, Allegheny said it financed the acquisition 
through debt and equity and expects the purchase to add to earnings in 2001, 
excluding transaction costs. 
Allegheny noted that this latest acquisition gives Allegheny Energy Supply 
more than 14,000 MW of total generating capacity that it will own or control 
by 2005. 
Allegheny Energy Global Markets will market output from the three facilities. 
On April 27, Allegheny priced its public offering of 12.4 million shares at 
$48.25 each, and said it would use the $598.3 million in gross proceeds to 
fund its previously reported acquisition of generating facilities located in 
the Midwest and for other corporate purposes. 
New York Stock Exchange-listed shares of Allegheny recently traded at $49.85, 
down 51 cents, or 1%, on composite volume of 306,000 shares. Average daily 
volume is 538,773 shares. 
Allegheny, which posted an operating net of $313.7 million, or $2.84 a share, 
on revenue of $4.01 billion for the year ended Dec. 31, is an energy company.

Allegheny Energy Supply Completes Purchase of Midwest Assets; Adds 1,700 MW 
to Growing Generation Fleet

05/03/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

HAGERSTOWN, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 3, 2001--Allegheny Energy, Inc. (NYSE: 
AYE) today announced that its unregulated generation subsidiary, Allegheny 
Energy Supply Company, LLC, has completed the purchase of 1,710 megawatts of 
natural gas-fired merchant generating capacity in three Midwest states from 
Enron North America, a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE). 
The acquisition gives Allegheny Energy more than 14,000 MW of total 
generating capacity that it will own or control by 2005 and marks a 
significant step in the Company's strategic course toward becoming a national 
energy supplier.
Earlier this year, Allegheny Energy Supply acquired 83 MW of coal-fired 
generation in the Conemaugh Generating Facility near Johnstown, Pa. 
Additionally, the Company has announced plans to build a 1,080-MW natural gas 
combined-cycle plant in La Paz County, Ariz.; a 630-MW natural gas 
combined-cycle facility near South Bend, Ind.; and a 540-MW natural gas fired 
combined-cycle generating facility in Springdale, Pa. Another 220 MW of 
peaking capacity have already been completed in Pennsylvania. 
The Midwest acquisition was financed through a combination of debt and equity 
and will be accretive to Allegheny Energy's earnings in 2001, excluding 
transaction costs and other costs related to the integration. Yesterday, the 
Company issued more than 14 million shares of common stock to facilitate the 
transaction. 
Alan J. Noia, Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer 
of Allegheny Energy, said, ""I am pleased to announce the closing of Allegheny 
Energy's largest generation acquisition to date. It provides our Company with 
significant generation presence and capability as an energy merchant to sell 
electricity from efficient natural gas-fired generation facilities in more 
areas of the country with a growing demand for energy."" 
Output from the three facilities will be marketed by Allegheny Energy Global 
Markets. 
""These premium generating assets are designed for operation in times of peak 
electricity demand,"" said Noia. ""Because of its national presence, Allegheny 
Energy Global Markets will be able to market the output from these newly 
acquired facilities in a wide variety of ways with our portfolio of existing 
assets and other supply arrangements so that overall operational efficiency 
and shareholder value is maximized."" 
Allegheny Energy Supply's newly acquired facilities include: the Gleason, 
Tenn., plant (546 MW), approximately 40 miles north of Jackson, Tenn.; the 
Wheatland, Ind., plant (508 MW), approximately 70 miles northeast of 
Evansville, Ind.; and the Lincoln Energy Center plant (656 MW) in Manhattan, 
Ill., near Chicago. These assets give Allegheny Energy Supply additional 
generating capacity within the East Central Area Reliability region (ECAR) 
and initial generation sources in the Mid-America Interconnected Network 
(MAIN) and the Southeastern Electric Reliability Council (SERC).

SSB Cuts Forecast For Power Profitability In 2002, Beyond

05/03/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Salomon Smith Barney's utility analysts sharply cut 
their forecast of the profitability of generating electricity in the U.S. in 
2002 and beyond because power prices are expected to drop more sharply than 
natural gas prices starting next year. 
The analysts cut the profit margin in natural gas-fired power in 2003 to 
$3.98 a megawatt-hour from $8.73/MWh, a 54% difference from their last 
forecast in February. They lowered their power price index for 2002 by 1.5% 
and for 2003 by 7.1% Thursday in a published report. Their forecast is based 
on forward markets for electricity and gas.
""Gas prices are remaining strong for a much longer period of time, while 
power prices drop off,"" senior electricity industry analyst Raymond Niles 
said in a telephone conference with investors. 
As a result, stock prices for power producers such as AES Corp. (AES), Mirant 
(MIR), Calpine Corp. (CPN) and NRG Energy (NRG) could peak this summer in 
advance of strong third quarter earnings reports, the Salomon report says. 
""Investors may still shy away from asset and investment-heavy power producers 
if realized prices begin to reflect the decreases in power prices now 
projected in the forward curve,"" the report warns. 
After this summer, the stocks of energy companies that focus more on trading 
will regain momentum, Salomon expects. These ""energy merchant"" companies, 
such as Enron Corp. (ENE), Williams Cos. (WMB), Duke Energy (DUK) and Dynegy 
(DYN), should be able to take advantage of higher trading volume and greater 
volatility in power markets in non-summer months, according to Salomon. 
""We expect (annual trading) volumes to grow, industry-wide, between 25% and 
40%, on average, during 2001-03, as the $800 billion global energy commodity 
market continues to open,"" the report predicts. 
The overall electricity price trend is national, according to Salomon. The 
report, titled ""Power Curve,"" expects 2001 wholesale power prices to exceed 
last year's by 131% in the West and by 34% on average in the eastern U.S., 
including Texas. But since their last forecast, the analysts lowered their 
forward price curve for next year and beyond in 10 of 11 regional power 
pools. 
""Interestingly, the exception to that is the New York Power Pool,"" Niles told 
investors. 
For the remainder of this year, however, Salomon still expects power 
producers to beat substantially last year's breakthrough results. 
""About 50% of the spike upward in western U.S. power prices the past six 
months has been from something we've never seen before in this industry: 
political and credit risk,"" Niles said in the conference. 
Western merchant power suppliers are benefitting from the ""unholy mess in 
California,"" Niles said, but that won't last forever. 
""Whenever the debate tapers off and we have a resolution in sight, that 
premium will slowly drain out of the western markets, and bring down 
profitability for the group,"" Niles said. 
National calls for reregulation due to the California crisis could continue 
to hurt stock prices for the entire sector, even though reregulation won't 
happen. Further, in so far as such calls discourage investment in generating 
plants, transmission lines and gas pipelines, they could also extend the 
current period of extremely high earnings, according to the report. 
In non-western states, the greatest profitability from power generation for 
the next two years is seen in New England.

The Rating Outlook for both companies is changed to Stable from Negative. The

long-term business plan. A combination of debt and equity at NBP was used to 
fund the recent acquisitions of Bear Paw, LLC, Midwestern Gas Transmission 
Company, and Dynegy Canada midstream assets. An additional $125-150 million 
of equity is expected to be sold in the coming months to pay down short-term 
debt and complete the permanent financing.
The improvement in Rating Outlook primarily reflects NBP's demonstrated 
commitment to undertake conservative long-term financing and operating 
strategies. Future acquisitions at the partnership level are expected to be 
financed 50/50, debt/equity so as to maintain financial flexibility and a 
stable credit profile. Moreover, management has shown a strong bias to 
minimize commodity price risk as it expands its non-regulated gas operations. 
For example, processing contracts for Bear Paw's four processing facilities 
are contracted for on a percentage of proceeds basis and liquids prices have 
been 90% hedged by NBP through 2001, limiting downside exposure. 
NBPL continues to exhibit strong competitive market, operating, and financial 
characteristics that are consistent with its current `A-` rating. The company 
is a low-cost transporter of Canadian gas into the Midwest, with costs per 
hundred miles of less than 4 cents per mcf. The December 2000 completion of 
the Alliance Pipeline has had minimal impact on Northern Border as capacity 
utilization approaches 100%. Pipeline capacity is 99% subscribed through 
mid-September 2003. Its shippers are financially strong customers with 
uniform take-or-pay contracts. The company has never written off a bad debt. 
NBPL should generate EBITDA/interest coverage of nearly 4.0 times over the 
next few years. 
Credit concerns primarily relate to NBP's changing business mix and the 
expectation of increased market risk associated with its growing midstream 
operations as compared with the stable, low-risk profile of NBPL. While 
projected consolidated and stand alone credit measures at NBP remain 
relatively strong, there will be less predictability in the future cash 
stream utilized to service debt. 
NBP is a publicly traded master limited partnership. Its primary holding is a 
70% economic interest in NBPL, a 1,214-mile FERC regulated interstate 
pipeline transporting natural gas from the Canadian border to the upper 
Midwest. Enron Corp. and The Williams Companies, Inc. hold a 10.0% and 3.3% 
stake in NBP, respectively, with the remainder publicly held. Enron controls 
an 82.5% stake in the management committee of NBP with Williams holding the 
remaining management allocation.

INDIA: UPDATE 1-Enron to meet govt panel over Indian project

05/03/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW DELHI, May 3 (Reuters) - The Indian unit of Enron Corp said on Thursday 
that its officials would meet members of a government panel formed to 
re-negotiate a troubled $2.9 billion power project in western India. 
But the willingness to meet the panel next week should not be construed as an 
offer to renegotiate the contract, Dabhol Power Company (DPC) said in a 
statement.
""As a matter of courtesy we have agreed to meet with them next week,"" the DPC 
statement said. ""Since the purpose of our meeting is to hear out the 
committee and understand their thoughts, we will not present any proposal."" 
DPC said it had constantly maintained that it was open to maintaining a 
dialogue towards resolving issues. 
""(But) This meeting should in no manner be construed as an open offer from 
DPC to renegotiate the terms of the contract,"" it added. 
DPC and the government of the western state of Maharashtra have been locked 
in a payment battle for months, with the state's electricity board balking at 
paying Enron what it considers too high a rate for electricity. 
At present, Maharashtra's State Electricity Board (MSEB) owes the DPC, of 
which Enron is a 65 percent stakeholder, some $48 million for power. 
The Maharashtra government last week announced the formation of a panel of 
experts to re-negotiate its contract with DPC and lower the cost of power 
sold to MSEB. 
LARGEST FOREIGN INVESTMENT 
The Dabhol project, the single largest foreign investment in India, consists 
of two phases, the already-built 740 megawatt power plant and a 1,444 MW 
plant that is expected to be finished this year. 
Last week, Dabhol's board authorised the plant's managing director to issue a 
preliminary notice of termination of service to MSEB. The notice, which has 
not been issued, would be the first step for Enron to pull out of the 
project. 
Earlier, a source familiar with the project told Reuters that Indian lenders, 
who have provided millions of dollars to Houston-based Enron to build DPC are 
lobbying with the government to act quickly and end the crisis. 
""We have asked the government for help. We are awaiting their reply,"" the 
source, who is employed with a large financial institution, said. 
The domestic lenders to the project are Industrial Development Bank of India 
, ICICI Ltd , Industrial Finance Corporation of India , Canara Bank and State 
Bank of India . 
If Enron pulls out of the project, the source said, the lenders would have no 
choice but to seek an alternative buyer. 
""The plant is good, Maharashtra needs power and I am sure buyers can be 
found,"" the source added.

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India's Maharashtra state government's expert 
committee's Saturday meeting with the U.S. energy major Enron Corp.'s (ENE) 
Indian unit Dabhol Power Co. has been postponed until May 11 at the request 
of DPC, a committee member told Dow Jones Newswires late Thursday. 
The nine-member committee has been appointed to renegotiate the Maharashtra 
State Electricity Board's controversial power purchase agreement with DPC. 
The state government has asked the committee to try to negotiate a revised 
agreement within a month.
""The negotiating committee's first meeting with the Dabhol Power Co. 
management scheduled for Saturday has been postponed until May 11, 0530 GMT, 
at DPC's request. They (DPC) told us they wanted some more time to prepare 
themselves for the meeting and we have granted their request,"" said a 
committee member. 
The committee's goals are to lower the power tariff and allow the sale of 
excess power to the federal government or its utilities. A restructure of the 
DPC's stakeholding may also be on the agenda.

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- German wind farm developer EnergieKontor AG said 
Thursday it has signed a framework agreement with Enron Wind GmbH for 
deliveries of wind turbines for projects in Germany and Spain. 
In all, Enron will deliver 200 megawatts' worth of 1.5 MW turbines for 
onshore projects in EnergieKontor's home market and in Spain, one of its 
fastest-growing export markets.
In addition, Neuer Markt-listed EnergieKontor said it has entered into 
exclusive negotiations with the local authorities for permission to build up 
to 15 wind farms at a number of sites in the Castilla-La Mancha region. Each 
site would have an installed capacity of 45-50 MW, making a total of 700 MW. 
""Once we reach this stage there is about an 85-90% of the project going 
ahead, sometimes more,"" a spokesman told Dow Jones. 
EnergieKontor said it assumes that it will set up the first windfarms in 
Castilla-La Mancha as early as next year.

The Bottom Line: Scottish Power Looks To Refine Focus
By Andrea Chipman
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

05/03/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- After more than a year of lagging earnings, investment 
missteps and unexpected disasters, U.K. vertically-integrated utility 
Scottish Power (SPI) is hoping a new strategy to streamline its businesses 
will signal a more focused period for the company. 
But it's got its work cut out. While investors were cheered by news that its 
U.S. Utah-based Hunter power plant is back online after a six-month outage 
that cost the company an estimated $160 million, uncertainty over its plans 
for its Southern Water unit and apparent ongoing commitment to loss-making 
telecoms venture Thus are seen as muddling group focus.
""It all adds up - the lack of coherent strategy, quite substantial downgrades 
and a whole host of non-core businesses that they don't have any natural 
management flair or expertise in,"" said Brian Gallagher, a senior fund 
manager at London-based Gartmore Investment Management, which has GBP3 
million of Scottish Power shares in its Global Utilities Fund. ""We have a 
reasonably low opinion of the company."" 
The company said Thursday that its pretax profit before goodwill amortization 
and exceptional items for the fiscal year ending March 31 fell to GBP628 
million from GBP736 million a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share declined 
to 30.65 pence in the 2001 fiscal year from 41.22 pence in 2000. 
The company acknowledged profits have been hit hard by the Hunter outage, 
competition on wholesale and retail markets in the U.K. and strict price 
controls on its regulated infrastructure businesses. 
Although the company's shares were trading at 458.5 pence after the release 
of Thursday's earnings results, up from 441.5 pence Wednesday, they are down 
more than 15% from 533 pence a year ago. 
Executives say they are restructuring the business into three targeted 
divisions to capitalize on its traditional strengths in generation and power 
supply and infrastructure and to expand its overseas activities. 
""We've now got a trading and commercial link between generation and supply 
and the first thing we are doing is putting emphasis on that...on growing 
earnings across that value chain,"" Scottish Power Chief Executive Ian Russell 
told journalists in a conference call Thursday. ""In the U.S., we are focused 
on cost cutting and on acquiring new businesses."" 
Scottish Power's move away from a full multi-utility profile - begun last 
year with its partial disposal of Thus and its withdrawal from an Internet 
banking venture with the Royal Bank of Scotland - toward a more narrowly 
focused energy business mimics a trend across the industry toward greater 
specialization. 
The company is also considering selling Southern Water, which would allow it 
to focus even more closely on its power business. 
Yet analysts and investors say they are looking for more details of the 
company's overall growth strategy from Russell, who took over as chief 
executive last month, and other managers. The toll from months of drift, is 
evident, they said. 
Sales Of Southern Water, Thus Seen 
Indeed, despite its efforts to chart a new road, Scottish Power appears to be 
reluctant to acknowledge the failure of some of its non-core ventures. 
Russell said his company remains ""supportive"" of Thus, which reported a 2000 
fiscal year loss of GBP21.4 million this week, and has no plans to exit its 
remaining 50% stake in the company. 
Similarly, he said, Scottish Power hasn't yet made a final decision to 
dispose of Southern Water - which has cut costs under its Scottish parent but 
is increasingly unable to cover its capital expenditure - although he said 
the company had received ""a number of offers"" from potential buyers. Although 
he declined to identify any of the bidders, Italian energy company Enel SpA 
(ENI) has confirmed its interest. 
Industry sources said a prompt sale of the water unit looks likely, with some 
bids already exceeding the GBP2 billion at which many analysts value the 
company's combined assets and debt. It's unclear, they said, how Southern 
Water or Thus would fit into Scottish Power's new image. 
""Scottish Power sees itself as an international energy company,"" a source 
familiar with the company said. In a year's time, he added, ""it would be 
unlikely that Southern Water and Thus would be part of the company."" 
Revenues from the sale of the water unit would also help Scottish Power 
pursue its U.S. expansion without adding to its 90% gearing levels, analysts 
and investors said. 
Russell declined to comment on reports Scottish Power is considering buying 
Enron Corp.'s Oregon-based unit, Portland General, but admitted the company 
would be a logical geographical fit with Pacificorp. 
Analysts said Scottish Power's plans for U.S. growth is likely to be a key 
part of its energy strategy. 
""We like their U.S. strategy where they've leveraged expertise gained in the 
highly competitive U.K. market,"" said Gareth Lewis-Davies, head of utilities 
research at Lehman Brothers in London. 
Closer to home, competition and the trend toward increased specialization in 
the power industry may force Scottish Power to determine whether its business 
strength lies in asset management or retail and generation. 
""Strategic decisions need to be made, and I'm not sure if they are going to 
make them in the near term or not,"" said Andrew Wright, U.K. utilities 
analyst at UBS Warburg in London. ""They are pretty much involved across the 
value chain, and I think it remains to be seen which part of the value chain 
they specialize in, if any.""

By MICHAEL LIEDTKE AP Business Writer 05/03/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - There's a limit to how much people will pay for most things in life. If the cost scares off enough buyers, prices eventually fall. So what would happen if this textbook example from Economics 101 were applied to California's electricity crisis? What if the state officials struggling to maintain energy supplies simply refused to buy power above a certain price and accepted more blackouts this summer? The question would have been absurd just a few months ago and even now the notion seems surreal, given the possible consequences. Inviting even more blackouts inevitably would hurt businesses and frustrate consumers, threatening to further depress California's already slumping economy - the sixth largest in the world. But desperate times require drastic measures, according to the economists, lawmakers and activists who believe the state will be better off sitting in the dark than buying electricity at any price during a summer shortage likely to produce recurring blackouts anyway. ""It's better to use (blackouts) and break the (wholesale energy) cartel than simply to suffer them,"" said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumer Action Network, a San Diego watchdog group. Refusing to buy enough power to keep the lights on ""would be like playing with fire,"" counters Wells Fargo & Co. chief economist Sung Won Sohn. ""Blackouts aren't a just matter of inconvenience or being too hot or cold. They cost businesses a lot of money."" Buying electricity at the last minute to meet the state's power needs already has cost the California government $5.7 billion in the past 3 1/2 months. The state energy bill for 2001 could reach $50 billion, in money otherwise spent on education, public safety and health care, Shames said. Faced with the prospect of a significant budget deficit, some lawmakers think it's time for California to take a stand against the power wholesalers - many of whom are based outside the state. This Tuesday, the state Senate Energy Committee will consider authorizing the state to refuse to buy power above certain prices. Current law requires state electricity managers to avoid blackouts by buying all available power at any cost. ""We have been over a barrel in so many ways,"" said Sen. Dede Alpert, D-Coronado, who sponsored SB73x. ""Maybe there's a point in the market where (we) just say no and go with the planned blackout strategy instead."" Economists give the bill little chance of succeeding. ""It's never going to happen. It's not a viable option,"" said University of California at Berkeley Professor Severin Borenstein, one of the energy experts who have studied the idea. The business lost during blackouts would mean more layoffs in a state already skittish over the technology downturn and the looming Hollywood writers strike, economists say. Other ripple effects include diminished gasoline supplies, leading to even higher prices at the pump, and distribution headaches that could leave store shelves bare. And some consumers - the elderly and the infirm, for example, need power at any price. Without electricity, Manteca resident Betty Jarzemkoski said she wouldn't be able to help her ailing husband to get out of his motorized bed at home. ""It would be a real hardship for us,"" said Jarzemkoski, 78. ""I'm on a fixed income so I hope they can figure out something to bring down prices. But we need power."" Despite such concerns, the concept of a buyer's boycott hasn't been flatly ruled out - at least publicly - by Gov. Gray Davis as he struggles to reduce the state's staggering electricity bill. The state is spending as much as $90 million per day to meet California's electricity needs and the bleeding is sure to get worse. When the summer heat increases demand and tightens supplies, California might spend more than $1 billion each week, state officials estimate. Extended blackouts pose an even greater cost, economists say. When Northern California suffered rolling blackouts for several hours Jan. 18-19, the economic losses totaled $2.3 billion, mostly from lost profits and wages, estimated the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp. Multiply that over several weeks across the entire state, and it becomes apparent why it makes more sense for California to continue buying power at inflated prices, even if leaves the state with deep debts and a ruined credit rating, economists argue. As it is, California probably won't be able to round up enough power at any price on some days this summer, making some blackouts a virtual certainty. The blackouts will reduce the state's economic output by $2 billion to $16 billion, according to a study released last month by the Bay Area Economic Forum. The resolve of the state's politicians and ratepayers would be sorely tested for a boycott to succeed, much in the way that labor strikes boil down to whether workers or management can withstand more financial pain. ""Politicians aren't going to willingly turn out the lights because politicians want to get re-elected,"" said Borenstein, director of the University of California's energy institute. ""As soon as people start losing their jobs because the power is off, the public will get tired of the blackouts real quick."" Still, Californians might tolerate an increase in blackouts if they understand why the state chose to pursue such a drastic course, said Stanford economics Professor Frank Wolak, who heads the Independent System Operator's market surveillance committee. ""This isn't something you could do without an enormous public relations campaign,"" he said. ""The campaign would have to explain that the state had no other choice but to do this because (federal power regulators) aren't doing their job and enforcing the law against unjust and unreasonable prices."" The largest out-of-state generators are in such robust financial shape that it might take weeks before they would feel such pain from a California boycott that they would be forced to lower prices. After making record profits last year, power wholesalers Enron, Reliant, Dynegy, Duke Energy, Williams and Mirant and earned a combined $1.6 billion during the first three months of this year. --- On The Net: Bay Area Economic Forum report: http://www.bayareacouncil.org/ppi/enp/enp-mid.html Electric Power Research Institute: http://www.epri.com Utility Consumers' Action Network Report: http://www.ucan.org/cartelrep2.htm INDIA: Indian banks appeal to govt to help end Enron row 05/03/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. BOMBAY, May 3 (Reuters) - Indian lenders to U.S. energy group Enron Corp's gas-fired power plant south of Bombay have appealed to the Indian government to help end the company's row with a state-owned electricity board over pricing and upaid bills. The board of Enron's Indian unit, Dabhol Power Co (DPC) has authorised management to stop selling power to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) if a bitter dispute over pricing and unpaid bills cannot be resolved. In the past half year the MSEB has defaulted on bills for electricity supplied by Dabhol, which operates the world's largest gas-fired plant on the west coast of India, 160 kilometres (100 miles) south of Bombay. Indian financial institutions, which contributed $1.4 billion towards the project in loans, are pressing the government to help end the crisis, a source told Reuters. ""We have asked the government for help. We are awaiting their reply,"" the source, who is employed with a large financial institution, said. The domestic lenders to the project are Industrial Development Bank of India , ICICI Ltd , Industrial Finance Corporation of India , Canara Bank and State Bank of India . The Dabhol Power Company (DPC), owned 65 percent by Enron, last month took the major step of bailing out of the $2.9 billion power project, citing non-payment of bills by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). The DPC board's move sparked widespread fears that India's image as a safe destination for foreign direct investment would be damaged. POWER STRUGGLE MSEB, which is a state-owned utility, has been a regular defaulter on payments to DPC saying that it finds the power too costly. It has also backed out on its commitment to buy more power to be produced by the project's second phase which is to begin operations later this year. Last month MSEB said it had paid Dabhol Power 1.34 billion rupees ($28.60 million) for electricity it bought in March. But the payment only partially resolves the total overdue amount of 2.26 billion rupees ($48.2 million), which Enron has been unable to collect even after invoking guarantees issued by the government of Maharashtra, India's most industrialised state, and the federal government. The state utility still owes Enron payments for power purchases in December and January. The Indian government has maintained that the contract must be renegotiated and has set up a committee to do so. ""We are concerned and would like the renegotiations to happen fast,"" the source added. The dispute has raised fears that Enron could pull the plug on the project, cease providing power to the local state electricity board and perhaps even sell the plant. ""The plant is good, Maharashtra needs power and I am sure buyers can be found,"" the source added. ($1=46.82 Indian rupees). DNC: Special Interests Write Bush Energy Policy 05/03/2001 PR Newswire (Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire) WASHINGTON, May 3 /PRNewswire/ -- The Democratic National Committee issued the following today: Dick Cheney began dropping hints this week as to what the Bush energy policy will look like, and it is long on oil and short on conservation. But something was missing from the coverage of Cheney's announcement: not just who benefits from the Bush plan, but who's writing it as well. (Photo: http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20000107/DCF015 ) It's hard to understate the influence big donors and high-ranking executives have with the Bush Administration. Take Tom Kuhn, for example, one of the energy executives who came calling when Bush was thinking about actually following through on his pledge to limit carbon dioxide levels. Kuhn, a top Bush fundraiser, also served on Bush's Energy Department transition advisory team, and still enjoys access to the highest reaches of the Bush White House. Not surprisingly then, the Big Oil Bush Administration's energy policy could not make Bush's huge donors and the special interests in the energy business any happier. Since the energy industry's problems are Bush's problems, the first things on Bush's hit list are the environmental regulations that keep Big Energy in check -- and our country clean. With an energy executive running around the West Wing, Bush's energy policy could be summed up as, ""Drill anywhere, anytime, and keep those checks coming."" The Democratic Party is committed to fighting for a balanced energy policy that keeps our country's priorities -- such as a clean environment -- in mind. To learn more about Bush's misplaced priorities and kowtows to the special interests, keep reading to find out the ""Top Ten Paybacks To The Energy Industry,"" and to see how you, too, can get on the Bush gravy train in ""Recipe for a Quid Pro Quo,"" courtesy of the Democratic Party's http://www.100DaysofBush.com. BUSH'S TOP TEN PAYBACKS TO THE ENERGY INDUSTRY One of the most obvious and recurring themes of Bush's first 100 days has been the extraordinary influence the oil and gas industry has had in the new administration. Oil and gas interests are some of Bush's top campaign contributors, giving more than $3 million to get Bush elected. In exchange, Bush has rolled back regulations issued by the Clinton administration on such things as air conditioner efficiency, as well as breaking his campaign promise to regulate carbon dioxide emissions. Bush has proposed drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and national monuments. Bush has taken a backseat when it comes to the energy crisis California is experiencing, while cutting funding for energy conservation programs. He has also repaid top donors, lobbyists and industry officials with key positions throughout his administration. Here is just a sampling of how the oil, gas and other energy industries have benefited in Bush's first 100 days: 2 - BUSH TAKES HANDS-OFF APPROACH TO CALIFORNIA CRISIS WHILE ENERGY COMPANIES MAKE MILLIONS Bush Did Little to Aid California in Energy Crisis; Fleischer Said Crisis is a ""California Matter."" Bush has done little to aid California in its energy crisis, such as refusing to support wholesale price caps on electricity. White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said, ""The president continues to believe that the issue is mostly a California matter, dealing with the legislation that is before the state. And the leaders of California are working to address that in their own right."" Fleischer also said that Bush wanted to focus on a ""long term"" national energy policy. (AAP Newsfeed, 1/23/01; Wall Street Journal, 1/23/01) Texas Energy Company Accused of Price Gouging to Make Money off California's Energy Crisis. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered further inquiry into allegations by California officials that El Paso Natural Gas Co., a Houston based subsidiary of El Paso Energy Co., manipulated the natural gas market by keeping supply artificially low, contributing to the high price of electricity in the state. El Paso Energy was one of the Texas firms ""grandfathered"" by Bush's voluntary emissions standards in Texas. Between 1993 and 1998, El Paso Energy and El Paso Natural Gas PACs gave a total of $8,000 to Bush's gubernatorial campaigns. During the 1999-2000 election cycle, El Paso Energy Corp. and El Paso Natural Gas Co. gave a total of $743,029 to Bush and the GOP -- $460,395 to GOP in soft money, $247,750 to GOP candidates from its PAC, and $34,884 to the Bush campaign from its employees and executives.

LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - British utility Innogy said on Thursday it had started trading wholesale electricity on the French-Italian border and was set to enter the German power market. ""We have done some wholesale trading on the Italy-France border, moving power from France to Italy, and we are very close to doing some in Germany,"" said director of trading Tony West in an interview with Reuters. ""This year we will significantly increase our trading in (mainland) Europe; we are discussing relationships with counterparties at the moment,"" he added. Innogy is building a European power trading team at its headquarters in Swindon, southern England, from where it already trades the UK gas and power markets. FRANCE COULD BE KEY MARKET West said the company initially had expected the main focus of its European trading strategy to be Germany and the north west of the continent. But the early signs were that France would also play a key role, particularly as Innogy had gained access to capacity in the UK-France undersea interconnector cable. ""France has taken me by surprise. It might be more important than we anticipated although there are clearly still issues about the speed of liberalisation,"" said West. A core of about eight companies regularly trade power in France, including TXU Europe, Enron and a trading alliance between Endesa and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, according to traders. West said Innogy had so far concentrated on buying power in France, not always from French companies, and taking it to Italy via the cross border interconnector between the two countries. Innogy had bought some of the 400-megawatts available on the interconnector through recent auctions, he said. ""It's easy to trade through France, the cost of taking power through to the border is minuscule, although buying power in France and then selling it in France is a lot more difficult,"" said West. He said Innogy had signed grid balancing agreements with French transmission grid operator RTE. Andy Duff, managing director of generation and trading, added France could become become important for Innogy on a retail level, as well as a trading level, depending on how effectively the UK-France interconnector could be used. ""The European market will be driven by the operation of interconnectors and transmission services as well as exchanges,"" said Duff. Innogy may look to trade on Germany's two power exchanges as well as that country's burgeoning over-the-counter market. The company is in the process of signing standard trading agreements for Germany based on the terms devised by the industry group the European Federation of Energy Traders (EFET). FOCUS ON TRADING, NOT ASSETS Duff said Innogy's strategy in Europe was to focus on trading but not the acquisition of physical assets. ""We are not going to lead with assets in Europe. We will focus on trading services-type arrangements, extracting value from (other companies') assets. That's the main thrust of the business,"" he said. West said Innogy's trading in mainland Europe would expand into natural gas as opportunities emerged. The company already trades around the UK-Belgium gas interconnector. Mosaic Group posts strong first quarter results 05/03/2001 Canada NewsWire (Copyright Canada NewsWire 2001) -- Diluted Cash Earnings per Share Increases by 29% and Revenues up by 89% -- TORONTO, May 3 /CNW/ - Mosaic Group Inc. (MGX:TSE), Canada's leading outsourced marketing services agency, announced today that it continued its trend of strong earnings growth for the period ending March 31, 2001. Posting its 18th consecutive quarter of year over year revenue growth, Mosaic has also reported an average quarterly organic growth rate of 27% since 1996. Financial highlights from continuing operations(x) for this quarter include: - Revenues at $171.8 million - up 89% or $80.7 million from Q1 2000. ""Mosaic has consistently outpaced the growth of its peers within an industry that is clearly expanding,"" said Mike Preston, Chairman and CEO Mosaic Group Inc. ""We have posted 18 consecutive quarters of continued growth while adding to our blue chip client list. We are building our business by taking our clients' business farther every time we deal with them. Our organic growth comes not only from securing new client wins, but from the cross-selling wins that are characteristic of a mature company able to leverage a robust and diverse range of service offerings."" New Client Wins In the first quarter of 2001, Mosaic's newly acquired business unit Paradigm, has secured new client business worth between $20 million and $25 million a year in revenue. Combined with new client wins from Mosaic's other business units, and increases in spending from some existing clients, Mosaic has made significant progress in closing its new business gap for 2001. New Power --------- During the first quarter of 2001, Paradigm signed a contract with New Power to acquire residential and commercial customers through a variety of direct response channels such as outbound telemarketing, inbound telemarketing, direct mail and ""feet on the street"". New Power was formed by Enron Corp., the largest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas in North America. Paradigm had previously provided contract marketing services to New Power. Through diligent effort, Paradigm was able to expand the contract to include the performance-based customer acquisition component. /For further information: Please Contact: Clint Becker, Chief Financial Officer, Mosaic Group Inc., (416) 813-4275, email: beckerc(at)mosaicgroupinc.com; Donna Cox-Davies, Director of Communications, Mosaic Group Inc., (416) 813-4279, Email: cox-daviesd(at)mosaicgroupinc.com/ 16:10 ET European Phone Companies' Outlook Brightens: Rates of Return 2001-05-03 08:52 (New York) European Phone Companies' Outlook Brightens: Rates of Return London, May 3 (Bloomberg) -- European telephone companies such as British Telecommunications Plc and Deutsche Telekom AG have improved their ability to pay back debt in recent weeks, making their bonds a buy, investors said. ``Sentiment seems to be changing,'' said Anna Lees-Jones, who helps manage about 28 billion pounds ($40 billion) of corporate bonds at M&G Investment Management. ``I've been building up my telecoms position all year.'' British Telecom's 10-year euro-denominated bonds sold in January yield about 214 basis points more than government debt, down from a record 238 in March. Contracts that pay out if the company goes bankrupt have also fallen in the past month, according to Enron Corp., which trades the derivatives. Bond yields and bankruptcy derivatives have also declined for Deutsche Telekom and Royal KPN NV, after the companies said they would sell assets to pay down debt that has pushed their credit ratings to record lows and weighed on their shares. Phone companies sold $100 billion of bonds last year to finance licenses and equipment for new mobile services. British Telecom said yesterday it will sell its stakes in Japan Telecom Co. and Spain's Airtel SA to Vodafone Group for 4.8 billion pounds. British Telecom may also sell as much as 7.5 billion pounds of shares to existing investors in a so-called rights offer, according to Legal & General Group Plc, one of the company's shareholders. Deutsche Telekom will sell assets such as cable television, and a stake in Global One and Wind SpA, Chief Financial Officer Karl-Gerhard Eick said last week. KPN, the biggest Dutch phone company, said on March 26 it plans to raise at least 5 billion euros from asset sales to lower debt. Those plans have helped shift investors' perceptions of the companies' creditworthiness, money managers said. `Drastic Measures' ``At the beginning of the year the market was assuming telecoms companies would be downgraded from single-A to triple- B,'' said Peter Harvey, who helps run about $8.6 billion at F&C Management. ``Drastic measures such as deeply-discounted rights issues led investors to believe they will maintain their single-A status.'' The gap, or spread, between British Telecom's sterling denominated bonds maturing in 2006, and U.K. five-year government bonds has narrowed 50 basis points to 109 basis points in the past month. Spreads between Deutsche Telekom's 6.125 percent five- year euro bonds and German government debt narrowed 35 basis points to 107 in April. Bankruptcy Swaps Fall Those shifts in sentiment are also reflected in Enron's bankruptcy swaps, where prices have fallen in the past month, said Simon Brooks, a trader at Enron. Enron prices the swaps using indexes that measure the probability of bankruptcy and the likely recovery rate in that event. The price is expressed as a percentage above a benchmark interest rate such as the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. British Telecom bankruptcy swaps have declined to 66 basis points from 96 on April 1, Enron said. Bankruptcy swaps on Deutsche Telekom dropped to 78 from 100, while KPN's fell to 135 from 183. Over the same period, France Telecom SA's declined to 70 from 100 and Telecom Italia SpA's fell to 94 from 119. British Telecom's bond yields may fall further relative to government debt, analysts said. They still offer higher yields than those of rival Vodafone Group Plc, which has the same ratings though with a stable outlook. While both companies have five-year euro-denominated bonds, British Telecom's offer 55 basis points more yield. The rivals also both have bonds maturing in 2004, and Vodafone's yield about 23 basis points fewer. ``If BT retains their rating, their spreads should be probably 20 to 30 basis points narrower,'' said Brian Venables, head of credit strategy at WestLB. ``Even though it has performed extremely well this year, there is much greater potential for BT's debt.'' Debt Reduction Target Both Moody's Investors Service, which rates British Telecom ``A2'', and Standard & Poor's, which rates it ``A'', have those ratings on watch for further cuts after trimming them four rungs last year. The company's asset sales to Vodafone are ``definitely positive in terms of the rating assessment,'' said Aidan Fisher, who rates British Telecom for Moody's. In combination with the proceeds of a rights sale, ``that would meet the target they set themselves this year -- that's quite a lot to achieve in a 12 month period.'' British Telecom has said it wants to slash its 30 billion pounds of debt by a third and fend off further rating cuts. Before companies such as British Telecom clarified their debt-reduction plans, ``the world and his wife were underweight'' telecom bonds in March, said Harvey at F&C. The investment firm has since raised its holding of telecom bonds to neutral, from underweight, relative to its benchmark, he said. Bond yields ``were trading very much out of line to the rest of the market,'' said Lees-Jones at M&G. Now, ``they have come in quite a bit and will come in further.'' --Tom Kohn and Alice James in the London newsroom (44-20) 7330 7929 or at tkohn@bloomberg.net, with reporting by Christine Harper /zls Story illustration: {CRED <GO>} to see credit analysis on Bloomberg. {BRITEL <Corp> <GO>} for BT's bonds. {DT <Corp> <GO>} for Deutsche Telekom's bonds. UK:Corporates warm to charms of credit derivatives By Tom Bergin 05/03/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - European corporates are beginning to turn to credit derivatives, among the more esoteric and complex of financial instruments, to hedge the risk their debtors won't pay up, market participants said on Thursday. Credit derivatives are insurance-like tools that allow users to hedge the risk of default on a debt. They are mainly used by banks, hedge funds and insurance companies to hedge or gain exposure to the risk of a bond issuer defaulting. Dealers said an environment of deteriorating credit quality and a growing awareness among corporates that credit derivatives offer certain advantages over established hedging tools was behind the increasing use of the instruments. The market remains small, with only around a dozen non-financial European corporates regularly using credit derivatives to manage their credit portfolio at present. But market professionals predict they will one day become as commonplace in the corporate world as other hedging tools such as interest rate swaps and currency options. ""We see (corporate use) as a big growth area for credit derivatives, maybe the biggest,"" says Bryan Seyfried, vice-president of Enron Credit in London. Enron Credit grew out of the efforts of energy company Enron Corp. to hedge its own credit risk portfolio and now specialises in marketing credit risk management solutions to other non-financial corporates. Ralf Lierow, director of credit derivatives at Siemens Financial Services in Munich, said the ability to buy and sell in a liquid market means credit derivatives offer a flexibility that established tools like credit insurance and forfaiting guarantees lack. Credit derivatives were are often cheaper than the alternatives, too, he added. ""This is not a trading book thing. For us, the credit default swap is another tool for credit risk management,"" Lierow said. HELPS OPERATIONAL UNITS DO MORE BUSINESS Siemens Financial Services acts as the centralised risk portfolio management operation for companies within the Siemens electronics and industrial group. It first started using credit derivatives in July 2000. Large companies like Siemens can have hundreds of millions of dollars in receivables on their books at any time. The efficiency with which these companies manage the credit risk on their receivables has an impact on their day to day business. ""The advantage for the operative area is that they can offload more receivables and do more business,"" Lierow said. Siemens uses credit default swaps, the most liquid type of credit derivatives, to hedge its portfolio of debtors on a constant basis. As the balance of cash owed by each name fluctuates over time, the company tries to match this with default swap positions. Hence, if a customer fails to pay, Siemens can recoup the debt from the default swap seller. Other companies use credit derivatives less frequently. ""There are occasional corporate users that have secured one-off requirements for balance-sheet management aims or to strip out the credit risk of a commercial transaction,"" said Walter Gontarek, head of global credit products at RBC Dominion Securities. By hedging a country or company risk which a corporate may not be comfortable in carrying, a credit derivative can facilitate a project that may otherwise be unfeasible, dealers said. NOT PUT OFF BY BAD PRESS Corporates' adoption of credit derivatives is in spite of the negative publicity the instruments have received in recent years. A number of disputes over whether protection buyers could force banks to pay up on contracts have ended up in court. However, traders insist that subsequent work done on contract documentation minimises the risk of such disputes in future. Nonetheless a very practical concern for corporates remains, in that credit derivatives documentation was designed by bankers with sovereign and corporate bonds in mind. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) standard documentation for credit default swaps allows for a pay-out in relation to defaults on bond payments but not on a private debtor's failure to pay. ""We use the ISDA framework but we need it redrafted in specific ways to fit our needs. You cannot take a standard contract and trade on it if you want to hedge trade receivables,"" Lierow said. These amendments add to the cost of the credit derivative. Another problem that corporates face is the complexity of credit derivatives. There is little experience of the instruments, which are barely a decade old, in the corporate world. Siemens had to get its expertise from the financial markets, hiring Lierow from Bankgesellschaft Berlin. Clive Banks, UK head of derivatives sales to buy-side clients at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, said much of the effort in marketing credit derivatives to corporates involves educating them about the products and the risks involved. ""It's about explaining credit risk management and what kind of volatility and cost having credit risk introduces,"" he said. OUTLOOK PROMISING Yet some corporates are beginning to take full advantage of their new tool. Lierow said that Siemens, which currently only buys credit protection, planned to start acting as a default swaps seller in the coming months. He said selling would facilitate better matching of protection levels to actual exposures, and would enable diversification of risk away from industry sectors where the company's activities are concentrated. ""You could improve the portfolio mix by buying protection on automotives and selling protection on pharmaceuticals,"" he said. Allegheny Energy buys three power plants 05/03/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. HAGERSTOWN, Md. (AP) - Allegheny Energy Inc. said Thursday it has purchased three power plants from Houston-based Enron Corp. The company said it issued more than 14 million shares of common stock worth $667 million to pay for the transaction. The plants are in Tennessee, Indiana and Illinois. The Midwestern purchase will bring an additional 1,710 megawatts on line. The company is expected to own 14,000 megawatts of generating power by 2005. Allegheny also has plans to build natural gas-fired facilities in Arizona, Indiana and Pennsylvania. Allegheny Energy is the parent of Allegheny Power, which supplies electricity and natural gas to 3 million people in Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. Allegheny Energy Buys Midwest Capacity From Enron Unit 05/03/2001 Dow Jones News Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) HAGRSTOWN, Md. -(Dow Jones)- Allegheny Energy Inc.'s (AYE) Allegheny Energy Supply Co. unit purchased 1,710 megawatts of natural gas-fired merchant generating capacity in three Midwest states from Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Enron North America unit. Financial terms weren't disclosed. In a press release Thursday, Allegheny said it financed the acquisition through debt and equity and expects the purchase to add to earnings in 2001, excluding transaction costs. Allegheny noted that this latest acquisition gives Allegheny Energy Supply more than 14,000 MW of total generating capacity that it will own or control by 2005. Allegheny Energy Global Markets will market output from the three facilities. On April 27, Allegheny priced its public offering of 12.4 million shares at $48.25 each, and said it would use the $598.3 million in gross proceeds to fund its previously reported acquisition of generating facilities located in the Midwest and for other corporate purposes. New York Stock Exchange-listed shares of Allegheny recently traded at $49.85, down 51 cents, or 1%, on composite volume of 306,000 shares. Average daily volume is 538,773 shares. Allegheny, which posted an operating net of $313.7 million, or $2.84 a share, on revenue of $4.01 billion for the year ended Dec. 31, is an energy company.

Chow; Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5400 Allegheny Energy Supply Completes Purchase of Midwest Assets; Adds 1,700 MW to Growing Generation Fleet 05/03/2001 Business Wire (Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire) HAGERSTOWN, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 3, 2001--Allegheny Energy, Inc. (NYSE: AYE) today announced that its unregulated generation subsidiary, Allegheny Energy Supply Company, LLC, has completed the purchase of 1,710 megawatts of natural gas-fired merchant generating capacity in three Midwest states from Enron North America, a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE). The acquisition gives Allegheny Energy more than 14,000 MW of total generating capacity that it will own or control by 2005 and marks a significant step in the Company's strategic course toward becoming a national energy supplier. Earlier this year, Allegheny Energy Supply acquired 83 MW of coal-fired generation in the Conemaugh Generating Facility near Johnstown, Pa. Additionally, the Company has announced plans to build a 1,080-MW natural gas combined-cycle plant in La Paz County, Ariz.; a 630-MW natural gas combined-cycle facility near South Bend, Ind.; and a 540-MW natural gas fired combined-cycle generating facility in Springdale, Pa. Another 220 MW of peaking capacity have already been completed in Pennsylvania. The Midwest acquisition was financed through a combination of debt and equity and will be accretive to Allegheny Energy's earnings in 2001, excluding transaction costs and other costs related to the integration. Yesterday, the Company issued more than 14 million shares of common stock to facilitate the transaction. Alan J. Noia, Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Allegheny Energy, said, ""I am pleased to announce the closing of Allegheny Energy's largest generation acquisition to date. It provides our Company with significant generation presence and capability as an energy merchant to sell electricity from efficient natural gas-fired generation facilities in more areas of the country with a growing demand for energy."" Output from the three facilities will be marketed by Allegheny Energy Global Markets. ""These premium generating assets are designed for operation in times of peak electricity demand,"" said Noia. ""Because of its national presence, Allegheny Energy Global Markets will be able to market the output from these newly acquired facilities in a wide variety of ways with our portfolio of existing assets and other supply arrangements so that overall operational efficiency and shareholder value is maximized."" Allegheny Energy Supply's newly acquired facilities include: the Gleason, Tenn., plant (546 MW), approximately 40 miles north of Jackson, Tenn.; the Wheatland, Ind., plant (508 MW), approximately 70 miles northeast of Evansville, Ind.; and the Lincoln Energy Center plant (656 MW) in Manhattan, Ill., near Chicago. These assets give Allegheny Energy Supply additional generating capacity within the East Central Area Reliability region (ECAR) and initial generation sources in the Mid-America Interconnected Network (MAIN) and the Southeastern Electric Reliability Council (SERC). Salomon Smith Barney acted as financial advisor and Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue acted as legal counsel for Allegheny Energy for the acquisition.

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Salomon Smith Barney's utility analysts sharply cut their forecast of the profitability of generating electricity in the U.S. in 2002 and beyond because power prices are expected to drop more sharply than natural gas prices starting next year. The analysts cut the profit margin in natural gas-fired power in 2003 to $3.98 a megawatt-hour from $8.73/MWh, a 54% difference from their last forecast in February. They lowered their power price index for 2002 by 1.5% and for 2003 by 7.1% Thursday in a published report. Their forecast is based on forward markets for electricity and gas. ""Gas prices are remaining strong for a much longer period of time, while power prices drop off,"" senior electricity industry analyst Raymond Niles said in a telephone conference with investors. As a result, stock prices for power producers such as AES Corp. (AES), Mirant (MIR), Calpine Corp. (CPN) and NRG Energy (NRG) could peak this summer in advance of strong third quarter earnings reports, the Salomon report says. ""Investors may still shy away from asset and investment-heavy power producers if realized prices begin to reflect the decreases in power prices now projected in the forward curve,"" the report warns. After this summer, the stocks of energy companies that focus more on trading will regain momentum, Salomon expects. These ""energy merchant"" companies, such as Enron Corp. (ENE), Williams Cos. (WMB), Duke Energy (DUK) and Dynegy (DYN), should be able to take advantage of higher trading volume and greater volatility in power markets in non-summer months, according to Salomon. ""We expect (annual trading) volumes to grow, industry-wide, between 25% and 40%, on average, during 2001-03, as the $800 billion global energy commodity market continues to open,"" the report predicts. The overall electricity price trend is national, according to Salomon. The report, titled ""Power Curve,"" expects 2001 wholesale power prices to exceed last year's by 131% in the West and by 34% on average in the eastern U.S., including Texas. But since their last forecast, the analysts lowered their forward price curve for next year and beyond in 10 of 11 regional power pools. ""Interestingly, the exception to that is the New York Power Pool,"" Niles told investors. For the remainder of this year, however, Salomon still expects power producers to beat substantially last year's breakthrough results. ""About 50% of the spike upward in western U.S. power prices the past six months has been from something we've never seen before in this industry: political and credit risk,"" Niles said in the conference. Western merchant power suppliers are benefitting from the ""unholy mess in California,"" Niles said, but that won't last forever. ""Whenever the debate tapers off and we have a resolution in sight, that premium will slowly drain out of the western markets, and bring down profitability for the group,"" Niles said. National calls for reregulation due to the California crisis could continue to hurt stock prices for the entire sector, even though reregulation won't happen. Further, in so far as such calls discourage investment in generating plants, transmission lines and gas pipelines, they could also extend the current period of extremely high earnings, according to the report. In non-western states, the greatest profitability from power generation for the next two years is seen in New England. -By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.com Fitch Affs Northern Border; Rtg Outlook To Stable From Negative 05/03/2001 Business Wire (Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire) NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 3, 2001--Fitch has affirmed its `BBB+' senior debt rating for Northern Border Partners, L.P. (NBP) and its `A-` senior debt rating for its regulated pipeline affiliate Northern Border Pipeline Co. (NBPL). The Rating Outlook for both companies is changed to Stable from Negative. The rating action was taken after a review of NBP's recent acquisitions and long-term business plan. A combination of debt and equity at NBP was used to fund the recent acquisitions of Bear Paw, LLC, Midwestern Gas Transmission Company, and Dynegy Canada midstream assets. An additional $125-150 million of equity is expected to be sold in the coming months to pay down short-term debt and complete the permanent financing. The improvement in Rating Outlook primarily reflects NBP's demonstrated commitment to undertake conservative long-term financing and operating strategies. Future acquisitions at the partnership level are expected to be financed 50/50, debt/equity so as to maintain financial flexibility and a stable credit profile. Moreover, management has shown a strong bias to minimize commodity price risk as it expands its non-regulated gas operations. For example, processing contracts for Bear Paw's four processing facilities are contracted for on a percentage of proceeds basis and liquids prices have been 90% hedged by NBP through 2001, limiting downside exposure. NBPL continues to exhibit strong competitive market, operating, and financial characteristics that are consistent with its current `A-` rating. The company is a low-cost transporter of Canadian gas into the Midwest, with costs per hundred miles of less than 4 cents per mcf. The December 2000 completion of the Alliance Pipeline has had minimal impact on Northern Border as capacity utilization approaches 100%. Pipeline capacity is 99% subscribed through mid-September 2003. Its shippers are financially strong customers with uniform take-or-pay contracts. The company has never written off a bad debt. NBPL should generate EBITDA/interest coverage of nearly 4.0 times over the next few years. Credit concerns primarily relate to NBP's changing business mix and the expectation of increased market risk associated with its growing midstream operations as compared with the stable, low-risk profile of NBPL. While projected consolidated and stand alone credit measures at NBP remain relatively strong, there will be less predictability in the future cash stream utilized to service debt. NBP is a publicly traded master limited partnership. Its primary holding is a 70% economic interest in NBPL, a 1,214-mile FERC regulated interstate pipeline transporting natural gas from the Canadian border to the upper Midwest. Enron Corp. and The Williams Companies, Inc. hold a 10.0% and 3.3% stake in NBP, respectively, with the remainder publicly held. Enron controls an 82.5% stake in the management committee of NBP with Williams holding the remaining management allocation.

NEW DELHI, May 3 (Reuters) - The Indian unit of Enron Corp said on Thursday that its officials would meet members of a government panel formed to re-negotiate a troubled $2.9 billion power project in western India. But the willingness to meet the panel next week should not be construed as an offer to renegotiate the contract, Dabhol Power Company (DPC) said in a statement. ""As a matter of courtesy we have agreed to meet with them next week,"" the DPC statement said. ""Since the purpose of our meeting is to hear out the committee and understand their thoughts, we will not present any proposal."" DPC said it had constantly maintained that it was open to maintaining a dialogue towards resolving issues. ""(But) This meeting should in no manner be construed as an open offer from DPC to renegotiate the terms of the contract,"" it added. DPC and the government of the western state of Maharashtra have been locked in a payment battle for months, with the state's electricity board balking at paying Enron what it considers too high a rate for electricity. At present, Maharashtra's State Electricity Board (MSEB) owes the DPC, of which Enron is a 65 percent stakeholder, some $48 million for power. The Maharashtra government last week announced the formation of a panel of experts to re-negotiate its contract with DPC and lower the cost of power sold to MSEB. LARGEST FOREIGN INVESTMENT The Dabhol project, the single largest foreign investment in India, consists of two phases, the already-built 740 megawatt power plant and a 1,444 MW plant that is expected to be finished this year. Last week, Dabhol's board authorised the plant's managing director to issue a preliminary notice of termination of service to MSEB. The notice, which has not been issued, would be the first step for Enron to pull out of the project. Earlier, a source familiar with the project told Reuters that Indian lenders, who have provided millions of dollars to Houston-based Enron to build DPC are lobbying with the government to act quickly and end the crisis. ""We have asked the government for help. We are awaiting their reply,"" the source, who is employed with a large financial institution, said. The domestic lenders to the project are Industrial Development Bank of India , ICICI Ltd , Industrial Finance Corporation of India , Canara Bank and State Bank of India . If Enron pulls out of the project, the source said, the lenders would have no choice but to seek an alternative buyer. ""The plant is good, Maharashtra needs power and I am sure buyers can be found,"" the source added.

The nine-member committee has been appointed to renegotiate the Maharashtra State Electricity Board's controversial power purchase agreement with DPC. The state government has asked the committee to try to negotiate a revised agreement within a month. ""The negotiating committee's first meeting with the Dabhol Power Co. management scheduled for Saturday has been postponed until May 11, 0530 GMT, at DPC's request. They (DPC) told us they wanted some more time to prepare themselves for the meeting and we have granted their request,"" said a committee member. The committee's goals are to lower the power tariff and allow the sale of excess power to the federal government or its utilities. A restructure of the DPC's stakeholding may also be on the agenda. -By Himendra Kumar, Dow Jones Newswires; 91-11-461-9427; himendra.kumar@dowjones.com EnergieKontor Secures Enron Deal For Spain, Germany Projs 05/03/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) LONDON -(Dow Jones)- German wind farm developer EnergieKontor AG said Thursday it has signed a framework agreement with Enron Wind GmbH for deliveries of wind turbines for projects in Germany and Spain. In all, Enron will deliver 200 megawatts' worth of 1.5 MW turbines for onshore projects in EnergieKontor's home market and in Spain, one of its fastest-growing export markets. In addition, Neuer Markt-listed EnergieKontor said it has entered into exclusive negotiations with the local authorities for permission to build up to 15 wind farms at a number of sites in the Castilla-La Mancha region. Each site would have an installed capacity of 45-50 MW, making a total of 700 MW. ""Once we reach this stage there is about an 85-90% of the project going ahead, sometimes more,"" a spokesman told Dow Jones. EnergieKontor said it assumes that it will set up the first windfarms in Castilla-La Mancha as early as next year. -By Geoffrey T. Smith, Dow Jones Newswires; (+44 20) 7842 9260; -geoffrey.smith@dowjones.com The Bottom Line: Scottish Power Looks To Refine Focus By Andrea Chipman Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 05/03/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) LONDON -(Dow Jones)- After more than a year of lagging earnings, investment missteps and unexpected disasters, U.K. vertically-integrated utility Scottish Power (SPI) is hoping a new strategy to streamline its businesses will signal a more focused period for the company. But it's got its work cut out. While investors were cheered by news that its U.S. Utah-based Hunter power plant is back online after a six-month outage that cost the company an estimated $160 million, uncertainty over its plans for its Southern Water unit and apparent ongoing commitment to loss-making telecoms venture Thus are seen as muddling group focus. ""It all adds up - the lack of coherent strategy, quite substantial downgrades and a whole host of non-core businesses that they don't have any natural management flair or expertise in,"" said Brian Gallagher, a senior fund manager at London-based Gartmore Investment Management, which has GBP3 million of Scottish Power shares in its Global Utilities Fund. ""We have a reasonably low opinion of the company."" The company said Thursday that its pretax profit before goodwill amortization and exceptional items for the fiscal year ending March 31 fell to GBP628 million from GBP736 million a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share declined to 30.65 pence in the 2001 fiscal year from 41.22 pence in 2000. The company acknowledged profits have been hit hard by the Hunter outage, competition on wholesale and retail markets in the U.K. and strict price controls on its regulated infrastructure businesses. Although the company's shares were trading at 458.5 pence after the release of Thursday's earnings results, up from 441.5 pence Wednesday, they are down more than 15% from 533 pence a year ago. Executives say they are restructuring the business into three targeted divisions to capitalize on its traditional strengths in generation and power supply and infrastructure and to expand its overseas activities. ""We've now got a trading and commercial link between generation and supply and the first thing we are doing is putting emphasis on that...on growing earnings across that value chain,"" Scottish Power Chief Executive Ian Russell told journalists in a conference call Thursday. ""In the U.S., we are focused on cost cutting and on acquiring new businesses."" Scottish Power's move away from a full multi-utility profile - begun last year with its partial disposal of Thus and its withdrawal from an Internet banking venture with the Royal Bank of Scotland - toward a more narrowly focused energy business mimics a trend across the industry toward greater specialization. The company is also considering selling Southern Water, which would allow it to focus even more closely on its power business. Yet analysts and investors say they are looking for more details of the company's overall growth strategy from Russell, who took over as chief executive last month, and other managers. The toll from months of drift, is evident, they said. Sales Of Southern Water, Thus Seen Indeed, despite its efforts to chart a new road, Scottish Power appears to be reluctant to acknowledge the failure of some of its non-core ventures. Russell said his company remains ""supportive"" of Thus, which reported a 2000 fiscal year loss of GBP21.4 million this week, and has no plans to exit its remaining 50% stake in the company. Similarly, he said, Scottish Power hasn't yet made a final decision to dispose of Southern Water - which has cut costs under its Scottish parent but is increasingly unable to cover its capital expenditure - although he said the company had received ""a number of offers"" from potential buyers. Although he declined to identify any of the bidders, Italian energy company Enel SpA (ENI) has confirmed its interest. Industry sources said a prompt sale of the water unit looks likely, with some bids already exceeding the GBP2 billion at which many analysts value the company's combined assets and debt. It's unclear, they said, how Southern Water or Thus would fit into Scottish Power's new image. ""Scottish Power sees itself as an international energy company,"" a source familiar with the company said. In a year's time, he added, ""it would be unlikely that Southern Water and Thus would be part of the company."" Revenues from the sale of the water unit would also help Scottish Power pursue its U.S. expansion without adding to its 90% gearing levels, analysts and investors said. Russell declined to comment on reports Scottish Power is considering buying Enron Corp.'s Oregon-based unit, Portland General, but admitted the company would be a logical geographical fit with Pacificorp. Analysts said Scottish Power's plans for U.S. growth is likely to be a key part of its energy strategy. ""We like their U.S. strategy where they've leveraged expertise gained in the highly competitive U.K. market,"" said Gareth Lewis-Davies, head of utilities research at Lehman Brothers in London. Closer to home, competition and the trend toward increased specialization in the power industry may force Scottish Power to determine whether its business strength lies in asset management or retail and generation. ""Strategic decisions need to be made, and I'm not sure if they are going to make them in the near term or not,"" said Andrew Wright, U.K. utilities analyst at UBS Warburg in London. ""They are pretty much involved across the value chain, and I think it remains to be seen which part of the value chain they specialize in, if any.""

Most of West in the Same Power Jam as California
 Utilities: Other states ran their grids at fever pitches as populations 
swelled and few new energy sources were developed. Now, also facing 
blackouts, they want to tilt balance of power away from the Golden State and 
toward themselves.


By PETER G. GOSSELIN, Times Staff Writer


     WINTERSBURG, Ariz.--For more than a century, California ran a simple 
account with the rest of the West: It demanded and the West supplied, most 
especially water and power.
     But as the Western states have ballooned in the last decade--in no small 
part because of an outbound trek of Californians--this simple, supply-demand 
relationship has broken down.
     Fundamentally, the rest of the West has outgrown its electrical system 
just as California has its own. And it has done so in very much the same 
way--by adding too many people without enough new power or conservation.
     Indeed, statistics show that much of the rest of the West would have 
been on the verge of trouble even without California's help and may yet face 
the sort of rolling blackouts that have wreaked so much havoc in the Golden 
State.
     The booming Southwest has run its power grid at such a fever pitch that 
its planning reserves--the extra power that utilities build in to handle 
emergencies--have shrunk to levels that many regulators and industry experts 
consider dangerous.
     Almost none of the West save Montana has increased its power production 
at anything like the pace of its population growth during the last decade. 
Despite the long economic boom of the 1990s, which smiled especially on the 
West, several, such as Arizona, have failed to complete a single new power 
plant.
     ""We don't know how bad it's going to be yet,"" said Utah's Republican 
governor, Mike Leavitt. ""We won't know that until May, June, July and August, 
when everyone in the Southwest turns on their swamp coolers.""
     In trying to dodge the blackout bullet, many Western leaders are seeking 
to force a great change on the region: to renegotiate their states' basic 
deal with California. They want to end an old relationship--that between 
center and hinterland, colonizer and colonized--and establish a new one that 
could curtail California's long regional dominance.
     In the strange chemistry of the moment--when a once-Republican state 
government has turned Democratic and a once-Democratic national government 
has turned Republican, when the battle is to a large extent over privately 
owned electricity rather than publicly controlled water--they could actually 
meet with some success.
     ""California spent the 20th century decolonizing itself from Wall Street 
and the East,"" said Kevin Starr, the state librarian and author of a 
multivolume history of California. ""Now, all of a sudden, there's a dramatic 
possibility of it being recolonized, at least in part, by the rest of the 
West.""

     Captive Plants Feed Power to California
     Ground zero for these changes lies 50 miles west of Phoenix in the dry 
scrublands of Wintersburg. This is home to the Palo Verde nuclear facility, 
now the nation's single biggest power producer. It will soon be home as well 
to between three and six new gas-fired power plants that, combined, will 
produce even more electricity than their giant neighbor.
     Palo Verde represents a great deal about the old, fraying world of 
regulated utilities and about the supply-demand relationships that California 
once maintained with the rest of the West.
     More than one-quarter of the plant is owned by Los Angeles' municipal 
utility, the Department of Water and Power, several other California cities 
and Southern California Edison.
     A row of steel latticework towers runs off toward California, carrying a 
transmission line from plant to consumer. California has big stakes in a 
half-dozen similarly captive plants in an arc of states from Nevada to New 
Mexico.
     From California's point of view, the beauty of these projects has been 
that they provided near-certain power without the muss of meeting state 
pollution standards or the political hassle of building closer to home.
     And at least until the mid-1990s, California regulators virtually 
guaranteed that their owners covered their costs and made profits, even if 
plants' power wasn't immediately needed.
     ""The first principle of the old system was that you had to be able to 
meet demand, no matter what,"" said Paul L. Joskow, a veteran utility 
economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
     ""If you had too much power, if it cost you a little too much, that was 
less important than being sure you could meet demand."" And, he added, ""you 
had regulators watching to make sure you did.""
     The gas-fired plants that are about to pop up in Wintersburg are also 
representative, but of the new, deregulated world of power production. 
Although they will crowd in around Palo Verde and tap into the same 
California transmission line, they are being built on an entirely different 
business premise: selling power to the highest bidder.
     In fact, the reason this empty patch of desert has become such an 
electricity hot spot lately is not Palo Verde itself, but its huge 
transmission lines. In addition to the California line, four others fan out 
from the plant: two back to Phoenix, one east to New Mexico, and one north to 
Utah and from there to the Northwest.
     All were built to hard-wire the nuclear project to its owners. But they 
are now seen as the means by which a new breed of producer can get top dollar 
by sending power wherever prices are highest.
     ""It used to be generating capacity was built by people who looked at the 
market to see if they could meet demand,"" said Jack Davis, president of 
Pinnacle West Capital Corp., which owns Arizona's major utility and is 
putting up two of the Wintersburg plants.
     ""Now,"" he said approvingly, ""it's being built by people who look at the 
market to see if you can make a lot of money.""

     Plans Go Awry in Many States
     Money, not the watchful eye of government, was what was supposed to 
assure that electricity deregulation worked. The opportunity to make it would 
cause investors to flock to the electricity business, ensuring that plenty of 
new power plants got built.
     If too many went up, it would be investors, not ratepayers, who 
suffered. If too few, then high prices would attract still more investors, 
more plants and, ultimately, more power.
     But to date, almost nothing about deregulation has gone as planned--and 
not just in California, but in the West in general.
     Take Arizona. The state has a hands-off attitude toward business, 
including its utilities. It has almost none of the environmental restrictions 
blamed for keeping California from putting up the new plants it needs.
     Its population grew by 40% from 1990 to 2000, according to the Census 
Bureau. And its demand for electricity expanded at nearly twice that rate, 
according to industry figures.
     ""Arizona should have been a power producer's heaven,"" said A. Michael 
Schaal, a senior analyst with Energy Ventures Analysis Inc., a prominent 
Washington-area consulting firm.
     But Arizona's power production rose a mere 4% during the 1990s, mostly 
as a result of improving existing plants. Until 18 months ago, no one had 
applied to build a major power plant since Palo Verde in the late 1980s.
     ""I guess I go on the assumption that the utilities plan with some sort 
of 10-, 20-, 30-year time horizon,"" Arizona's Republican Gov. Jane Dee Hull 
said in a recent interview. ""I think what we all worry about is: Are they 
planning?""
     Or Nevada. Its utilities apparently did plan and increased 
electricity-making capacity between 1990 and 2000 by a substantial 44%. But 
that wasn't enough to keep up with the state's population, which increased 
66%. On Thursday, Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn, a Republican and former energy 
company executive, indefinitely halted deregulation in his state.
     Or traditionally energy-rich Washington state. One of its major 
utilities, Seattle City Light, recently learned that all of its previously 
planned supply increase for the next four years will be consumed, and then 
some, by just three new customers: computer server farms being built to 
handle the growing Internet traffic in and out of the high-tech capital.
     But it's unlikely to be able to get extra power soon because regional 
supplies are balanced on a ""razor's edge,"" according to Northwest Power Pool 
President Jerry Rust. ""We have no cushion.""
     Indeed, the electricity supplies of the entire West are balanced on a 
razor's edge, with a variety of forecasters predicting serious shortages this 
summer.
     Schaal, the Washington-area consultant, for example, said the region 
will come up 6% short. ""Westerners can expect 150 to 275 hours of rolling 
blackouts, most of them in California,"" he said.
     One of the most striking aspects of the current situation is that, in 
contrast to what most people think, supplies have not grown short just 
recently.
     They have been perilously tight for the last several years--before the 
start of California's troubles of this summer and fall, and before the 
near-record dry winter that has left the Northwest dangerously short of water 
for its hydroelectric dams.
     The implication is that California did not cause other states to run 
short of power so much as trigger events that exposed their danger. It did 
that, according to key observers, with one monumentally inept maneuver.
     When California required its major utilities to buy power in the 
volatile spot market and simultaneously prohibited them from passing along 
higher costs to consumers, it set off a furious price spiral.
     That effectively stripped the entire region of its energy security 
blanket, the assurance that it could buy extra power relatively inexpensively 
if local supplies proved inadequate.
     The result has been a string of crises across the West.
     In southern Arizona, for example, the San Carlos Irrigation Project, a 
tiny public utility that tried to jump into the deregulation vanguard by 
dropping long-term contracts in hopes of more power at lower prices in the 
spot market, has announced that its bills are going up 300%. Most of the 
project's 13,300 poor customers say they can't pay.
     In Phoenix, utility executives who had confidently said the state was 
rich with new power projects about to come on line have decided to pull two 
50-year-old steam plants out of mothballs and rent a pair of portable 
generators to reduce purchases from the expensive spot market.
     In Idaho, the big power company is appealing to potato farmers to skip 
planting and sell the electricity they would use running irrigation pumps 
back to the firm. Company executives figure the buyback will be cheaper than 
purchasing power on the open market--and the potato farmers are likely to do 
pretty well themselves.

     Deep Hostility in Rest of the West
     The subtle difference between California's triggering recent events and 
actually causing the region's crisis is largely lost in the current 
atmosphere of apprehension and upheaval. Although leaders of the rest of the 
West are scrupulously evenhanded in commenting to outsiders about their big 
neighbor, they are less guarded at home.
     The normally mild-mannered Leavitt, for example, was recently quoted as 
warning a Salt Lake City audience that ""California, if given the chance, 
would put a shunt into our veins and bleed us pretty quickly."" (In an 
interview, he denied having made the remark.)
     Such comments reflect an old and easily rekindled view among Westerners 
that their states are, in the words of historian Bernard DeVoto, ""plundered 
provinces""--terrain that first Easterners and then Californians have 
regularly raided for minerals, water and, most recently, power.
     But this time, some Western leaders think they can change all this. ""A 
lot of people see an opportunity to rewrite the fundamental relationship with 
California to their advantage,"" said Stanford historian Richard White.
     The attempts at rewriting are taking shape across the West.
     In the Northwest, Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Montana are redoubling 
their efforts to take over the Bonneville Power Administration, the huge, 
federally controlled generating system on the Columbia and Snake rivers that 
is one of California's chief sources of summer electricity. 
     ""The crisis has highlighted the danger that power generated in the 
region can be exported without the region's consent,"" Oregon Gov. John 
Kitzhaber said in an interview.
     In Arizona, state officials have gone from having no proposals for new 
power plants to being buried by them. Regulators recently approved the 
construction of 10 plants, including several around Palo Verde, and are 
considering another eight.
     Although they are requiring the plants to temporarily serve Arizona's 
needs first, the facilities will soon be able to sell their power for 
whatever prices they can command, an arrangement that could leave California 
just one among many bidders.
     (Federal officials are unlikely to get in the way: Gov. Hull is close to 
President Bush, who in turn has shown little interest in helping Democratic 
California.)
     Perhaps the most aggressive efforts at change are occurring in Utah, 
where Leavitt is trying something that could become California's worst 
nightmare--recalling power that Utah produces for the state.
     Los Angeles' DWP and several other California utilities own 
three-quarters of the huge, coal-fired Intermountain Power Project in 
west-central Utah, and have been drawing on it without incident for 15 years.
     But Utah officials recently unearthed a long-forgotten provision in 
their agreement with the plant's owners that gives them the right, with 
proper notice, to recall power for local use.
     The state has already notified Los Angeles that it is taking back 50 
megawatts of electricity capacity this summer and another 170 next summer, 
and it may be able to take back still more, according to plant general 
manager Reed Searle.
     Although the amounts are trivial--the Los Angeles utility either owns or 
has firm contracts for more than 7,000 megawatts of capacity--Leavitt said 
Utah will demand similar recall provisions in agreements for any new plants 
in the state, including a 500- to 750-megawatt facility that Los Angeles is 
negotiating to build.
     ""California has chosen not to create its own power generation and has 
depended on us to do that,"" the Utah governor said. ""That's fine and we're 
willing to do that.
     ""But,"" he added, ""there comes a point at which, if demand grows too 
large, we've got to hold some of this capacity back for ourselves, and for 
our children and grandchildren.""
     If Utah and the rest of the West have reached that point, California 
could be in for a much bigger and more enduring shock than the one from which 
it now suffers.

Today's focus: McVeigh video really a virus

By Jason Meserve (write me at jmeserve@nww.com)

You knew someone would take advantage of the recent execution
of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh to spread a virus.
According to a number of computer security types, a purported
video of the McVeigh execution circulating the 'Net is actually
a virus that drops the SubSeven backdoor onto infected systems.

For those who don't know, SubSeven can be used to take over
control of the infected machine and be used in distributed
denial-of-service attacks. The good news is that most updated
antivirus scanners already detect this virus, so if your
systems are up to date, you should be safe.

For more on this, check out this wire story posted on
DigitalMass.com:

Today's bug patches and security alerts:


* SQL security hole lets attackers take over

A security flaw in Microsoft's SQL Server 7.0 and SQL Server
2000 Gold can allow an attacker to take control of a targeted
server, the company said in a security bulletin late Tuesday
night. Microsoft issued a patch for the flaw at the same time
it released the bulletin.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2001/0613sqlhole.html
IDG News Service, 06/13/01

For a patch and more information from Microsoft:
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-032.asp


* Microsoft has third go at Exchange hole

Microsoft has issued a third version of a patch intended to
plug a security hole that could allow hackers access to
mailboxes on Exchange Server Versions 5.5 and 2000. The second
patch contained outdated files, Microsoft said in an updated
security bulletin issued Wednesday.

http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-030.asp


* HP warns of potential DoS vulnerability in kmmodreg

Hewlett-Packard is warning its HP-UX operating system users of
a potential denial-of-service vulnerability in the kmmodreg
command, which is executed each time the system is booted. The
problem with the package also could be used to increase
privileges on the affected system. HP-UX users can download a
patch for the kmmodreg problem by logging on to HP's IT
Resource Center at:
http://itrc.hp.com


* Xinetd patch released by Linux OS vendors

Many Linux vendors have released a patch for the xinetd package
that fixes a flaw in the way the application deals with TCP
WAIT commands. The problem prevents the linuxconf-web
application from working properly. Another flaw in the xinetd
package creates world-writeable files that can be used in a
symlink attack. Linux-Mandrake users can download the new patch
from:
http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/ftp.php3

Red Hat users can get more information and links to patches
from:
http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-075.html

Immunix OS 7.0-beta and 7.0 users can get the appropriate patch
from:
http://download.immunix.org/ImmunixOS/7.0/updates/RPMS/xinetd-2.1.8.9pre15-2

_imnx.i386.rpm


* Linux-Mandrake patches tcpdump

Linux-Mandrake has issued a patch for its tcpdump package that
fixes a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The flaw could
be used in a remote attack on the tcpdump process. This patch
also fixes a previous vulnerability that could allow a remote
user to run arbitrary code on the affected system without root
privileges. The new patch can be downloaded from:
http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/ftp.php3


* Linux-Mandrake fixes imap flaw

According to an alert from Linux-Mandrake, several flaws have
been found in the UW-IMAP package that could allow an
authenticated user to gain greater shell command access. This
is particularly problematic for e-mail systems that do not
normally provide shell access. Patches can be downloaded from:
http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/ftp.php3


* Conectiva patches exim

A printf vulnerability exists in exim, a mail transfer utility.
The flaw in the code deals with the way exim check e-mail
headers without protecting against a printf format attack.
Conectiva users can download the appropriate patch from:
ftp://atualizacoes.conectiva.com.br/6.0/SRPMS/exim-3.16-4U60_1cl.src.rpm
ftp://atualizacoes.conectiva.com.br/6.0/RPMS/exim-3.16-4U60_1cl.i386.rpm

ftp://atualizacoes.conectiva.com.br/6.0/RPMS/exim-mon-3.16-4U60_1cl.i386.rpm



* Red Hat issues patch for ispell

According to an alert from Red Hat, the ispell program uses
mktemp() to open temporary files, which makes it vulnerable to
symlink attacks. For more information and to download a patch:
http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-074.html


* GnuPG patch available for Red Hat Linux users

GnuPG, an open source version of PGP, contains a number of
flaws that could leave a user's private key exposed. The
problem is a format string vulnerability in GnuPG's code. For
more information and links to the appropriate download:
http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-073.html


* Red Hat: LPRng fails to drop supplemental group membership

According to an alert from Red Hat, LPRng fails to drop
supplemental group membership at init time, though it does
properly setuid and setgid. The result is that LPRng, and its
children, maintain any supplemental groups that the process
starting LPRng had at the time it started LPRng. This is a
security risk. Download the appropriate patch from:

Red Hat Linux 7.0:
alpha:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/7.0/en/os/alpha/LPRng-3.7.4-23.alpha.rpm
i386:

* ScreamingMedia patches SiteWare vulnerability

A flaw in ScreamingMedia's SiteWare Web server could allow a
user to view all documents in the SiteWare Web hierarchy. A
similar problem could allow any file to be retrieved from the
system. More information and a patch can be found at:
http://www01.screamingmedia.com/en/security/sms1001.php


Today's round up of virus alerts:


* Simpsons worm hits Macs

When the Mac vs. PC wars start up, as they inevitably do, on
Usenet or Web message boards or just around the office, Mac
partisans always tout the dearth of viruses for their chosen
computer as one of the main benefits in adopting Apple's
operating system. And though, technically, there still may not
be very many viruses for the Mac, a new Mac e-mail worm has
recently been discovered and is making its way across iMacs and
Powerbooks everywhere.

IDG News Service, 06/11/01


* Virus hoax warns people to delete AOL

Perhaps the greatest thrill for any prankster is to have his
hoax taken as truth. Just such a thing has happened to Ray
Owens, who runs a Web site called Joke A Day. Owens sent an e-
mail to the 342,000 of his subscribers on June 5 (after an
initial mailing on June 2 to another list) warning them of a
new virus, called AOL.EXE. Warning your customers of a virus
seems like a nice thing to do, except that AOL.EXE isn't a
virus at all; it's the AOL application that provides Internet
access to millions of people worldwide.

IDG News Service, 06/11/01

* WM97/Myna-AR - A Word macro virus with no malicious payload.
(Sophos)

* XM97/Laroux-OC - This Excel macro virus spreads by creating a
file called ""BINV.XLS"" in the XLSTART directory. (Sophos)

* WM97/Opey-AU - This Word macro virus removes the macros
section of the tools menu and disables the Visual Basic Editor.
It also displays five different messages on five different
dates. (Sophos)

* XM97/Barisada-Y - An Excel macro virus that spreads via a
file called ""KHM.XLS"" in the XLSTART directory. Unlike its
predecessors, this one does not contain pop-up messages.
(Sophos)

* VBS/Lovelet-CE - Yet another variant of the infamous
LoveLetter virus. This one comes with a subject line of ""News
Email Beta Run1.01"" and a file attachment called
""NEWSEMAIL.VBS."" (Sophos)


>From the interesting reading department:


* Hackers taunt EC with site defacement

Dutch hackers on Tuesday evening defaced SaferInternet.org, a
Web site sponsored by the European Commission that promotes a
safer Internet. Security at the site had been increased just
last week after other hackers raised a red flag about possible
vulnerabilities.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2001/0613hackers.html
IDG News Service, 06/13/01


* Microsoft plugs seven Telnet security holes in Windows 2000

If the Telnet service included with Microsoft's Windows 2000
operating system has looked suspiciously like Swiss cheese
recently, that might be because it has seven security holes
that need patching. Microsoft has acknowledged the holes and
issued a patch late last week.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2001/0611msplug.html
IDG News Service, 06/11/01


* When private peering arrangements go bad: Cable & Wireless
shuts out 14 ISPs, including PSINet

Cable & Wireless likely didn't make any new friends on the
Internet last week when it started enforcing its newly revised
peering policy, cutting off service to more than a dozen ISPs.

And though, technically, there still may not be very many viruses for the Mac, a new Mac e-mail worm has recently been discovered and is making its way across iMacs and Powerbooks everywhere. http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2001/0611simpsons.html IDG News Service, 06/11/01 * Virus hoax warns people to delete AOL Perhaps the greatest thrill for any prankster is to have his hoax taken as truth. Just such a thing has happened to Ray Owens, who runs a Web site called Joke A Day. Owens sent an e- mail to the 342,000 of his subscribers on June 5 (after an initial mailing on June 2 to another list) warning them of a new virus, called AOL.EXE. Warning your customers of a virus seems like a nice thing to do, except that AOL.EXE isn't a virus at all; it's the AOL application that provides Internet access to millions of people worldwide. http://www.nwfusion.com/net.worker/news/2001/0611aolhoax.html IDG News Service, 06/11/01 * WM97/Myna-AR - A Word macro virus with no malicious payload.

Subject:=09EES Billing Issues

Privileged and Confidential Attorney-Client Communication

This is to recap our discussion today about two billing issues--recoupment =
of the PX Credit and the $10 surcharge.  I would appreciate it if those of =
you with more first-hand information, particularly Wanda and Diann, correct=
 or clarify anything I've misstated.  Also, please forward this to anyone e=
lse with an interest in this matter.

A.  Recoupment of the PX Credit (also known as the ""Negative CTC"")

     1.  Background:  The issue here relates to the fact that PG&E and SCE =
are no longer reflecting credit balances on the bills for our customers.  P=
rior to our returning the customers to bundled service in March, the bills =
would reflect the PX Credit as an offset to T&D charges.  SCE and PG&E have=
 now removed the PX Credit from the bill and are attempting to charge us fo=
r T&D, despite the fact that they owe us hundreds of millions of dollars in=
 PX Credits.  This is potentially harmful particularly in view of the opini=
on of perhaps three of the Commissioners that the PX Credit can only be col=
lected as a bill credit, and not in cash.  Mike Day, our regulatory lawyer,=
 expressed his strong opinion that removing the Credit from the bills was i=
mproper, and that we should challenge the action by making a filing with th=
e CPUC.  Note:  the PX Credit to which I am referring here is that which ac=
crued to prior to December 31, 2000; the utilities do not dispute that a PX=
 Credit accrued during that time frame, and there is no dispute as to the p=
roper methodology for computing the PX Credit for that time frame.  Further=
more, PG&E and SCE are in virtual agreement with us as to the amount of the=
 Credit that had accrued as of December 31, 2000.

    2.   Action Items/Issues:  (a)  With respect to SCE, Legal is evaluatin=
g filing a suit in federal court versus filing at the CPUC.  The CPUC has a=
 process whereby we could prevent the utilities from disconnecting our cust=
omers while the issue is being determined (by depositing the payments in an=
 interest-bearing account controlled by the CPUC); while there is no equiva=
lent procedure in federal court, one can request that the court enter an in=
junction against the utilities disconnecting customers.   While the analysi=
s is worth doing, I suspect that we will conclude that we have to go to the=
 CPUC for relief.  (b)  With respect to PG&E, the banruptcy team is evaluat=
ing whether to file at the CPUC or in bankruptcy court.

    3.  Timing:  Late fees will begin accruing August 20.  The first discon=
nect notices would not be received until September 19.

    4.  Effect on other CTC issues:  Pursuing action at the CPUC or in cour=
t to force the utilities to restore the PX Credit to our bills has no effec=
t on the issues of how the CTC should be calculated post-January 17, and pr=
ospectively.

B.  $10 Surcharge

     1.  Backgound:  Although when provisionally imposed in January the $10=
 surcharge went to the utilities to keep them financially solvent,  when ma=
de permanent in March it became dedicated to defray the DWR's purchases of =
power on behalf of the utilities.  This evolution gives rise to two bases f=
or EES to argue that it should not bear the financial burden of the $10 sur=
charge.  First, since the $10 surcharge is now dedicated to purchasing gene=
ration for bundled customers only, and not direct access customers, direct =
access should not have to pay it.  This is the same logic that caused the C=
PUC to exempt direct access customers from the $30 surcharge.
Secondly, if legitimately applied to direct access, because it is of no dir=
ect benefit to direct access customers it (arguably) can only be viewed as =
a tax.  Under EES's contracts with its customers, taxes assessed at the del=
ivery point are borne by the customer.  Note:  SCE, unlike PG&E, may not im=
pose the $10 surcharge on direct access customers, according to a filing ma=
de at the staff level at the CPUC, so this action may relate to PG&E only.

     2.  Action Items/Issues:  (a)  Regulatory (Jim Steffes) has the lead i=
n advising us about a challenge to the application of the $10 surcharge to =
direct access customers at the CPUC.  It may be advisable for an industry g=
roup rather than Enron to make the filing.  (b)  I would expect that we wou=
ld follow the same procedure outlined above--depositing the payment with th=
e CPUC--to prevent any customer from being disconnected.  In the interim we=
 would likely bill the customer for the surcharge and promise a credit if o=
ur challenge to the application of the surcharge to DA customers is success=
ful. (c) A decision will need to be made on how far we go back--to July 1 w=
hen the customers became DA again or to January 4 when the surcharge was fi=
rst imposed.

     3.  Timing.  Same timeframe as with the Recoupment issue since we will=
 need to have CPUC challenge on file to prevent late fees and disconnect no=
tices.

     4.  Effect on other CTC issues:  Regulatory (Jim Steffes) will analyze=
 with the appropriate people the effect, if any, of taking this position on=
 other CTC issues (principally how CTC should be calculated post-January 17=
, and prospectively).=20

Does anyone have an idea as to why marketers, including EPMI, are not 
included in the list of subject companies:  Exh. B?  Since EPMI is not a 
subject of the motion, why should it answer?  Lying in the weeds may be a 
more prudent course of action.

>>> ""Fergus, Gary S."" <GFergus@brobeck.com> 11/07/00 10:08PM >>>
I just spoke with Mary to make sure we have the same information.  Here are
the facts we have so far.  On November 4th, the CPUC filed a motion with
FERC to adopt the form of protective order that the CPUC entered, to compel
the production of documents and to shorten time to answer.  According to
Exhibit B (read to me by Nancy Pickover at Bracewell) the following CPUC
moved against the following entities:  AES, Williams, Duke, Dynegy, Reliant
and Southern.  Enron entities were NOT named in exhibit B.  This is not to
say that we could not be easily added to the group.  While the motion reads
as if the CPUC was moving against everybody, in fact, in footnote 2 they
state they are only moving against the entities named in Exhibit B.  We will
have Exhibit B in hand first thing tomorrow via FEDEX to confirm this.  To
repeat, Enron is not named yet.

Thanks

Subject: Important - CPUC Motion - Confidential Attorney Client
Privilege and Work Product


As you may already know, the CPUC filed a motion at FERC asking for a
protective order and to compel production of the information they subpoened
from us in the CPUC's OII case.  Given the timing, we should discuss this
on our conference call scheduled for tomorrow.

They request that we be required:
to answer their motion on Thursday,
to provide the information within 5 working days of a FERC ordering
production, and
to provide of P&L information and spread sheets detailing our deals,
specifically delivery point, delivery date, counterparty, volume and
price.

We may not have a problem providing this information for use by FERC in its
proceeding subject to a confidentiality agreement but I think we would
oppose their requests for:
the information to be provided for ""government eyes only"" -  this would
prohibit EPMI from defending itself vis-a-vis other market participants.
a FERC confidentiality order that would could allow FERC to ""share"" this
information with the CPUC (for purposes of the PUC's OII proceeding)
pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 824h(c).  16 USC 824g(c) requires the Commission
to make information available to state commissions as may be of
assistance in state regulation of public utilities.  We should argue
that 16 USC 824h(c) does not apply here given that we are not a public
utility nor does the PUC regulate how much market power wholesale
marketers exercise or the level of market power mitigation (these are
the bases the PUC provides for explaining why it should have this
information.)
the above contractual information to allow them to analyze the
competitiveness of the forward market to evaluate the wisdom of the
Commission's  decision to allow the UDC's ""unfettered access"" to the
forwards market.  This argument is unpersuasive given that the CPUC can
get information about the competitiveness of the forward markets from
the Wall Street Journal's listing of NYMEX prices.

---------------------------------


Peggy, we had wanted to add NEPCO to the bid list of bidders for the EPC
bid for the Cayote II Project.  Greg Piper has informed me that PGE is of
the opinion that we cannot even have NEPCO participate in the bid because
PGE does not think that would be able to get by the regulators.

Before accepting this as fact, can you confirm that we can not even 
participate in the bid process because NEPCO is an affiliate of Enron.  It 
seems that the best interest of the rate payers is in getting a winning 
competitive bid.  Are affiliates precluded from competitive bids in this 
process?

Again, I don't want to accept a no without insuring that it's absolutely 
necessary.  Thanks for your help.

Jeff

At the end of last week, there was a very interesting TV news story on NBC
KRON Channel 4 in San Francisco.  You lead the story, which also includes
Governor Davis, President Bush.

What most catches my attention are the visuals and chant of the protestors
during the Enron segment.  The props and signs are very TV camera friendly.
For instance, there is a larger then life mask of you and a mockup of a
""paycheck"" to you from the people of California.  The chant rhymes with your
name.

From my perspective, this was no simple pie in the face.  This protest was
very organized and sophisticated.  I think it would be prudent to gain more
information about who was behind it and who was behind them.
I tried sending you the video file in mpeg format, but at 8,400k it was too
large to email.  To see the news clip, you may double click this link
http://www.sfgate.com/av/movies/2001/06/21/power_kronm.mpg.  After
downloading, the video will play on a computer that has ""Real Player.""

Yesterday, the Federal Trade Commission issued a staff report on electricity restructuring issues.  It is an update of the July 2000 report done at the request of House Energy Chairman Tauzin and Subcommittee Chairman Barton.  They requested the report be updated.  A summary of the report and the full 80+ page text is on the FTC web site at www.ftc.gov on the upper left side of the home page.

I read the summary and will read the balance.  So far, so good.  It basically says that even states that have opened up to retail competition are in transition with a hybrid of regulation and competition, thus the expected benefits of competition have not yet emerged.  However, the report states that nothing to date indicates that competition, once the transition period is over, will not produce additional benefits for consumers.  The report's major conclusion is that competitive wholesale markets are important to achieving effective competition in retail markets.  

The summary includes something that sounds promising on RTO policy, saying ""And as wholesale and retail markets become regional, governing policies and jurisdictional approaches also must move in that direction for wholesale and retail competition to be successful.""","FTC Staff Report on Electricity Restructuring.

		 Subject: FERC/SEC Update

As you all may know, we have scheduled a conference call for the group for 
Thursday, Oct. 19.  Bernadette called each of your assistants, so it should 
be on your calendars.

As a brief update prior to our call:

We have a phone call in to FERC to check on the procedural status of the 
merger.  Donna Fulton, my colleague in Washington, has many contacts at FERC 
and is working with those people to learn what she can about the status of 
our proceeding.  

Joanne is supposed to be meeting with Bob Wasson at the SEC (along with Bill 
Weedon) early next week to get a sense of where the SEC is on the case.

Per Rick's suggestion, I have asked another colleague of mine in Washington, 
Chris Long, to help us decide who would be the appropriate person to make 
contact at the SEC if we decide to make that contact.  Chris is working with 
some political operatives on this.

We have been working with Portland General and Sierra on their RTO filing.  
As you may recall, a commitment to join an RTO (Regional Transmission 
Organization) is one of the things FERC will require of the merging parties.  
An RTO filing will be made at FERC on October 23.  While RTO progress has 
been good so far, Sierra and PGE have indicated that they may have concerns 
with the RTO they are working with (the Northwest RTO).  We are working with 
Sierra and PGE to make sure that they do not do anything in the RTO 
proceeding that could cause concern for FERC regarding the companies' 
commitment to join an RTO.

There was some question about the status of a temporary services company 
being created by the merged company.  Joanne has been working with the Sierra 
and PGE people on this issue and does not see this as being a problem now, 
but I have asked her for confirmation that this ""alternative"" type of service 
company arrangement will not delay the SEC proceeding.  I am waiting for a 
response from Joanne.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  

Sarah

excess natural gas at the California border.  I am aware of several of these 
sales and have been  informed that excess pressure at the border is the basic 
reason for them.  I'd like a more specific explanation that includes the 
following information:
1.  What are the specific pressures and volume considerations that could make 
it operationally necessary to sell gas at the California border?  
2.  What is the process that is followed to make such a determination?
3.  Which individuals or groups are involved in determining whether an 
operational sale is necessary?
4.  In what way have system operations changed since last year and how do 
those changes contribute to the increased frequency of such sales compared to 
previous years?
5. What alternatives to operational sales are considered before the decision 
to make a sale is reached?

At the right time, it would be helpful to discuss what we may want to consider as ""Core"" Assets (unrelated to trading activities) for purposes of emerging from bankruptcy as a going concern.  As you know, we are in the process of organizing and formatting in an asset matrix the assets/businesses we currently own (or otherwise have an interest in) that may be potentially for sale; separating out potential core assets will be instructive as part of this process.

Please let me know your thoughts/suggestions over the next few weeks.

Subject:	Confidential - GSS Organization Value to ETS


Here are my thoughts on the value the GSS (Global Strategic Sourcing) brings to ETS:

I believe totally in the concept of strategically sourcing our materials and services for ETS, which is the concept that GSS was founded under, while still within the ETS organization.  Basically the value that GSS has brought to the bottom line during the last year has been minimal to ETS.   The reasons for that statement, in my opinion, are:

*	The materials and services that ETS purchase are basic and routine.
*	Most of those materials and service providers were identified and sourced during 1999 and 2000.
*	ETS is reaching the point where we need fewer providers, not more.
*	New items identified are normally rolled into one of our already sourced NPA's.
*	Almost all large dollar items are bid out (three bids and a buy).
*	GSS's involvement and commitment to the deal ends with the contract signing.
*	ETS P&SM organization and our Contracts services group deals with the actual execution and the ringing of the cash register.


If the GSS organization went away tomorrow, we would need the following expertise brought over from their group: (currently this group is close to 75 people.)(and very highly paid individuals)

*	Two (2) negotiators - Contract Managers
*	Two (2) analysts
*	Two (2) contract administrators

The administration of the following services would need to be shifted to the ISC:

*	iBuyit System
*	Catalog system (part of iBuyit)
*	iPayit system

We would need to re-assess the value of the contract with SourceNet and whether we continue down that path or implement our own A/P department.   This would take very few staff adds to make that happen.

Let me know if you need any further detail.

Steve, it was great to meet you and hear your remarks yesterday.  For the 
speaking engagement next Wednesday, I would like you to focus upon the Enron 
strategic model of virtual integration of market forces in the evolution of 
energy development.  Wyoming represents a huge material resource base and the 
commission is charged with the development and promotion of such.  But the 
Governor's message is that we cannot see ourselves as producers and exporters 
in the traditional sense.  We will continue to have the status of a colony if 
we do not recognize the new dynamics of how these market places are 
evolving.  If you set the stage with a presentation of Enron strategy, then 
we will discuss how a state, with its agencies and auathority can play a role 
in this evolution.  I have set your time for 45 minutes, which can include a 
short Qand A period.  But your message can be as succint as you can make it 
and get the point across.  You may have to present the Enron case a number of 
different ways, but the Governor will give you latitude to make the point.   
You will be welcome to participate in a following panel which will address

Hopes dim for a quick Edison deal 
By Kevin Yamamura
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published July 27, 2001) 
The Assembly will not return this week to consider a plan to save 
California's second-largest utility from bankruptcy, all but ending hopes 
that legislation would reach Gov. Gray Davis by a mid-August deadline. 
A group of legislators and Davis staffers has worked this week on an 
agreement that would restore Southern California Edison's credit and relieve 
the state of having to purchase energy for the utility. 
Assembly leaders, who convened the group, set an ambitious schedule that 
would have led to a vote today had they reached consensus and been able to 
recall enough of the 80 Assembly members from summer recess destinations. 
But the newly formed plan, which would issue $2.9 billion in consumer-backed 
bonds in exchange for several Edison concessions, remains too rough for a 
vote, said Paul Hefner, a spokesman for Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, 
D-Sherman Oaks. 
Hefner was quick to note that Hertzberg has the Assembly ""on call"" for the 
scheduled monthlong break and is prepared to ask members to return if a deal 
comes in the next three weeks. 
But staff and lawmakers said earlier that organizing a mass return after 
today would prove nearly impossible because Assembly members are expected to 
travel throughout the state and beyond. 
Davis set an Aug. 15 deadline in his original Edison deal and recently said 
he could call a special session forcing legislators to return if they do not 
authorize a plan by then. 
His spokesman, Steven Maviglio, said Thursday the governor is not ruling out 
that idea but is waiting to see what comes of further legislative 
discussions. 
""It's pretty clear that everyone's working pretty hard to form a consensus, 
but they're just not there,"" Maviglio said. ""The governor is optimistic about 
the Aug. 15 date."" 
Even so, Edison does not expect a solution by then. Company officials stated 
earlier this week that they would wait for a political deal at least until 
lawmakers return Aug. 20.

Sempra's trading unit generates a windfall  


\
objattph 
By Craig D. Rose  UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  July 27, 2001  Sempra Energy, 
the parent company of SDG&E, reported a 25 percent surge in profit to $137 
million last quarter but said yesterday it lost money on the sale of 
electricity under a long-term contract to California.  On the other hand, 
Sempra said its largest source of profits was its energy trading unit, a 
middleman that earned $69 million during the quarter buying and selling 
energy produced by others.  The results underscore the transformation of 
relatively simple utility companies into diversified energy holding companies 
that have learned to profit in new ways from the deregulation of electricity 
and the turmoil in energy markets.  The surprising announcement -- that a 
company lost money selling power during California's run-up in electricity 
prices -- was explained by Sempra as an intentional consequence of the 
long-term contract it signed with the state to provide power.  Stephen Baum, 
chairman and chief executive officer of Sempra, said the company agreed to 
provide a steep discount to California during the summer months but would 
recoup the losses later in the 10-year deal.  California sought long-term 
electricity purchase contracts so it could reduce its purchases in daily and 
near-term power markets, where prices reached record levels.  Critics say 
Gov. Gray Davis rushed into long-term deals because of concerns about getting 
through next year's election. They also say the contracts will saddle 
customers with higher costs for years.  The governor has acknowledged that 
long-term contracts might cause consumers to pay relatively high prices for 
electricity in later years, but he maintains it is a fair price to pay for 
lowering prices that were devastating the state economy.  Michael Shames, 
executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, 
said the steep discount Sempra provided to the state on power this summer 
raised questions about the governor's proposal to help San Diego Gas & 
Electric Co. clear a debt of $750 million.  SDG&E says it is owed that money 
for power purchases on behalf of its customers.  In a media conference last 
month, Davis said the agreement would eliminate the threat of a possible 
balloon payment for consumers, who he said might have faced the so-called 
balancing account debt as early as next year.  Shames says the proposal, 
which took the form of a memorandum of understanding, or MOU, is costly for 
consumers and a bonanza for Sempra.  He said the relatively cheap power 
provided by Sempra this summer ""makes the MOU sound like more of a hidden 
payback to Sempra than a real relief plan for local ratepayers.""  Shames said 
he will release an analysis of the state's Sempra plan next week. The state 
Public Utilities Commission is expected to rule on the plan in August.  A 
Sempra spokesman said there is no connection between discount power and the 
tentative agreement to clear the $750 million debt. Doug Kline, the Sempra 
spokesman, said the power contract with the state was signed in early May and 
the agreement on the balancing account was reached in mid-June.  Sempra 
Energy Trading, meanwhile, said only 10 percent of its $69 million profit was 
earned from sales of energy in the western region, which includes California. 
The trading operation earned $40 million in profit during the comparable 
period last year.  California's Independent System Operator, which manages 
most of the state power grid, and other investigators have said trading and 
bidding strategies were tools used by energy companies to raise prices during 
the California power crisis.  Though Sempra earned money on trading, its 
wholesale power generating business lost $9 million during the quarter. Baum 
said the discounts on electricity provided the state were the prime cause of 
the loss for Sempra Energy Resources but added that a plant outage also 
contributed.  Sempra Energy Resources, which co-owns a generating plant near 
Las Vegas with Reliant Energy, earned $2 million during the second quarter 
last year.  Baum added that Sempra's long-term contract with the state -- 
under which it will provide up to 1,900 megawatts -- has allowed its 
wholesale business to pre-sell about half the power it expects to generate 
from the Nevada plant, which will be expanded, and three generating 
facilities it expects to build.  Profits at SDG&E slipped to $37 million 
during the quarter ended June 30, down from $40 million last year, according 
to Sempra. SDG&E, whose business is restricted to delivering gas and 
electricity, said it provided increased customer service during the crisis, 
which lowered profits.  Wall Street analysts generally applauded Sempra's 
results, noting that the company was ahead of its plan to generate at least a 
third of its profits from its newer businesses by 2003.  ""They're really two 
years ahead of schedule for their non-utility businesses,"" said Brian 
Youngberg, an analyst with Edward Jones & Co.  Bud Leedom, a San Diego-based 
analyst with Wells Fargo Van Kasper, said Sempra's move into energy trading 
now seems shrewd. ""We never dreamed they were setting themselves for a 
windfall like this,"" Leedom said.  Investors pushed Sempra shares up 17 cents 
yesterday, to close at $25.49 in trading on The New York Stock Exchange.

Smog Rules May Be Eased
Power plants: EPA proposes a sweeping change in how utilities' emissions are 
curbed, a flexible approach favored by the industry.
By GARY POLAKOVIC and ELIZABETH SHOGREN
Times Staff Writers

July 27 2001

WASHINGTON -- U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Christie 
Whitman proposed sweeping changes Thursday in the regulation of power plant 
pollution that would replace five of the government's toughest programs with 
a single, flexible approach favored by utilities.

Whitman outlined a plan for cleaning up major components of power plant smog 
that represents a significant departure from the EPA's traditional regulatory 
dictums. She called for a major expansion of pollution credit trading, which, 
up to now, has had varying success.

Under the new plan, the EPA would scrap some of the most stringent measures 
devised by the agency to deal with power plant emissions. One provision to be 
set aside aims to cut harmful mercury emissions; another is meant to reduce 
emissions from Midwestern power plants by 85%; another is designed to restore 
visibility at national parks.

Especially unpopular with industry, one measure, known as new source review, 
requires the installation of advanced pollution controls whenever power 
plants are expanded or modified. It too would be phased out.

""New source review is certainly one of those regulatory aspects that would no 
longer be necessary,"" Whitman told Sen. George Voinovich (R-Ohio) at the 
hearing by the Environment and Public Works Committee. ""All of those 
[programs] could be aligned into one regulatory process"" that she said would 
work better than existing rules.

Whitman's comments offer the first peek into the administration's plans for 
cleaning some of the dirtiest polluters left in the nation. Debate over the 
administration's clean-air approach has shifted to Congress as it considers 
whether to revise the national Clean Air Act.

The magnitude of the proposed revisions caught environmentalists by surprise 
but buoyed industry representatives who say existing controls are costly and 
inefficient.

""She has raised an appalling prospect of junking virtually every rule and 
strategy to deal with emissions of electric companies in return for some 
vague industry-sought plan for an emissions trading scheme,"" said Frank 
O'Donnell, executive director of the Clean Air Trust, an environmental 
advocacy group. ""If they go forward with this, it means a wholesale fight 
over the Clean Air Act in Congress.""

After the hearing, Whitman stressed that the overall goal is to clean the air 
more efficiently than current rules do. Although the administration has not 
yet released a so-called multipollutant cleanup strategy, Whitman contended 
that collapsing several regulations into one far-reaching approach would be 
easier for regulators and industry to manage.

""What we're looking for is targets under this legislation that significantly 
clean up the air beyond what our current regulatory, statutory requirements 
would do,"" Whitman said. She added that new source review, for example, 
""could potentially be no longer necessary if you have the right kind of 
targets set in a multi-emissions bill. We have to wait and see where the 
targets are set.""

Utilities have lobbied Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force to 
prevent the EPA from aggressively enforcing the new source review regulation. 
Industry and administration officials say the provision is onerous and 
prevents plant upgrades, although EPA officials say it is a key tool for 
forcing dirty, old plants to cut emissions by up to 95%.

During the Clinton administration, federal officials charged that 32 
coal-fired power plants in several Southern and Midwestern states ignored a 
requirement that companies install advanced emission controls when their 
plants were upgraded. The government reached settlement with three utilities, 
but a provision in the Bush administration's energy plan stalled those 
enforcement actions pending a review of power plant controls.

C. Boyden Gray, attorney for the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council 
and former White House counsel for the first President Bush in the 1980s, 
praised the administration's proposal. He said major utility companies he 
represents, including Southern Co., Duke Energy Co. and the Tennessee Valley 
Authority, could clean up with greater flexibility and less cost under the 
plan outlined by Whitman.

""To put everything in a market-incentives basis is a great step. It would be 
a real breakthrough and a plus for the business community,"" Gray said.

For example, Gray said EPA has four separate measures to control nitrogen 
oxides from power plant combustion, including programs to cut acid rain, 
ozone and haze. Another program scheduled to take effect in May 2004 requires 
power plants in 19 states to cut summer emissions by 1 million tons annually. 
He said those programs can be confusing and costly and could easily be 
replaced by a credit-trading program run largely by power companies.

Under the program being considered by the Bush administration, an emission 
limit could be established at hundreds of power plants followed by annual 
reductions in mercury, a toxic metal, as well as smog-forming nitrogen and 
sulfur oxides.

However, a provision to reduce carbon dioxide, a gas implicated in global 
warming, was dropped under industry pressure.

Power companies that reduce beyond their limits could sell emission credits, 
which represent a pound of pollution, to companies that exceed their limits.

Although industry and free-market advocates favor such programs, they are not 
without controversy. The record of market-driven programs is mixed. On the 
one hand, the nation's acid rain program uses marketable permits and is 
widely credited with cutting sulfur oxides at less cost. On the other hand, 
the world's first market-driven program to tackle urban smog has not worked 
in Los Angeles, where nearly 400 power companies and manufacturers failed to 
achieve significant cleanup for the nearly eight years the program has been 
in effect.

Further, many environmental groups are wary of market-driven programs because 
by design they preclude active government intervention. Critics say such 
programs could potentially limit public review of power plant operations, 
allow emissions to concentrate in poor communities and slow efforts to cut 
haze in national parks downwind from plants that elect to buy pollution 
credits instead of cleaning up.

The Bush administration's power plant strategy was aired before the Senate 
Environment and Public Works Committee, which is chaired by Sen. James M. 
Jeffords (I-Vt.), whose dramatic departure from the GOP threw control of the 
Senate to the Democrats. Jeffords is proposing legislation, different from 
the administration's approach, that would control four power plant 
pollutants, including the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, an approach rejected 
by the Bush administration.

Prospects appear to be increasing that Congress will pass one or more 
measures designed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, a belated response to 
this week's decision by more than 180 countries to deal with the problem 
without the involvement of the United States.

Indeed, in recent weeks several members in the GOP-led House and Democratic 
Senate have voted on bills with the intention of disassociating themselves 
from President Bush's environmental policies before the next election.

Among the votes, the House struck down a provision supported by the Bush 
administration that could hinder progress on global climate change policy.

The Senate banned new coal mining and oil and gas drilling in national 
monuments. Other recent rebuffs included rejections of administration 
initiatives on such issues as the Endangered Species Act, hard-rock mining 
regulations and offshore drilling for oil and gas.

Federal Caps Didn't Deter Higher Prices
Power: Cal-ISO study says suppliers continued to charge as much as five times 
more than the imposed limits.
By NANCY VOGEL
TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 27 2001

SACRAMENTO -- After federal regulators limited wholesale electricity prices 
last month, big private sellers of power in California continued to ask as 
much as five times more for electricity than the federal cap, according to a 
confidential study by state grid operators.

The analysis by the California Independent System Operator covers only the 
first week after the caps were imposed June 20. Cal-ISO has submitted the 
data to federal regulators for potential investigation. The report is a 
summary of what Cal-ISO calls possible anti-competitive behavior by Duke 
Energy, Williams Cos., Mirant Corp., Reliant Energy and Dynegy Corp.

""In a truly competitive market we would expect these suppliers to bid very 
close to their actual operating cost,"" said Greg Cook, senior policy analyst 
with Cal-ISO's Department of Market Analysis. The state did not necessarily 
purchase any power at the high prices being demanded. Instead, the 
significance of the bids is that they show how California could find itself 
paying exorbitant prices for electricity again if hot weather returns and 
conservation slackens, said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who 
studies the California electricity market.

""The bottom line is that the generators are putting out these bids in 
expectation of high demand,"" he said. ""If weather all of a sudden gets really 
hot from Southern to Northern California, the bids submitted by generators 
could be very costly to California.""

Cal-ISO calculated the cost of production for each company based on the 
efficiency of its power plants and estimates of what each paid for natural 
gas to fuel the plants.

The average cost for the five was $105 per megawatt-hour, which closely 
matches the federal price limit in California, which now stands at $101 per 
megawatt-hour. According to the power bidding procedures, companies that bid 
at or below their cost of production often still get paid a higher price, 
allowing them to make a substantial profit.

On average, four of the five companies submitted bids either slightly below 
or slightly above their cost of production. But with the exception of 
Atlanta-based Mirant, each company at times submitted bids that were 
substantially higher. Houston-based Reliant, for example, bid as much as $540 
per megawatt-hour, more than five times its estimated cost. Overall, 
Reliant's average bid was close to costs, according to the analysis.

Cal-ISO identified companies by code in its report. Sources familiar with the 
study identified the companies for The Times.

The Cal-ISO report singled out ""Supplier 5,"" identified by sources as 
Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Energy, saying the company ""continues to bid 
significantly in excess of its operating costs.""

Duke owns two large power plants on the central coast. It marked up its bids 
an average of 88% beyond its cost to produce electricity, according to the 
analysis. For example, it cost Duke $85 to $121 to generate a megawatt-hour 
of electricity in the time period studied, the report shows, but the company 
offered to sell a megawatt-hour from $149 to $195.

Duke spokesman Tom Williams on Thursday said, ""The use of the data in some 
cases doesn't appear to add up and in all cases appears to be selective and 
could easily be misunderstood."" Duke sells nearly the entire output of its 
power plants under long-term contracts, and not on the spot market, which the 
Cal-ISO report studied, he noted.

Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley said, ""We're looking at the data, and we 
question whether or not it is correct.""

A combination of cool weather, heavy conservation, the start-up of new power 
plants and recently signed long-term power contracts that guarantee supplies 
have eased the state's electricity crisis in recent weeks.

Market prices that as recently as May averaged $271 per megawatt-hour have 
dropped to less than $100 per megawatt-hour.

The more abundant power supplies have freed grid operators to ignore 
higher-priced bids. But they will have to consider paying such prices to 
avoid blackouts if supplies tighten, Wolak said.

Such a scenario would test the effectiveness of the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission order issued June 19, he said.

The bids of the five companies analyzed were offers of sales to Cal-ISO, a 
Folsom-based agency that manages the electrical transmission grid serving 75% 
of California. Cal-ISO buys power on short notice to smooth the flow on the 
state's electrical freeway and avert blackouts.

As California's fledgling market began to go haywire last fall, Cal-ISO 
workers struggled to purchase as much as 30% of the state's power demand with 
just hours to spare. Since then, the market has stabilized, and Cal-ISO's 
purchases now amount to roughly 5% of the electricity California consumes.

Calpine profits double on skyrocketing sales 
Escalating power prices inspire plant building program

Fueled by high electricity prices, power generator Calpine Corp. reported 
strong second-quarter results yesterday. 
Calpine of San Jose said profit for the quarter ended June 30 almost doubled 
to $107.7 million (32 cents per share) from $59.5 million (20 cents) during 
the year-ago quarter. Revenue almost quadrupled to $1.61 billion from $417.2 
million a year ago. 
Excluding charges related to the acquisition of Canada's Encal Energy, 
Calpine's net income was $132.2 million (39 cents), well above the 31 cents 
per share predicted by analysts, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. 
Calpine is on an ambitious path to expand its roster of generating plants. By 
the end of 2005, it expects to have 75,000 megawatts in operation in the 
United States, including 12,000 megawatts in California. A megawatt is about 
enough power for 1,000 homes. 
The company, which generates 2,428 megawatts in California, this summer 
opened the state's first two major power plants in a decade. The new plants 
in Yuba City (Sutter County) and Pittsburg generate 547 and 555 megawatts, 
respectively. 
Combined with a new plant in Arizona that sells power to California, 
Calpine's new facilities helped the state stave off threatened blackouts this 
summer, Chief Executive Officer Peter Cartwright said. 
Calpine is building the 847-megawatt Delta Energy Center in Pittsburg, 
scheduled to open in May, and a 750-megawatt plant in Kern County, due in 
June 2003. 
It is also awaiting an August decision by the California Energy Commission on 
its proposed 600-megawatt Metcalf Energy Center in San Jose. 
""California is a very good market for us,"" said Bill Highlander, a Calpine 
spokesman. ""The pricing in California has benefited Calpine."" 
However, he said, the company was not one of the traders that focused on 
making top dollar in California's volatile spot market, because its business 
model concentrated on selling electricity through long-term contracts. 
During the past few months, Calpine signed 10-year and 20-year contracts with 
the state for as much as 2,500 megawatts, at prices ranging from $58.60 to 
$73 per megawatt hour. 
With most of its plants fired by natural gas, Calpine wants to control about 
a quarter of the gas it uses, Highlander said. Its April purchase of Encal 
Energy for $1.77 billion more than doubled its gas reserves, to about 1. 7 
trillion cubic feet equivalent, according to Hoover's Online. 
Calpine's stock closed up $1.08 at $36.89 yesterday.

Generators continue to set high electricity prices

(07-27) 00:59 PDT LOS ANGELES (AP) -- 
Power wholesalers continued to demand higher prices for energy despite 
federal regulation that capped electricity rates, according to a confidential 
report by the California Independent System Operator. 
In one case, an energy company charged as much as five times more for 
electricity than the federal cap, which were imposed June 20. State grid 
operators have given the study to federal regulators for a possible 
investigation, the Los Angeles Times reported Friday. 
Five companies were identified by code in the report and sources familiar 
with the study named the wholesalers for the Times. They include Duke Energy, 
Dynegy Corp., Mirant Corp., Reliant Corp., and Williams Cos. 
The average price charged by the five power companies was $105 per 
megawatt-hour, which closely matches the federal price limit in California 
set at $101 per megawatt-hour. 
Four of the five companies submitted bids either just below or just above 
their cost of production. Houston-based Reliant, however, asked as much as 
$540 per megawatt-hour in some cases. Overall, the company's average bid was 
close to costs, the report said. 
The state wasn't required to purchase power at the rates set by wholesalers 
but the bids reflect a potential repeat of charging exorbitant electricity 
prices if temperatures soar and conservation dwindles, said Frank Wolak, a 
Stanford University economist who studies the California electricity market. 
""The bottom line is that the generators are putting out these bids in 
expectation of high demand,"" he said. ""If weather all of a sudden gets really

THE ENERGY CRUNCH 
Environmental suit against power plant 
Expansion called danger to slough

MN236840.DTL>
An environmental group filed suit yesterday to overturn a permit granted to 
Duke Energy Co. to expand a major power plant south of Santa Cruz. 
Saying the permit was illegally awarded, the suit warns that the resulting 
project will damage the ecologically important Elkorn Slough. 
Voices of the Wetlands accuses the board that awarded the permit of violating 
federal law by not requiring Duke to use the best possible technology to 
minimize impacts on the environment around the Moss Landing power plant. 
If plans to expand the plant proceed without change, the group said, it would 
kill off critical organisms at the bottom of the food chain. 
The suit, filed in Monterey County against the California State Water 
Resources Control Board and the regional board that serves the central coast, 
seeks a court order to return the case to the regional water district so that 
more environmentally sensitive cooling technology can be ordered for use at 
the plant. 
State officials said yesterday that the issues raised in the suit were 
considered and rejected during the initial permit approval process last year, 
and again during the appeal process this year. 
The case comes amid enormous pressure on state officials, in light of 
California's energy crisis, to rapidly accelerate power plant approvals and 
expand the amount of power generation available. 
Against this backdrop, the state water board on June 21 essentially rejected 
environmental groups' appeal that had sought to overturn the district board's 
decision approving the Moss Landing expansion permit. 
On another front, board members of the California Energy Commission took 
testimony earlier this week on a proposal to curtail public review of plant 
project proposals, with one board member, Robert A. Laurie, acknowledging in 
an interview that he believed ""in some cases"" it posed one of the most time- 
consuming aspects of project approval. A recommendation is expected within 
the next month. 
Duke, of Charlotte, N.C., bought the Moss Landing plant from Pacific Gas & 
Electric Co. in 1998, when the Northern California utility sold off many of 
its facilities to prepare for deregulation of the energy market. 
The plant was built in 1950 using a cooling system technology that sucks 
water out of the Elkorn Slough and Monterey Bay to cool generating turbines 
before spitting the water out into the Pacific Ocean. 
The group says wildlife conditions and sea otter population have improved 
markedly since PG&E mothballed many of the generating units at Moss Landing 
in 1995. 
But Duke now is proposing to resurrect parts of the cooling system in a major 
expansion that will make Moss Landing the state's largest power plant after 
its completion next summer. 
With an output of 2,538 megawatts, the plant when completed is expected to 
account for 30 percent of all new electricity generated in California next 
year, serving about 2.5 million households in the Monterey, Santa Cruz and 
southern Santa Clara County areas, including San Jose. 
Regional water quality board officials declined comment yesterday, citing the 
pending litigation. But in public documents filed yesterday, water officials 
said cooling alternatives had been considered and rejected. The documents did 
not elaborate on why they were not mandated. 
Duke had acknowledged during the process that more ecologically sensitive 
technologies were available, but at prohibitive costs of $20 million to $50 
million more. 
Deborah Sivas, an attorney for the Earthjustice Environmental Law Clinic, 
which filed the suit on behalf of Voices of the Wetlands, considered the best 
technology alternatives mandatory, not optional. She said the board had not 
considered alternative approaches in reaching its conclusions.

Let's make a real deal with Edison 
July 27, 2001 
By JONATHAN LANSNER
The Orange County Register 
When any government official tries to play business executive, it's time to 
get nervous. Take the Edison bail out as evidence. 
At its essence, the deal works like this: Taxpayers give the utility a big 
pile of cash; the state gets some old, rickety transmission lines in return. 
Don't be fooled: The power bounty is basically a political ploy. 
The state doesn't need to control electric distribution. What politicos need 
is a face-saving trade as evidence that this is a business deal - not a 
government handout. The state probably should just write the check and eat 
its losses. But if bureaucrats wanted real remuneration from this bail out, 
California would eye some juicy Edison assets. 
As a public service, I'll list a few. Now, for argument's sake, I won't 
differentiate between the utility and its parent company, Edison 
International. Hey, lawyers built those walls between the two. Let 'em figure 
out how to take 'em down. 
For starters, you'd figure an energy-strapped state would like some regional 
power plants, no? Like the San Onofre facility. However, it might be 
laughable to see Sacramento-types defending their future handling of the 
local nuclear plant. 
OK, if that's a tad too dicey for the state, how about a coal-fired plant in 
Nevada? Heck, Edison had a buyer at half a billion bucks before the state 
oddly quashed that deal. Maybe the state could grab it from Edison -- then 
flip it to pay off electricity-related debts. 
Of course, buying one of the out-of-town power plants that Edison's sister 
company in Irvine has acquired might be educational for Sacramento. Owning a 
plant in Illinois or Pennsylvania or possibly New Zealand might show state 
honchos how easy - or not - it is to rig supply and prices. 
Alternatively, the state could demand a small entity called Edison Capital. 
Basically, it's a bank. One specialty: the politically correct field of 
affordable-housing lending. A good fit for bureaucrats. 
Speaking of money, there's the Edison pension plan. Governments are really 
good at running retirement benefits. Heck, California already has a huge one. 
There's got to be some economies of scale - real cash savings - in merging 
the Edison plan with some state pension fund. 
Do note that Edison's plan might be overfunded by about $400 million. You can 
bet, though, that the state would never have the nerve to play 1980s 
corporate raider: profiting by grabbing some of a company's overfunded 
retirement kitty. 
Finally, there's Edison International Field in Anaheim. Stadium naming-rights 
contracts must have some value since corporations always seem to fight over 
these promotional gimmicks. (The utility's parent company paid $50 million in 
1997 for two decades of ""free"" publicity.) 
Imagine the buzz the state could get out of the huge sign age on a nationally 
renowned stadium. Plus, maybe the Angels could be good corporate citizens and 
tie into this deal. 
It's possible they'd allow a slight change in the team name to better 
emphasize the state's role in the ballpark. So, how does ""California Angels"" 
sound to you?

California Sempra Continues Improved Results

Sempra Energy on Thursday reported another quarter of higher earnings and 
revenue, a sharp contrast to California 's bigger and beleaguered 
investor-owned utilities. 
Although California 's electricity crisis has pushed Southern California 
Edison and Pacific Gas & Electricity into insolvency--and PG&E into U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court--the parent of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern 
California Gas continues to post improved results on the strength of its 
non-utility businesses. 
Net income for the period ended June 30 rose 25% to $137 million, or 66 cents 
a share, up $25 million, or 55 cents, earned a year ago, the San Diego-based 
utility holding company said. Revenue jumped 40% to $2.1 billion. Pretax 
operating income rose 24% to $291 million. 
Sempra's earnings came in just ahead of the 65-cent average estimate of 
analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
""Our strong second-quarter performance is primarily the result of our efforts 
to accelerate growth through new businesses,"" Stephen L. Baum, Sempra's 
chairman, chief executive and president, told analysts in a conference call. 
Sempra is in a vastly different position than Edison International and PG&E 
Corp. because its electric utility arm was able to avoid the deep financial 
woes afflicting their respective Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & 
Electric utilities. 
SDG&E was first to sell its power plants two years ago and thus was freed 
from a rate freeze. That in turn allowed the utility to pass along to 
customers the soaring costs of electricity beginning last summer. The state 
Legislature eventually rolled back and capped the rates for SDG&E customers, 
but promised the utility it would be allowed to recover those losses. 
Edison and PG&E, however, continued to accumulate staggering debts because 
their retail rate freezes remained in place. 
In contrast, Sempra is solvent, with $1.5 billion in cash and $1 billion in 
available credit, Baum said. 
The performance of its utilities was lackluster, with Southern California Gas 
earning $47 million, unchanged from the second quarter of 2000, and SDG&E 
earning $37 million, down from $40 million in the year-ago period. But 
Sempra's unregulated businesses--including energy trading, power plant 
construction and operation, international electricity operations and energy 
services--turned in an overall strong performance, contributing 39% of the 
parent company's earnings. 
Sempra's trading unit provided most of that profit, contributing $69 million 
to second-quarter net income compared with $40 million in the same quarter 
last year. 
Sempra's stock gained 17 cents to close at $25.49 on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

California Calpine Doubles Earnings, Beats Forecasts Energy: San Jose-based 
company credits higher electricity prices in California and sales from new 
plants.

Calpine Corp., one of the biggest U.S. power-plant builders, said Thursday 
that second-quarter earnings more than doubled, beating estimates, because of 
higher electricity prices in California and sales from new plants. 
Profit from operations rose to $132.2 million, or 39 cents a share, from net 
income of $59.5 million, or 20 cents, a year earlier. Revenue almost 
quadrupled to $1.61 billion. 
San Jose-based Calpine opened plants in the U.S. with a combined capacity of 
1,545 megawatts--enough to light 1.5 million average homes--and benefited 
from existing plants in California . Calpine has insulated itself from rising 
fuel costs by buying natural-gas fields to supply its plants. 
""Given the strategy they have chosen, they're following through quite well,"" 
said Andre Meade, an analyst at Commerzbank Capital Markets Co. ""They are 
growing from a small base and adding a lot of plants, so we'd expect high 
growth."" 
Profit topped the 31-cent average estimate of analysts surveyed by First 
Call/Thomson Financial. Calpine said it expects to earn $2 a share this year. 
The average First Call forecast was $1.92, with a range of $1.80 to $2.04. 
Calpine's shares rose $1.08, or 3%, to close at $36.89 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
The shares had fallen 21% this year amid concern that generators might have 
to give back some of the profit they made selling power in California during 
the last year. In addition, cooler-than-normal weather and conservation 
efforts recently reduced power prices in the state. 
Calpine runs or is building natural gas plants in 29 U.S. states and Canada 
that produce more than 30,000 megawatts of power. The company plans to more 
than double capacity to 70,000 megawatts by the end of 2005. 
Calpine this month opened the $350-million Sutter plant, California 's first 
major generator in more than a decade. The company is building 11 plants to 
run during times of peak demand in the state and getting permits for four 
more, James Macias, who oversees Calpine's West Coast power plants, said in a 
conference call with analysts and investors. 
Separately, Arlington, Va.-based AES Corp., a power producer that supplies 
California and operates in 27 countries, said second-quarter profit fell 20% 
because of losses tied to currency fluctuations and the sale of a U.S. 
electricity retailer. 
Net income fell to $112 million, or 21 cents a share, from $140 million, or 
28 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 26% to $2.21 billion.

Calpine Net Soars
On Added Plants;
Sempra Profit Rises
By Rebecca Smith

Calpine Corp. reported net income nearly doubled in the second quarter, 
reflecting the independent power producer's aggressive plant-building 
program. Meanwhile, the parent of a San Diego utility said profit rose 25%. 
Calpine, of San Jose, Calif., said net was $107.7 million, or 32 cents a 
share, up from $59.5 million, or 20 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest 
results, which were in line with analysts' expectations, included a special 
charge of seven cents a share related to Calpine's purchase of Encal Energy 
Ltd., a natural-gas company. Revenue grew even more strongly, soaring to 
$1.61 billion from $417.2 million. 
Separately, Sempra Energy, parent of electric utility San Diego Gas & 
Electric, reported profit rose to $137 million from $110 million a year 
earlier. Revenue jumped 40% to $2.1 billion from $1.5 billion. Sempra 
Chairman Steve Baum attributed the growth, which stands in marked contrast to 
the financial woes of California 's other electric-utility-owning energy 
companies, to Sempra's unregulated operations. 
Calpine's profit increased despite paying substantially more for natural gas 
to fuel its plants. It spent an average of $4.80 per million British Thermal 
Units for natural gas, up from $3.31 a year before. At the same time, 
Calpine's revenue per megawatt hour of electricity sold also rose, to $71.03 
in the latest period from $64.80 a year earlier. 
At Sempra, Mr. Baum said profit from Sempra's biggest utility unit, San Diego 
Gas & Electric, fell 7.5% to $37 million from $40 million. Results were flat 
at its gas-distribution company, Southern California Gas Co. Sempra Energy 
Trading was the big profit center, generating half its total profit, or $69 
million, compared with $40 million a year earlier. 
Mr. Baum said Sempra's stock, which trades at a low price/earnings multiple

also said the company made less money in spot-power markets than in prior 
quarters but nevertheless intends to invest $2 billion in new power plants.

Gray Davis by a mid-August deadline. A group of legislators and Davis staffers has worked this week on an agreement that would restore Southern California Edison's credit and relieve the state of having to purchase energy for the utility. Assembly leaders, who convened the group, set an ambitious schedule that would have led to a vote today had they reached consensus and been able to recall enough of the 80 Assembly members from summer recess destinations. But the newly formed plan, which would issue $2.9 billion in consumer-backed bonds in exchange for several Edison concessions, remains too rough for a vote, said Paul Hefner, a spokesman for Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks. Hefner was quick to note that Hertzberg has the Assembly ""on call"" for the scheduled monthlong break and is prepared to ask members to return if a deal comes in the next three weeks. But staff and lawmakers said earlier that organizing a mass return after today would prove nearly impossible because Assembly members are expected to travel throughout the state and beyond. Davis set an Aug. 15 deadline in his original Edison deal and recently said he could call a special session forcing legislators to return if they do not authorize a plan by then. His spokesman, Steven Maviglio, said Thursday the governor is not ruling out that idea but is waiting to see what comes of further legislative discussions. ""It's pretty clear that everyone's working pretty hard to form a consensus, but they're just not there,"" Maviglio said. ""The governor is optimistic about the Aug. 15 date."" Even so, Edison does not expect a solution by then. Company officials stated earlier this week that they would wait for a political deal at least until lawmakers return Aug. 20.

Rose UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER July 27, 2001 Sempra Energy, the parent company of SDG&E, reported a 25 percent surge in profit to $137 million last quarter but said yesterday it lost money on the sale of electricity under a long-term contract to California. On the other hand, Sempra said its largest source of profits was its energy trading unit, a middleman that earned $69 million during the quarter buying and selling energy produced by others. The results underscore the transformation of relatively simple utility companies into diversified energy holding companies that have learned to profit in new ways from the deregulation of electricity and the turmoil in energy markets. The surprising announcement -- that a company lost money selling power during California's run-up in electricity prices -- was explained by Sempra as an intentional consequence of the long-term contract it signed with the state to provide power. Stephen Baum, chairman and chief executive officer of Sempra, said the company agreed to provide a steep discount to California during the summer months but would recoup the losses later in the 10-year deal. California sought long-term electricity purchase contracts so it could reduce its purchases in daily and near-term power markets, where prices reached record levels. Critics say Gov. Gray Davis rushed into long-term deals because of concerns about getting through next year's election. They also say the contracts will saddle customers with higher costs for years. The governor has acknowledged that long-term contracts might cause consumers to pay relatively high prices for electricity in later years, but he maintains it is a fair price to pay for lowering prices that were devastating the state economy. Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, said the steep discount Sempra provided to the state on power this summer raised questions about the governor's proposal to help San Diego Gas & Electric Co. clear a debt of $750 million. SDG&E says it is owed that money for power purchases on behalf of its customers. In a media conference last month, Davis said the agreement would eliminate the threat of a possible balloon payment for consumers, who he said might have faced the so-called balancing account debt as early as next year. Shames says the proposal, which took the form of a memorandum of understanding, or MOU, is costly for consumers and a bonanza for Sempra. He said the relatively cheap power provided by Sempra this summer ""makes the MOU sound like more of a hidden payback to Sempra than a real relief plan for local ratepayers."" Shames said he will release an analysis of the state's Sempra plan next week. The state Public Utilities Commission is expected to rule on the plan in August. A Sempra spokesman said there is no connection between discount power and the tentative agreement to clear the $750 million debt. Doug Kline, the Sempra spokesman, said the power contract with the state was signed in early May and the agreement on the balancing account was reached in mid-June. Sempra Energy Trading, meanwhile, said only 10 percent of its $69 million profit was earned from sales of energy in the western region, which includes California. The trading operation earned $40 million in profit during the comparable period last year. California's Independent System Operator, which manages most of the state power grid, and other investigators have said trading and bidding strategies were tools used by energy companies to raise prices during the California power crisis. Though Sempra earned money on trading, its wholesale power generating business lost $9 million during the quarter. Baum said the discounts on electricity provided the state were the prime cause of the loss for Sempra Energy Resources but added that a plant outage also contributed. Sempra Energy Resources, which co-owns a generating plant near Las Vegas with Reliant Energy, earned $2 million during the second quarter last year. Baum added that Sempra's long-term contract with the state -- under which it will provide up to 1,900 megawatts -- has allowed its wholesale business to pre-sell about half the power it expects to generate from the Nevada plant, which will be expanded, and three generating facilities it expects to build. Profits at SDG&E slipped to $37 million during the quarter ended June 30, down from $40 million last year, according to Sempra. SDG&E, whose business is restricted to delivering gas and electricity, said it provided increased customer service during the crisis, which lowered profits. Wall Street analysts generally applauded Sempra's results, noting that the company was ahead of its plan to generate at least a third of its profits from its newer businesses by 2003. ""They're really two years ahead of schedule for their non-utility businesses,"" said Brian Youngberg, an analyst with Edward Jones & Co. Bud Leedom, a San Diego-based analyst with Wells Fargo Van Kasper, said Sempra's move into energy trading now seems shrewd. ""We never dreamed they were setting themselves for a windfall like this,"" Leedom said. Investors pushed Sempra shares up 17 cents yesterday, to close at $25.49 in trading on The New York Stock Exchange. Bloomberg news service contributed to this report. Smog Rules May Be Eased Power plants: EPA proposes a sweeping change in how utilities' emissions are curbed, a flexible approach favored by the industry. By GARY POLAKOVIC and ELIZABETH SHOGREN Times Staff Writers July 27 2001 WASHINGTON -- U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Christie Whitman proposed sweeping changes Thursday in the regulation of power plant pollution that would replace five of the government's toughest programs with a single, flexible approach favored by utilities. Whitman outlined a plan for cleaning up major components of power plant smog that represents a significant departure from the EPA's traditional regulatory dictums. She called for a major expansion of pollution credit trading, which, up to now, has had varying success. Under the new plan, the EPA would scrap some of the most stringent measures devised by the agency to deal with power plant emissions. One provision to be set aside aims to cut harmful mercury emissions; another is meant to reduce emissions from Midwestern power plants by 85%; another is designed to restore visibility at national parks. Especially unpopular with industry, one measure, known as new source review, requires the installation of advanced pollution controls whenever power plants are expanded or modified. It too would be phased out. ""New source review is certainly one of those regulatory aspects that would no longer be necessary,"" Whitman told Sen. George Voinovich (R-Ohio) at the hearing by the Environment and Public Works Committee. ""All of those [programs] could be aligned into one regulatory process"" that she said would work better than existing rules. Whitman's comments offer the first peek into the administration's plans for cleaning some of the dirtiest polluters left in the nation. Debate over the administration's clean-air approach has shifted to Congress as it considers whether to revise the national Clean Air Act. The magnitude of the proposed revisions caught environmentalists by surprise but buoyed industry representatives who say existing controls are costly and inefficient. ""She has raised an appalling prospect of junking virtually every rule and strategy to deal with emissions of electric companies in return for some vague industry-sought plan for an emissions trading scheme,"" said Frank O'Donnell, executive director of the Clean Air Trust, an environmental advocacy group. ""If they go forward with this, it means a wholesale fight over the Clean Air Act in Congress."" After the hearing, Whitman stressed that the overall goal is to clean the air more efficiently than current rules do. Although the administration has not yet released a so-called multipollutant cleanup strategy, Whitman contended that collapsing several regulations into one far-reaching approach would be easier for regulators and industry to manage. ""What we're looking for is targets under this legislation that significantly clean up the air beyond what our current regulatory, statutory requirements would do,"" Whitman said. She added that new source review, for example, ""could potentially be no longer necessary if you have the right kind of targets set in a multi-emissions bill. We have to wait and see where the targets are set."" Utilities have lobbied Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force to prevent the EPA from aggressively enforcing the new source review regulation. Industry and administration officials say the provision is onerous and prevents plant upgrades, although EPA officials say it is a key tool for forcing dirty, old plants to cut emissions by up to 95%. During the Clinton administration, federal officials charged that 32 coal-fired power plants in several Southern and Midwestern states ignored a requirement that companies install advanced emission controls when their plants were upgraded. The government reached settlement with three utilities, but a provision in the Bush administration's energy plan stalled those enforcement actions pending a review of power plant controls. C. Boyden Gray, attorney for the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council and former White House counsel for the first President Bush in the 1980s, praised the administration's proposal. He said major utility companies he represents, including Southern Co., Duke Energy Co. and the Tennessee Valley Authority, could clean up with greater flexibility and less cost under the plan outlined by Whitman. ""To put everything in a market-incentives basis is a great step. It would be a real breakthrough and a plus for the business community,"" Gray said. For example, Gray said EPA has four separate measures to control nitrogen oxides from power plant combustion, including programs to cut acid rain, ozone and haze. Another program scheduled to take effect in May 2004 requires power plants in 19 states to cut summer emissions by 1 million tons annually. He said those programs can be confusing and costly and could easily be replaced by a credit-trading program run largely by power companies. Under the program being considered by the Bush administration, an emission limit could be established at hundreds of power plants followed by annual reductions in mercury, a toxic metal, as well as smog-forming nitrogen and sulfur oxides. However, a provision to reduce carbon dioxide, a gas implicated in global warming, was dropped under industry pressure. Power companies that reduce beyond their limits could sell emission credits, which represent a pound of pollution, to companies that exceed their limits. Although industry and free-market advocates favor such programs, they are not without controversy. The record of market-driven programs is mixed. On the one hand, the nation's acid rain program uses marketable permits and is widely credited with cutting sulfur oxides at less cost. On the other hand, the world's first market-driven program to tackle urban smog has not worked in Los Angeles, where nearly 400 power companies and manufacturers failed to achieve significant cleanup for the nearly eight years the program has been in effect. Further, many environmental groups are wary of market-driven programs because by design they preclude active government intervention. Critics say such programs could potentially limit public review of power plant operations, allow emissions to concentrate in poor communities and slow efforts to cut haze in national parks downwind from plants that elect to buy pollution credits instead of cleaning up. The Bush administration's power plant strategy was aired before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which is chaired by Sen. James M. Jeffords (I-Vt.), whose dramatic departure from the GOP threw control of the Senate to the Democrats. Jeffords is proposing legislation, different from the administration's approach, that would control four power plant pollutants, including the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, an approach rejected by the Bush administration. Prospects appear to be increasing that Congress will pass one or more measures designed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, a belated response to this week's decision by more than 180 countries to deal with the problem without the involvement of the United States. Indeed, in recent weeks several members in the GOP-led House and Democratic Senate have voted on bills with the intention of disassociating themselves from President Bush's environmental policies before the next election. Among the votes, the House struck down a provision supported by the Bush administration that could hinder progress on global climate change policy. The Senate banned new coal mining and oil and gas drilling in national monuments. Other recent rebuffs included rejections of administration initiatives on such issues as the Endangered Species Act, hard-rock mining regulations and offshore drilling for oil and gas. Copyright 2001, Los Angeles Times <http://www.latimes.com> Federal Caps Didn't Deter Higher Prices Power: Cal-ISO study says suppliers continued to charge as much as five times more than the imposed limits. By NANCY VOGEL TIMES STAFF WRITER July 27 2001 SACRAMENTO -- After federal regulators limited wholesale electricity prices last month, big private sellers of power in California continued to ask as much as five times more for electricity than the federal cap, according to a confidential study by state grid operators. The analysis by the California Independent System Operator covers only the first week after the caps were imposed June 20. Cal-ISO has submitted the data to federal regulators for potential investigation. The report is a summary of what Cal-ISO calls possible anti-competitive behavior by Duke Energy, Williams Cos., Mirant Corp., Reliant Energy and Dynegy Corp. ""In a truly competitive market we would expect these suppliers to bid very close to their actual operating cost,"" said Greg Cook, senior policy analyst with Cal-ISO's Department of Market Analysis. The state did not necessarily purchase any power at the high prices being demanded. Instead, the significance of the bids is that they show how California could find itself paying exorbitant prices for electricity again if hot weather returns and conservation slackens, said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who studies the California electricity market. ""The bottom line is that the generators are putting out these bids in expectation of high demand,"" he said. ""If weather all of a sudden gets really hot from Southern to Northern California, the bids submitted by generators could be very costly to California."" Cal-ISO calculated the cost of production for each company based on the efficiency of its power plants and estimates of what each paid for natural gas to fuel the plants. The average cost for the five was $105 per megawatt-hour, which closely matches the federal price limit in California, which now stands at $101 per megawatt-hour. According to the power bidding procedures, companies that bid at or below their cost of production often still get paid a higher price, allowing them to make a substantial profit. On average, four of the five companies submitted bids either slightly below or slightly above their cost of production. But with the exception of Atlanta-based Mirant, each company at times submitted bids that were substantially higher. Houston-based Reliant, for example, bid as much as $540 per megawatt-hour, more than five times its estimated cost. Overall, Reliant's average bid was close to costs, according to the analysis. Cal-ISO identified companies by code in its report. Sources familiar with the study identified the companies for The Times. The Cal-ISO report singled out ""Supplier 5,"" identified by sources as Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Energy, saying the company ""continues to bid significantly in excess of its operating costs."" Duke owns two large power plants on the central coast. It marked up its bids an average of 88% beyond its cost to produce electricity, according to the analysis. For example, it cost Duke $85 to $121 to generate a megawatt-hour of electricity in the time period studied, the report shows, but the company offered to sell a megawatt-hour from $149 to $195. Duke spokesman Tom Williams on Thursday said, ""The use of the data in some cases doesn't appear to add up and in all cases appears to be selective and could easily be misunderstood."" Duke sells nearly the entire output of its power plants under long-term contracts, and not on the spot market, which the Cal-ISO report studied, he noted. Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley said, ""We're looking at the data, and we question whether or not it is correct."" A combination of cool weather, heavy conservation, the start-up of new power plants and recently signed long-term power contracts that guarantee supplies have eased the state's electricity crisis in recent weeks. Market prices that as recently as May averaged $271 per megawatt-hour have dropped to less than $100 per megawatt-hour. The more abundant power supplies have freed grid operators to ignore higher-priced bids. But they will have to consider paying such prices to avoid blackouts if supplies tighten, Wolak said. Such a scenario would test the effectiveness of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission order issued June 19, he said. The bids of the five companies analyzed were offers of sales to Cal-ISO, a Folsom-based agency that manages the electrical transmission grid serving 75% of California. Cal-ISO buys power on short notice to smooth the flow on the state's electrical freeway and avert blackouts. As California's fledgling market began to go haywire last fall, Cal-ISO workers struggled to purchase as much as 30% of the state's power demand with just hours to spare. Since then, the market has stabilized, and Cal-ISO's purchases now amount to roughly 5% of the electricity California consumes.

Calpine of San Jose said profit for the quarter ended June 30 almost doubled to $107.7 million (32 cents per share) from $59.5 million (20 cents) during the year-ago quarter. Revenue almost quadrupled to $1.61 billion from $417.2 million a year ago. Excluding charges related to the acquisition of Canada's Encal Energy, Calpine's net income was $132.2 million (39 cents), well above the 31 cents per share predicted by analysts, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. Calpine is on an ambitious path to expand its roster of generating plants. By the end of 2005, it expects to have 75,000 megawatts in operation in the United States, including 12,000 megawatts in California. A megawatt is about enough power for 1,000 homes. The company, which generates 2,428 megawatts in California, this summer opened the state's first two major power plants in a decade. The new plants in Yuba City (Sutter County) and Pittsburg generate 547 and 555 megawatts, respectively. Combined with a new plant in Arizona that sells power to California, Calpine's new facilities helped the state stave off threatened blackouts this summer, Chief Executive Officer Peter Cartwright said. Calpine is building the 847-megawatt Delta Energy Center in Pittsburg, scheduled to open in May, and a 750-megawatt plant in Kern County, due in June 2003. It is also awaiting an August decision by the California Energy Commission on its proposed 600-megawatt Metcalf Energy Center in San Jose. ""California is a very good market for us,"" said Bill Highlander, a Calpine spokesman. ""The pricing in California has benefited Calpine."" However, he said, the company was not one of the traders that focused on making top dollar in California's volatile spot market, because its business model concentrated on selling electricity through long-term contracts. During the past few months, Calpine signed 10-year and 20-year contracts with the state for as much as 2,500 megawatts, at prices ranging from $58.60 to $73 per megawatt hour. With most of its plants fired by natural gas, Calpine wants to control about a quarter of the gas it uses, Highlander said. Its April purchase of Encal Energy for $1.77 billion more than doubled its gas reserves, to about 1. 7 trillion cubic feet equivalent, according to Hoover's Online. Calpine's stock closed up $1.08 at $36.89 yesterday.

In one case, an energy company charged as much as five times more for electricity than the federal cap, which were imposed June 20. State grid operators have given the study to federal regulators for a possible investigation, the Los Angeles Times reported Friday. Five companies were identified by code in the report and sources familiar with the study named the wholesalers for the Times. They include Duke Energy, Dynegy Corp., Mirant Corp., Reliant Corp., and Williams Cos. The average price charged by the five power companies was $105 per megawatt-hour, which closely matches the federal price limit in California set at $101 per megawatt-hour. Four of the five companies submitted bids either just below or just above their cost of production. Houston-based Reliant, however, asked as much as $540 per megawatt-hour in some cases. Overall, the company's average bid was close to costs, the report said. The state wasn't required to purchase power at the rates set by wholesalers but the bids reflect a potential repeat of charging exorbitant electricity prices if temperatures soar and conservation dwindles, said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who studies the California electricity market.

Saying the permit was illegally awarded, the suit warns that the resulting project will damage the ecologically important Elkorn Slough. Voices of the Wetlands accuses the board that awarded the permit of violating federal law by not requiring Duke to use the best possible technology to minimize impacts on the environment around the Moss Landing power plant. If plans to expand the plant proceed without change, the group said, it would kill off critical organisms at the bottom of the food chain. The suit, filed in Monterey County against the California State Water Resources Control Board and the regional board that serves the central coast, seeks a court order to return the case to the regional water district so that more environmentally sensitive cooling technology can be ordered for use at the plant. State officials said yesterday that the issues raised in the suit were considered and rejected during the initial permit approval process last year, and again during the appeal process this year. The case comes amid enormous pressure on state officials, in light of California's energy crisis, to rapidly accelerate power plant approvals and expand the amount of power generation available. Against this backdrop, the state water board on June 21 essentially rejected environmental groups' appeal that had sought to overturn the district board's decision approving the Moss Landing expansion permit. On another front, board members of the California Energy Commission took testimony earlier this week on a proposal to curtail public review of plant project proposals, with one board member, Robert A. Laurie, acknowledging in an interview that he believed ""in some cases"" it posed one of the most time- consuming aspects of project approval. A recommendation is expected within the next month. Duke, of Charlotte, N.C., bought the Moss Landing plant from Pacific Gas & Electric Co. in 1998, when the Northern California utility sold off many of its facilities to prepare for deregulation of the energy market. The plant was built in 1950 using a cooling system technology that sucks water out of the Elkorn Slough and Monterey Bay to cool generating turbines before spitting the water out into the Pacific Ocean. The group says wildlife conditions and sea otter population have improved markedly since PG&E mothballed many of the generating units at Moss Landing in 1995. But Duke now is proposing to resurrect parts of the cooling system in a major expansion that will make Moss Landing the state's largest power plant after its completion next summer. With an output of 2,538 megawatts, the plant when completed is expected to account for 30 percent of all new electricity generated in California next year, serving about 2.5 million households in the Monterey, Santa Cruz and southern Santa Clara County areas, including San Jose. Regional water quality board officials declined comment yesterday, citing the pending litigation. But in public documents filed yesterday, water officials said cooling alternatives had been considered and rejected. The documents did not elaborate on why they were not mandated. Duke had acknowledged during the process that more ecologically sensitive technologies were available, but at prohibitive costs of $20 million to $50 million more. Deborah Sivas, an attorney for the Earthjustice Environmental Law Clinic, which filed the suit on behalf of Voices of the Wetlands, considered the best technology alternatives mandatory, not optional. She said the board had not considered alternative approaches in reaching its conclusions.

Take the Edison bail out as evidence. At its essence, the deal works like this: Taxpayers give the utility a big pile of cash; the state gets some old, rickety transmission lines in return. Don't be fooled: The power bounty is basically a political ploy. The state doesn't need to control electric distribution. What politicos need is a face-saving trade as evidence that this is a business deal - not a government handout. The state probably should just write the check and eat its losses. But if bureaucrats wanted real remuneration from this bail out, California would eye some juicy Edison assets. As a public service, I'll list a few. Now, for argument's sake, I won't differentiate between the utility and its parent company, Edison International. Hey, lawyers built those walls between the two. Let 'em figure out how to take 'em down. For starters, you'd figure an energy-strapped state would like some regional power plants, no? Like the San Onofre facility. However, it might be laughable to see Sacramento-types defending their future handling of the local nuclear plant. OK, if that's a tad too dicey for the state, how about a coal-fired plant in Nevada? Heck, Edison had a buyer at half a billion bucks before the state oddly quashed that deal. Maybe the state could grab it from Edison -- then flip it to pay off electricity-related debts. Of course, buying one of the out-of-town power plants that Edison's sister company in Irvine has acquired might be educational for Sacramento. Owning a plant in Illinois or Pennsylvania or possibly New Zealand might show state honchos how easy - or not - it is to rig supply and prices. Alternatively, the state could demand a small entity called Edison Capital. Basically, it's a bank. One specialty: the politically correct field of affordable-housing lending. A good fit for bureaucrats. Speaking of money, there's the Edison pension plan. Governments are really good at running retirement benefits. Heck, California already has a huge one. There's got to be some economies of scale - real cash savings - in merging the Edison plan with some state pension fund. Do note that Edison's plan might be overfunded by about $400 million. You can bet, though, that the state would never have the nerve to play 1980s corporate raider: profiting by grabbing some of a company's overfunded retirement kitty. Finally, there's Edison International Field in Anaheim. Stadium naming-rights contracts must have some value since corporations always seem to fight over these promotional gimmicks. (The utility's parent company paid $50 million in 1997 for two decades of ""free"" publicity.) Imagine the buzz the state could get out of the huge sign age on a nationally renowned stadium. Plus, maybe the Angels could be good corporate citizens and tie into this deal. It's possible they'd allow a slight change in the team name to better emphasize the state's role in the ballpark. So, how does ""California Angels"" sound to you? Business; Financial Desk California Sempra Continues Improved Results NANCY RIVERA BROOKS 07/27/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page C-2 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company Sempra Energy on Thursday reported another quarter of higher earnings and revenue, a sharp contrast to California 's bigger and beleaguered investor-owned utilities. Although California 's electricity crisis has pushed Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electricity into insolvency--and PG&E into U.S. Bankruptcy Court--the parent of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas continues to post improved results on the strength of its non-utility businesses. Net income for the period ended June 30 rose 25% to $137 million, or 66 cents a share, up $25 million, or 55 cents, earned a year ago, the San Diego-based utility holding company said. Revenue jumped 40% to $2.1 billion. Pretax operating income rose 24% to $291 million. Sempra's earnings came in just ahead of the 65-cent average estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. ""Our strong second-quarter performance is primarily the result of our efforts to accelerate growth through new businesses,"" Stephen L. Baum, Sempra's chairman, chief executive and president, told analysts in a conference call. Sempra is in a vastly different position than Edison International and PG&E Corp. because its electric utility arm was able to avoid the deep financial woes afflicting their respective Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric utilities. SDG&E was first to sell its power plants two years ago and thus was freed from a rate freeze. That in turn allowed the utility to pass along to customers the soaring costs of electricity beginning last summer. The state Legislature eventually rolled back and capped the rates for SDG&E customers, but promised the utility it would be allowed to recover those losses. Edison and PG&E, however, continued to accumulate staggering debts because their retail rate freezes remained in place. In contrast, Sempra is solvent, with $1.5 billion in cash and $1 billion in available credit, Baum said. The performance of its utilities was lackluster, with Southern California Gas earning $47 million, unchanged from the second quarter of 2000, and SDG&E earning $37 million, down from $40 million in the year-ago period. But Sempra's unregulated businesses--including energy trading, power plant construction and operation, international electricity operations and energy services--turned in an overall strong performance, contributing 39% of the parent company's earnings. Sempra's trading unit provided most of that profit, contributing $69 million to second-quarter net income compared with $40 million in the same quarter last year. Sempra's stock gained 17 cents to close at $25.49 on the New York Stock Exchange. Business; Financial Desk California Calpine Doubles Earnings, Beats Forecasts Energy: San Jose-based company credits higher electricity prices in California and sales from new plants. 07/27/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page C-2 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company Calpine Corp., one of the biggest U.S. power-plant builders, said Thursday that second-quarter earnings more than doubled, beating estimates, because of higher electricity prices in California and sales from new plants. Profit from operations rose to $132.2 million, or 39 cents a share, from net income of $59.5 million, or 20 cents, a year earlier. Revenue almost quadrupled to $1.61 billion. San Jose-based Calpine opened plants in the U.S. with a combined capacity of 1,545 megawatts--enough to light 1.5 million average homes--and benefited from existing plants in California . Calpine has insulated itself from rising fuel costs by buying natural-gas fields to supply its plants. ""Given the strategy they have chosen, they're following through quite well,"" said Andre Meade, an analyst at Commerzbank Capital Markets Co. ""They are growing from a small base and adding a lot of plants, so we'd expect high growth."" Profit topped the 31-cent average estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. Calpine said it expects to earn $2 a share this year. The average First Call forecast was $1.92, with a range of $1.80 to $2.04. Calpine's shares rose $1.08, or 3%, to close at $36.89 on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares had fallen 21% this year amid concern that generators might have to give back some of the profit they made selling power in California during the last year. In addition, cooler-than-normal weather and conservation efforts recently reduced power prices in the state. Calpine runs or is building natural gas plants in 29 U.S. states and Canada that produce more than 30,000 megawatts of power. The company plans to more than double capacity to 70,000 megawatts by the end of 2005. Calpine this month opened the $350-million Sutter plant, California 's first major generator in more than a decade. The company is building 11 plants to run during times of peak demand in the state and getting permits for four more, James Macias, who oversees Calpine's West Coast power plants, said in a conference call with analysts and investors. Separately, Arlington, Va.-based AES Corp., a power producer that supplies California and operates in 27 countries, said second-quarter profit fell 20% because of losses tied to currency fluctuations and the sale of a U.S. electricity retailer. Net income fell to $112 million, or 21 cents a share, from $140 million, or 28 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 26% to $2.21 billion. California ; Metro Desk Cap No Bar to Higher Prices Power: Cal-ISO study says suppliers continued to charge as much as five times more than the U.S.-imposed limits. NANCY VOGEL 07/27/2001 Los Angeles Times Ventura County Edition Page B-1 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO -- After federal regulators limited wholesale electricity prices last month, big private sellers of power in California continued to ask as much as five times more for electricity than the federal cap, according to a confidential study by state grid operators. The analysis by the California Independent System Operator covers only the first week after the caps were imposed June 20. Cal-ISO has submitted the data to federal regulators for potential investigation. The report is a summary of what Cal-ISO calls possible anti-competitive behavior by Duke Energy, Williams Cos., Mirant Corp., Reliant Energy and Dynegy Corp. ""In a truly competitive market we would expect these suppliers to bid very close to their actual operating cost,"" said Greg Cook, senior policy analyst with Cal-ISO's Department of Market Analysis. The state did not necessarily purchase any power at the high prices being demanded. Instead, the significance of the bids is that they show how California could find itself paying exorbitant prices for electricity again if hot weather returns and conservation slackens, said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who studies the California electricity market. ""The bottom line is that the generators are putting out these bids in expectation of high demand,"" he said. ""If weather all of a sudden gets really hot from Southern to Northern California , the bids submitted by generators could be very costly to California ."" Cal-ISO calculated the cost of production for each company based on the efficiency of its power plants and estimates of what each paid for natural gas to fuel the plants. The average cost for the five was $105 per megawatt-hour, which closely matches the federal price limit in California , which now stands at $101 per megawatt-hour. According to the power bidding procedures, companies that bid at or below their cost of production often still get paid a higher price, allowing them to make a substantial profit. On average, four of the five companies submitted bids either slightly below or slightly above their cost of production. But with the exception of Atlanta-based Mirant, each company at times submitted bids that were substantially higher. Houston-based Reliant, for example, bid as much as $540 per megawatt-hour, more than five times its estimated cost. Overall, Reliant's average bid was close to costs, according to the analysis. Cal-ISO identified companies by code in its report. Sources familiar with the study identified the companies for The Times. The Cal-ISO report singled out ""Supplier 5,"" identified by sources as Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Energy, saying the company ""continues to bid significantly in excess of its operating costs."" Duke owns two large power plants on the central coast. It marked up its bids an average of 88% beyond its cost to produce electricity , according to the analysis. For example, it cost Duke $85 to $121 to generate a megawatt-hour of electricity in the time period studied, the report shows, but the company's bids ranged from $149 to $195 per megawatt-hour. Duke spokesman Tom Williams on Thursday said, ""The use of the data in some cases doesn't appear to add up and in all cases appears to be selective and could easily be misunderstood."" Duke sells nearly the entire output of its power plants under long-term contracts, and not on the spot market, which the Cal-ISO report studied, he noted. Calpine Net Soars On Added Plants; Sempra Profit Rises By Rebecca Smith 07/27/2001 The Wall Street Journal Page B4 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) Calpine Corp. reported net income nearly doubled in the second quarter, reflecting the independent power producer's aggressive plant-building program. Meanwhile, the parent of a San Diego utility said profit rose 25%. Calpine, of San Jose, Calif., said net was $107.7 million, or 32 cents a share, up from $59.5 million, or 20 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest results, which were in line with analysts' expectations, included a special charge of seven cents a share related to Calpine's purchase of Encal Energy Ltd., a natural-gas company. Revenue grew even more strongly, soaring to $1.61 billion from $417.2 million. Separately, Sempra Energy, parent of electric utility San Diego Gas & Electric, reported profit rose to $137 million from $110 million a year earlier. Revenue jumped 40% to $2.1 billion from $1.5 billion. Sempra Chairman Steve Baum attributed the growth, which stands in marked contrast to the financial woes of California 's other electric-utility-owning energy companies, to Sempra's unregulated operations. Calpine's profit increased despite paying substantially more for natural gas to fuel its plants. It spent an average of $4.80 per million British Thermal Units for natural gas, up from $3.31 a year before. At the same time, Calpine's revenue per megawatt hour of electricity sold also rose, to $71.03 in the latest period from $64.80 a year earlier. At Sempra, Mr. Baum said profit from Sempra's biggest utility unit, San Diego Gas & Electric, fell 7.5% to $37 million from $40 million. Results were flat at its gas-distribution company, Southern California Gas Co. Sempra Energy Trading was the big profit center, generating half its total profit, or $69 million, compared with $40 million a year earlier. Mr. Baum said Sempra's stock, which trades at a low price/earnings multiple of 10, still is being ""affected negatively by the California situation."" He also said the company made less money in spot-power markets than in prior quarters but nevertheless intends to invest $2 billion in new power plants. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Calpine shares rose $1.08 to $36.89, while Sempra climbed 17 cents to $25.49.",1,"Company Business, Strategy, etc."

involved in economic regulation (not just the usual environment, safety, 
labor and other types of regulation which all businesses are subject to).

California Changes Stance on Refunds; Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks
Peter Behr

07/06/2001
The Washington Post
FINAL
Page E01
Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved


California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to
recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity , saying
they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate
$43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this
year.


Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is
seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term
contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for
Davis.


""We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could
get us $8.9 billion,"" Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report
yesterday. ""You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money.
However you want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion.""


The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a
California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources
close to the negotiations.


Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on
the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot
reach a compromise.


""What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood,"" Wagner told
reporters. ""In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I
may offer a preliminary assessment."" The settlement conference is set to
conclude on Monday.


Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both
sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing
controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's
largest utility, drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and
put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's
lights on.


Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn,
chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid
manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in
refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said.


Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers
for all sides, is closed to the public and media.


Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda,
and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a ""joke"" that the
parties might as well wear ""clown suits,"" according to a Dow Jones report
confirmed by sources close to the talks.


But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by
Reliant Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern
Co., for failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The
suppliers have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able
to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds,
sources said.


Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's
commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but
now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's
electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher
refund figure, some energy analysts believe.


Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of
an overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will
have to pay for energy under those deals.


California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed
deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at
volatile ""spot market"" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer,
so did the state's electricity bills.


In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began
negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in
deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a
megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the
next 10 years.


That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was
paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and
considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade,
energy analysts say.


A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political
pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's
controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that
reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should
count as a ""refund"" because the deals were reached ""under commercial
duress,"" according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations.


Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify.
""There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be,"" said
Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research
Associates.


The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a ""just and reasonable""
standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit,
the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure.


""It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate,""
said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight
committee for the California grid.


Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room
""billions of dollars apart,"" as the talks approached their final weekend,
sources said.

Subject: FERC's Prospective Mitigation and Monitoring Plan for CA Wholesale 
Electric Markets

The following report is comprised of what was discussed at the Commission 
meeting held tonight at approximately 7 PM EST and additional intelligence 
gathered from FERC staffers after the meeting by Joe Hartsoe:

Physical Withholding -- To prevent physical withholding, the plan will 
require sellers with PGA's to offer all their available power in real time.  
All California generators, even those not subject to FERC price regulation, 
will be required to sell into the ISO's real time market as a condition of 
their use of the ISO's interstate transmission lines. Hydroelectric 
facilities will be exempted. (24-7 for 1yr) 

Price Mitigation -  The plan will establish a single market clearing price 
auction for the real time market.  During Stage 1, 2 and 3 emergencies in the 
ISO's real time market, each generator (other than hydro) with a 
participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power 
and bid its marginal cost based on the generator's heat curve, emission 
rates, gas costs and emission costs, plus $2 for O&M.  The gas cost will be 
the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California; 
emissions are to be based on Cammon Fitzgerald(?).  The gas cost and 
emissions will be published the day after, for use on the following day.  A 
single market clearing price is determined in real time for all generators.  
Highest bid sets the clearing price.  Each gas fired generator must file with 
FERC and the ISO, on a confidential basis, heat and emission rates for each 
generating unit.  The ISO will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost 
for each generator, including maintenance and operating costs.  In the event 
a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price, the generator must, 
within 7 days of the end of each month, file a report with FERC and the ISO 
justifying its price.  FERC has 60 days to review/act.  No opportunity costs 
in real time.  Marketers are in the same boat, as they must be prepared to 
justify bid at purchased cost based on specific purchases or portfolio with 
no opportunity cost.  However, credit sleeves are permissible.

Demand Response - Beginning June 1, only public utility load serving entities 
must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be 
curtailed under those bids.  FERC is attempting to break the demand curve.  
(24-7)  

Outages -- PGA generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced 
outages in accordance with the Commission Staff proposal adopted by FERC. 

Term - Order expires one year from date of issuance.

RTO Filing - California ISO and two Utilities must make RTO filing by June 1 
or Order lapses with no further effect.

ISO Reporting - On September 14, 2001, ISO must file a status report on how 
things are working and how much generation has been built.  Comments are due 
in 15 days.  Quarterly reports thereafter.

Revocation of Market Based Rate Authority and Refunds - The market based rate 
authority of all public utilities is conditioned on 1) no physical withhold 
of capacity, and 2) no inappropriate bidding behavior.  Inappropriate bidding 
behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the 
generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit 
behavior.  An increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be 
inappropriate.  In addition, ""hockey stick"" bids are expressly prohibited 
(i.e.  bidding 95% at marginal cost and 5% at a much higher level).

Limited 206 filing - Applies to sales in the WSCC, outside California.  
Refund conditions apply in real time spot markets when contingency within a 
control area falls below 7%.  Control areas are not required to publish when 
this condition occurs.  Apparently anything over marginal cost must be 
justified.  All marketers and non-hydroelectric generators must offer to sell 
contractually and physically available capacity/energy to a location within 
WSCC.  FERC is attempting to mirror the rules applied in California.  
Comments are due in 10 days on the 206 investigations.  The refund effective 
date is 60 days from publication of the Order.

Nox Limits in California --  Must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is 
prohibited from running by law.  However, it appears that incurring fines 
does not overcome the must sell requirement- just include the fines as part 
of the price bid.  Also if Nox is limited, may seek to show that generation 
would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price.  

Surcharge to pay past amount due -- Comments are due in 30 days on 1) whether 
FERC should require the ISO to surcharge parties for payment into an escrow 
account to pay past costs and 2) the effect this surcharge would have on the 
PG&E bankruptcy filing.  

No mention was made at the meeting as to issue of exports of power from 
California.  The Order is not finally drafted as of yet, and the status of 
the foregoing items could change upon issuance of the Final Order.  We will 
keep you posted.

1099 information is only produced if an account earns more than $10 in 
dividend/interest income.  Your savings for the year 2000 earned $3.96 and 
you have the free checking account which is non-interest bearing so there 
were no dividends earned on that account.  If you need additional

Lizzette. Would you mind getting with Diane on the isue of online harassment prevention training?  We have been looking into that form of delivering training. Diane has info from Littler on its proposed training. I think that the costs may be high, but I would like your evaluation of The product. Would you mind taking the lead on this?  Obviously, this is not an issue with huge time sensitivity. Thanks. Michelle

Hi Julie,

Rice asked me to teach another course on energy derivatives and I plan to use the 
book as the main source. You can inform them that they should keep the books in stock
and probably order a few more copies.

I am in London right now and will stay here for a few more days. Swamped
with work as usual. I was on the road for the last 2 weeks.

The tropical storm unleashed the fury on my neighborhood (20 inches in  one night)
but we survived without major problems. The only problem I had was an overflowing 
swimming pool (it took 45 minutes to go  from a comfortable slack to a full condition).

Vince

Vince,
 
Hope you are well.  
 
We've been in contact with Rice University's bookshop and they informed us  that they have a few books left over from the course.  We told them  originally that if they didn't sell them all we would take them back.  We  would rather have them sent over to you as complimentary copies if that's  OK with you?
 
What's new?  Busy summer so far?  Hope that the storm didn't  cause you any problems.

Steve Kean wanted me to forward you the information on the California Issues 
Database that was developed for the current California power problem. 
Attached are the instructions on how to use the site. You will have access to 
the secured part of the site by the end of the day, Monday, August 26th.

Thanks,

Subject: California Power Issues Database

We have developed an intranet site/database for information tracking purposes 
for the California Power Issue. The intranet site will be placed on the 
home.enron.com webpage by Tuesday morning for all Enron employees to access. 
However, today, this comprehensive database is available to you for your 
California Power Issue needs. 

The database has been populated with the latest information that I have 
received concerning this topic and has been broken down in three categories:
California Power Issues, National Power Issues and Secured Documents. It has 
then been broken down further into subcategories.

The secured documents sections will only be accessible to those that are 
receiving this e-mail. Please let me know if you believe others should have 
access to this information. The secured document section contains all the 
information that I have received that Luntz Consulting has helped us develop, 
i.e. principals, statements, speeches and facts, as well as, talking points 
and other statements developed internally. These documents can be easily 
switched to open access to all Enron employees if you believe that these 
documents should not be restricted.

To access the intranet site you must be logged on to the network and then go 
to this link:  http://nahou-lndev02d.corp.enron.com/GovtAffa.nsf  (It is best 
if you copy this link and paste it in your internet Explorer or Netscape 
browser.)

Once you are at this site you will  be able to access all articles and 
information that I have collected/received concerning the California Power 
Issue. You can navigate the site by using the links on the left hand side of 
the screen. While navigating this site, keep in mind that the actual 
interface will be changed before we go live on Tuesday morning. 

To access the secured documents, click on secured documents and type in your 
user name, which is the same as if you are logging onto the network, and then 
type in your password, which is the same as if you are logging onto the 
network. However, if you have difficulties entering this site, you will need 
to change your Lotus internet password. Which is very simple to do and which 
you will need to do regardless if you decide to use this site or not, it is 
all part of the current computer migration. To change your internet password, 
go to this link  and then hit the edit person key. Go to the last field that 
says internet password and type in whatever password you would like, 
preferably your current network login password. (In the internet password 
section you will see a bunch of numbers and letters, delete those and enter 
your new network password.) 

There are still some bugs that will be worked out by Tuesday, but I thought 
since this is such a fast moving issue it was best to get this tool out so it 
could be used when needed. If you have any questions, please call me at 
713-853-4382.

Thanks,

Gavin
