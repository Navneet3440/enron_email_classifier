David, i agree in principle with this process.  I assume that you and your 
team will implement.  Like we spoke about, I do not see a need to widely 
distribute this through the commercial organization.  I would just implement.

can ask Kay or Kim to send out under ENA OTC header to distribution list

Re: Confidential - New Procedures to be introduced by ENA OTC for Exec 
Employment Agreements and Hiring of Commercial Staff Below VP into ENA

Effective immediately we have asked the ENA HR department to implement the 
following changes to procedures to assist us in managing these two very 
important processes, more consistently and effectively:

Hiring of all Commercial Managers or Directors (VP process will remain as is)
Business Unit leads and MD's will remain responsible for developing and 
pursuing speculative talent for their groups and, within their budgets, will 
also remain responsible for managing their overall headcount.
The HR department will continue to support this effort by focusing on 
providing each of you with a flow of speculative resumes which you should 
spend time each week reviewing and providing feedback on so that this 
pipeline can be refined and better targeted.
The interviewing process for all Commercial Managers and Directors should be 
very rigorous and should include at least 2 interviews by VP's in addition to 
the sponsoring Business Unit lead plus a minimum of 3 senior individuals 
within the sponsoring group (ie total of 6 in most cases).
Effective immediately, once the sponsoring group lead has completed their 
interviewing process and would like to extend an offer of employment, the 
candidate must be interviewed by the ENA OTC, before an offer of employment 
will be released by the HR department. No candidates should be referred to 
the ENA OTC for interview before the sponsoring group has concluded and 
resolved  ALL issues surrounding whether they themselves wish to hire the 
candidate.
Since any offer of employment at Commercial Manager or Director will now be 
contingent upon approval by the ENA OTC, candidates expectations should be 
managed to ensure they appreciate this final interview will be necessary.
John Lavorato has agreed to conduct the majority of these interviews, which 
will be co-ordinated via your HR representative. Where the candidate is out 
of town, these will be conducted via telephone.

Executive Employment Agreement Process for Commercial Staff
Effective immediately, the process for identifying and negotiating Executive 
Employment Agreements for Commercial staff at ENA will be modified as follows:
For all Commercial staff, the sponsoring Business Unit lead or Managing 
Director, should agree in principle the need for a contract with John 
Lavorato of the ENA OTC. This request should be by either email or voicemail 
and should include the following information: (1) Name, (2) Level (3) 
Business focus and/or project (4) Their latest 2 PRC results (5) The reason 
or justification for offering them a contract.
In any other instance (ie non-commercial employees), the sponsoring BU lead 
or MD should contact David Oxley, Wholesale Group VP for HR for direction.
Once the ENA OTC has approved in principle the negotiation of a contract, 
your HR representative listed below will assist you in preparing draft 
financial terms on the familiar contract request form.
Before a draft contract will be prepared by the ENA legal team, the financial 
terms (the request form in other words) must be approved by John Lavorato in 
the ENA OTC. In the event of a tight deadline, John may approve the two steps 
described here at 1 and 4 simultaneously by email or voicemail.
Any subsequent changes in terms must also be approved by the ENA OTC before a 
fresh draft will be produced.

The following HR Representatives will assist you with these new procedures:

Vince,

A couple of brief issues:

1) I have been asked to deliver a lecture(s) to a Rice environmental engineering class in the fall.  Most of the preparatory work for the class is already complete, so I don't foresee any large time commitment for this endeavor.  If there is a problem, let me know.

2) A manuscript based on my dissertation work was recently accepted for publication by ASCE Journal of Environmental Engineering.  I would like to use my Enron address and contact information on the work, but am unsure of company policies.  I can certainly default to the Rice information if there is a problem.

Great summary.  I think the two main issues you raise are the right ones, b=

Looks fine to me.  I have not cross checked the lists, but I assume you have 
included everyone who was designated to serve on the PRCs per the original 
memo (in addition to the new bus unit additions)

Subject: DRAFT - AA PRC MEMO

Attached is a draft memo (including attachments) outlining the modifications 
we discussed last week.  We can communicate changes by email, or I'll be 
happy to arrange a short conference call.  If possible, I would like to 
distribute this by Wednesday or Thursday of this week.  After the four of us 
reach consensus, I suggest we preview Cindy (and maybe the HR heads) prior to 
distributing.  

You will note that based on conversations I had with Skilling last week 
(where he emphasized his desire that we have one program, rather than a 
fractured program by business unit), I have added a review of the business 
unit distributions to the final meeting where we discuss the top perfomers.  
I've also added Janet Dietrich (tent.) and another EES person (tbd) to the AA 
Committee, since they have a large group of AAs and no representation on the 
committee.  

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments, and thanks for your 
help.  Ted and Terry did all the hard work.

Regards,
Billy

We do not have the Europe groups included.  Should probably include, or note

Announcing the Formation of One Corporate Equity Investing Unit

To better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to our 
core businesses, Enron has formed one corporate equity investment unit.  This 
new unit, Enron Principal Investments, will combine the existing investment 
units of ENA, EBS and Enron Investment Partners.  Additionally, the Enron 
Special Asset Group will also become part of Enron Principal Investments.  
The strategy of Enron Principal Investments will be to work with all the 
business units of Enron to identify, execute, and manage equity investments, 
which leverage Enron's unique and proprietary knowledge.   These investments 
may be in the form of venture capital, LBO's, traditional private equity and 
distressed debt positions.   

Kevin Garland will serve as Managing Director, overseeing all activities of 
Enron Principal Investments.  Gene Humphrey, Michael Miller, Dick Lydecker, 
and their groups, will join Kevin and his group to form Enron Principal 
Investments.  This new business unit will report to an investment committee, 
consisting of Greg Whalley, Ken Rice and Dave Delainey. 

 Please join me in congratulating and supporting Kevin, Gene, Michael, Dick 
and the other members of this group in this effort.

Jeff Skilling

Bill, we hit a home run this morning with HCAD.  They have agreed to take my 
reduced valuation on the Enron fleet.  A reduction of  $16,079,000 in taxable 
value.  This results in savings of $482,375.  That's not all, our allocation 
based on records for operations outside of the state of Texas resulted in 
additional savings of $1,559,638. Total savings to our 2000 budget will be 
$2,042,013.

Agreed.  Trying to be too cute with our strategy is difficult. 

Look, about 4 years ago we pulled out of the market.  I think that we need to 
simply accept that these customers are going back sooner or later.  NPC won't 
even pick this up.

Subject: Re: CONFIDENTIAL - Residential in CA  

I like the idea, particularly if we can time any decision to turn the 
customers back so it falls after the failure to get some action out of Sacto 
(instead of after our earnings release).   

The only problem I see is that we would need a decision from the top that 
we're not going to turn the customers back if we get direct access (so we can 
end the debate).  I don't think it helps us if we get lucky, get direct 
access back, then make a decision to return customers to the utility.

Subject: Re: CONFIDENTIAL - Residential in CA  

Before any decision is made, I think we really need to weigh in with EES on 
the ramifications (both PR and legislative) of turning back 16,000 
residential customers.  I strongly believe that the public hit we will take 
will be far greater than our actual out-of-pocket losses.  We will be 
crucified by the public, media, consumer groups, legislators, governor, 
attorney general, etc.,  and this action will reaffirm our reputation of 
packing up and leaving when it's not in our interest.  The impact of this 
action would be exacerbated since it is on the heels of UC/CSU.  

I would also argue that this hurts our national dereg efforts.  If we're 
advocating that competition and choice benefits consumers and then we turn 
around and pull out of a market and abandon customers when we're not 
""profiting,"" we'll kill any chances we have of ever serving retail customers 
in California -- or in any other state.  We look foolish advocating for 
direct access when we're not willing to serve our existing -- let alone 
future customers 

What about a preemptive strike that engages these 16,000 customers to weigh 
in on direct access -- i.e. a letter that says ""Enron may be forced to cancel 
its contract -- call/write/send the enclosed postcard to your legislator and 
tell them you want to keep your right to choose your energy service provider.""

Our credibility is on the line.  Before we take this action, we need to be 
cognizant of all the long-range strategic implications, and we need to 
seriously weigh the negative impact this will have on our corporate 
reputation, on our legislative abilities and on our commercial success going 
forward.

Subject: CONFIDENTIAL - Residential in CA


	

In the meeting today, no decision was made about what to do with Enron's 
16,000 residential customers.   Each of the contracts gives a basic 30 day 
out right to Enron.

That being said, I think that we have a short window to push for DA before 
any public action impacts us in Sacramento.  

I realize that the ultimate action (which I think is inevitable) makes it 
harder for our advocacy on DA, but real $ are flowing out of the company.

EES will give us notice when a decision is reached.

Thanks,

Jim

The exciting cocktail of credit derivatives and Enron Online raises 
significant novel legal risks for Enron.  As most of you will by now know, 
probably the most significant risk would arise in a situation where Enron has 
confidential information about a reference entity and wrongfully uses that 
information in pricing the credit derivative on that entity.  This could well 
result in legal proceeding against Enron.  In practice, an allegation of 
misuse of confidential information can be very difficult indeed to defend 
without adequate procedures in place to safeguard that information.  In 
fact,  Enron's credit trading will, as you know, rely strictly on publicly 
available financial information and will not involve the use of confidential 
information, unless the reference entity has specifically consented.  
Nevertheless, to avoid the appearance of impropriety, we are taking 
additional steps to consider confidentiality agreements we have in place with 
potential reference entities before deciding whether or not we will quote 
prices on such entities.

Against this background is the ever-present risk of ""insider dealing"".  This 
crime - which in the UK carries a maximum prison sentence of 7 years and an 
unlimited fine - is committed where a person (or member of their family etc) 
deals in the securities (shares, bonds or derivatives on them) of a listed 
company on the basis of unpublished (confidential) price-sensitive 
information.  We do not expect at this time to deal in publicly traded bonds 
as part of EnronCredit.com, but insider dealing is relevant to the conduct of 
Enron staff and could affect other parts of our business.  In addition, SFA 
rules in the UK require the safeguarding of confidential information, the 
misuse of which is a serious disciplinary matter.

In order to ensure the success of this new business and that confidential 
information is not misused either by Enron or its staff, we are now 
introducing important new policies and procedures in Europe and in the US.  
These procedures have been drawn up specifically for your credit trading 
group by lawyers in London, Houston and New York and are attached.  Please 
familiarise yourself, and any future member of the group,  with these 
procedures. Once you have read and understood the attached procedures each 
one of you is required to confirm this to me in writing (or by note mail).

Please note that similar procedures have been distributed to the key business 
heads in Europe who may have confidential information about reference 
entities (similar procedures are being disrtibuted to US business heads).  
This requires them to safeguard confidential information and to abide by the 
Restriced List procedure described below.  Nevertheless, you should treat 
your group as being within a Chinese Wall and see it as your personal 
responsibility not to solicit or accept from anyone in Enron information 
about reference entities which may be confidential. 

Thank you for your co-operation in implementing these important new 
procedures.  I look forward to receiving your confirmation mentioned above 
(which is also described in the procedures). 

Best regards

Paul

Steve I need your help. Twice in the last three months I have run into the 
Chairman of AGA who has taken my head off for Enron not renewing its AGA 
dues. I understand that the dues had been paid by  Stan Horton who had 
decided that the pipeline group with INGAA representing it had no need for 
and received no benefit from the membership. I guess a few years back, when 
AGA ""kicked"" the pipelines out, they renegotiated the dues into some type of 
sub membership for around 85K.

AGA approached the gas marketing team and talked to Mike Roberts about 
renewing the membership and maintaining relations with his customers and 
later to Jeff Shankman who passed them off to some other person and never got 
back to them as promised.  This is a heads up to tell you that Bob Catell of 
Brooklyn Union fame- one of Enron's oldest customers and friends will be 
calling Lay.

It seems to me that pro rating the dues among ENA and EGM and maybe GPG might 
be a solution. Anyhow, I promised to pass on the complaint. Thanks.

I realize you have pushed these guys already, but the attached letter would 
be better if not sent at all.  It doesn't address the real underlying problem 
-- that a ""reliability bill"" on a stand alone basis doesn't fix the problem.  
Instead, the letter implies that the reason for opposition is merely a 
political consideration -- ie that it may reduce Congress' appetite for 
action next year.  If possible, it would be better not to have the letter go 
out at all.

In our litigation meeting last Tuesday, we learned that netting of spot purchases and sales is of paramount importance in limiting our exposure to refunds, under the FERC's July 26 Order, in both the California and Pacific Northwest proceedings.  However, in the California proceeding we are also afforded the opportunity in the Order to offset our receivables against any refund that would otherwise have to be paid by us.  Also, to the extent that our receivables exceed the refund amount, the Order provides for payment of interest to us in accordance with CFR Section 35.19a.  

At present, I am aware of the existence of three receivables.

I communicated the possibility of offsetting this receivable against any potential refund at this mornings Western Wholesale conference call, and subsequent research conducted by Alan Comnes indicates that the CAISO owes us $30MM, as per the CAISO's own numbers.

The CAISO also owes us approximately $40MM due to nonpayment for one to two months of business.  These two figures alone, totalling approximately $70MM, exceed the estimate of our potential exposure in the California proceeding.

Finally, the negative CTC issue is another receivable due us by IOU's that, under the plain language of the Order, could potentially be used to offset any refund amount.  I am not aware of the magnitude of this receivable but do understand that there are some sensitivities regarding this issue, including concerns about revealing the amount of the credit due us.

California Adopts Variable Pricing, Raising Ire of Generators, Traders
By Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

10/30/2000
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -- In the latest attempt to fix California's troubled deregulated 
energy market, officials adopted a unique variable-pricing plan that already 
is being criticized by power generators and traders as unworkable and praised 
by utilities and consumers as much needed protection against gouging. 
Under the plan, adopted late last week by the governing board of the 
California Independent System Operator, or ISO, a quasipublic agency 
responsible for maintaining electricity reliability in the state, the cap on 
wholesale power will be reset hourly from about $65 per megawatt hour at 
low-demand times to no more than $250 an hour at periods of high demand. It 
was the third time this year that officials effectively lowered the price cap 
on wholesale electricity in a bid to contain -- so far unsuccessfully -- 
soaring total power costs.
The move underscores the chaotic atmosphere prevailing in California's power 
market after a two-year-old experiment in deregulation has come undone. In 
other deregulated markets such as New York and New England, prices are capped 
at $1000 per megawatt hour, which are intended to be low enough to prevent 
market abuse but high enough to give generators incentive to build new 
plants. California's system was supposed to work the same way. But because 
utilities in California divested themselves of the bulk of their plants but 
weren't allowed to lock in fixed-price supply contracts, unlike in the other 
markets, merchant generators have had much greater sway over prices here on 
the spot market, where most power trades. 
During the first nine months of the year, the average price of wholesale 
electricity was $90 per megawatt hour in California, triple the price of a 
year earlier. Even on cool days in October, the price generally has remained 
above $100 per megawatt hour. California utilities have lost money on those 
power purchases because their customers' rates are frozen at $54 to $65 per 
megawatt hour, far lower than the average price utilities have had to pay for 
that power. The deficits exceeded $5 billion in the June-to-September period. 
California utilities buy the power used by their customers from the 
state-sanctioned auctions administered by the ISO and a sister organization, 
the California Power Exchange. In New York and New England, by comparison, 
less than 20% of power is purchased from the spot markets because utilities 
there were able to sign the fixed-price contracts, which California utilities 
weren't allowed to do. The price-cap decision passed last week by a vote of 
13 to 10, primarily with support from utilities and board members 
representing consumer interests. It was pushed aggressively by Pacific Gas & 
Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, the state's two big 
investor-owned utilities that have gotten caught in the price-spike vise this 
year. 
Some ISO members say they had no choice but to support the measure to ratchet 
down price caps. ""We're going after the windfall profits,"" said S. David 
Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, 
who voted for the measure. ""What we've got now is a market accustomed to 
ripping off the consumer. This can't be allowed to go on."" 
But other experts said the hasty measure may make California's problems even 
worse. ""The short-term regulatory fix is always to fix prices,"" said Pam 
Prairie, director of the Institute of Public Utilities at Michigan State 
University in East Lansing. ""But there's a real danger you'll set prices too 
low and make your supply problems even worse."" 
Other economists agreed. ""At best, this is poorly administered cost-based 
regulation,"" said Frank Wolak, an economics professor at Stanford University 
who sits on an independent market-monitoring committee at the ISO. ""At worst, 
it creates all sorts of perverse market incentives."" 
For example, it may increase the problem of ""megawatt laundering"" on hot days 
in which in-state generators sell power to out-of-state customers who then 
sell it back into the state, effectively bypassing the cap. Likewise, it 
could encourage generators to build new plants outside of California, rather 
than where they are needed near its major cities, also to avoid the cap. In 
the end, it could increase stresses to the state's already overburdened 
transmission system. 
In fact, the decision already has brought to a halt the state's forward 
electricity market, which allows wholesale customers to sign contracts for 
power they will use in the future. The market had been trading as much as 
1,000 contracts a week. On Friday, there was practically no activity. 
""This decision shows the height of lunacy,"" said Rick Shapiro, a managing 
director at Enron Corp., the giant Houston-based energy trader. Mr. Shapiro 
said Enron and other generators will file appeals at the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission asking that the new pricing formula be rescinded. 
It is possible the FERC may throw out the pricing formula anyway. It is 
expected to issue a major order on Nov. 1 directing changes in California's 
market structure. That order will include its determination of the 
effectiveness of price caps. It also is expected to judge the merits of the 
governance structure at the ISO, which has lately been marked by infighting. 
Recently, consumer groups have charged that the ISO board has put the 
business interests of its members ahead of members' fiduciary duty to 
California residents. 
The most recent price-cap measure was approved over the objections of 
executives at the ISO whose job it will be to implement the formula. ISO 
Chief Executive Terry Winter said the measure is flawed because it doesn't 
take into account the amount of power available to the California market. Mr. 
Winter fears the caps will place the state at a disadvantage relative to 
neighboring states with no price caps. About 11 states are electrically 
interconnected in the West, meaning power can be moved between them and chase 
the highest prices. 
""We keep getting accused of making our market too complicated,"" Mr. Winter 
said. ""Then along comes this proposal"" with caps that would adjust repeatedly 
throughout the day, depending on demand.

Enron Offers Cash To Help Azurix Take Itself Private
By Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

Enron Corp. offered to lend Azurix Corp., an Enron spinoff, $275 million so 
that it could take itself private. 
Enron, which has been frustrated with the global water company's performance, 
suggested Friday that public shareholders receive a cash offer of $7 a share 
for their Azurix stock. While nearly double the stock's value prior to the 
offer, the suggested price nevertheless was far below the $19 at which Azurix 
made its debut in 1999.
An Azurix spokeswoman said the board, on which Enron has seats, had not yet 
decided how to treat the Enron offer. An Enron spokesman said that taking the 
company private would ""give us more opportunity to directly affect our 
investment."" In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, 
Azurix soared $3 to $6.56 in heavy trading. 
Azurix had hoped to create a splash by doing to the water business what Enron 
had done to the energy business -- increase competition and provide trading 
skills capable of creating new financial products out of old commodities. But 
Azurix stumbled, nearly from the outset. Deregulation of the water business 
and government privatizations of water systems, on which it was counting, 
were slow to come, crimping growth opportunities and profit. And Enron, 
accustomed to higher, faster returns, grew impatient with the 
capital-intensive water business. 
The company's first chief executive, Rebecca Mark, a onetime head of Enron's 
international division, resigned in the summer with the agreement of Enron 
executives, who said it was time for new leadership. The incoming chief 
executive, John Garrison, said he would look for buyers for some of the 
company's businesses; he was unavailable to comment Friday. Ms. Mark was 
believed to be considering making an offer for some of those businesses, 
herself. She declined a request for an interview. 
In its letter to Azurix officers, Enron said the water company received four 
offers from prospective suitors after Ms. Mark's departure, the best of which 
came from an unidentified bidder who offered $7 a share and went through a 
lengthy due-diligence process before backing down, apparently spooked by 
Azurix's cash flow, capital structure, tax considerations and some securities 
litigation. 
In its proposal letter, made public Friday, Enron said it concluded ""that 
there is no other buyer willing to pay the $7"" and so proceeded with its own 
offer. But Enron said it won't try to limit Azurix's ability to negotiate a 
better deal with others, should they come forward. Finally, Enron noted that 
Azurix had considered various partial or full-liquidation alternatives but 
said they didn't seem likely to produce more than $7 a share.

Wessex switch likely

Wessex Water's American parent company is likely to be taken private after a 
disastrous 14-month spell as a quoted company. 
Wessex, which provides water services to the South of England, was bought by 
Azurix in 1998 for Pounds 1.6 billion. Azurix wanted to use Wessex's 
expertise in privatised water supply to build a global business. However, 
since listing at $19 a share in June last year, Azurix stock has gone into 
freefall, closing at less than $4 earlier this week. Azurix slumped because 
it drastically misjudged the number of privatisation opportunities.
It emerged last night that Enron, the Texan energy and trading company that 
is Azurix's biggest shareholder, has taken the unusual step of offering to 
lend Azurix $275 million (Pounds 190 million) to buy its publicly held 
shares, thereby taking it private. 
The Enron proposal would value Azurix at about $800 million or $7 per share - 
63 per cent less than the IPO price. Enron would control Azurix and Wessex 
Water if it went private.

Enron water unit could go private under loan plan

Enron offered Friday to lend Azurix, its struggling water affiliate, about 
$275 million so Azurix can go private by purchasing 38.6 million shares that 
are publicly traded. 
The deal would have Azurix buying back its stock at $7 per share, about 
double what the shares were trading for Thursday. That's a big comedown for 
Azurix shares, which sold for $19 each when the Houston company went public 
in June 1999.
The maneuver technically can be called a ""take-under,"" said analyst Carol 
Coale of Prudential Securities in Houston. She also described it as Enron's 
least painful solution for what to do with the venture that never lived up 
its ambitious plans. 
""Nothing about Azurix has been positive for Enron, in my view,"" said Coale. 
""This is a solution to a problem."" 
Azurix spokeswoman Diane Bazelides said its board is studying Enron's 
proposal. She added that it was too early to comment on the offer because the 
proposal's structure had not been outlined. 
Enron imposed no deadline for a decision by Azurix, but reserved the right to 
withdraw the offer if Azurix's position with prospective customers and 
employees deteriorated. 
One of Enron's conditions is that Azurix not sell any major assets before the 
buyout. 
The deal would not change Enron's large stake in Azurix, said Palmer. It owns 
a third, while the other third is owned by the Atlantic Water Trust, in which 
Enron owns a 50 percent voting interest. 
The proposal's advantages include giving public shareholders a premium to the 
market price, said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. 
The common stock of Azurix zoomed Friday on the news, gaining $3 to close at 
$6.56 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Becoming a private company would give Azurix management greater flexibility 
in restructuring. Coale said it would reduce Azurix's general and 
administrative costs, helping it to bid against lower- cost foreign 
competition, particularly two big French companies. Azurix's high cost 
structure has been its primary problem, she said. 
Azurix has been looking at cost and strategies ever since it got a new 
president and chief executive on Aug. 25, said Bazelides. That was the date 
that Rebecca Mark resigned as Azurix's high-profile chairman and chief 
executive. 
Enron and Azurix have been looking at ""strategic alternatives"" for nine 
months, J. Mark Meets, Enron's executive vice president for corporate 
development, said in a letter filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
One alternative was selling the company, he said. 
That didn't work out because the offers from three companies didn't exceed $4 
per share. 
The fourth potential buyer said it would consider offering $7 per share, said 
Meets. But that suitor backed out, citing reasons like cash flow, complexity 
of the capital structure, tax considerations and pending securities 
litigation.

Quietly, Bush's team talks about transition; Plenty of folks in Austin would 
love to follow Bush to D.C.
Ken Herman American-Statesman Capitol Bureau Chief

Not long ago, at a glossy wooden table in a Texas Capitol office, two of Gov. 
George W. Bush's high-level appointees discussed one of the key issues in 
state government these days. It involved the relative merits of White House 
posts that could be available to the two appointees if Bush becomes 
president. 
Asked this week whether it's a common topic around the Capitol, one of the 
appointees gestured to the anteroom of his office and made a motion 
indicating that even the midlevel folks have Washington on their minds.
Near the banks of the Colorado, Potomac Fever is a near-epidemic. 
And though it is political faux pas to be too open about doing White House 
transition planning before Election Day, be assured it is going on at Bush 
headquarters, where top officials are cognizant of the fine line between 
looking too confident now and looking too unprepared later. 
The candidate himself -- as well as his top aides -- steers clear of 
transition talk. When asked who might wind up in his Cabinet, Bush looks 
backward instead of forward, saying that his selection of Dick Cheney as his 
running mate should offer a glimpse of the kind of people who would wind up 
in his administration. 
The transition work, such that it is, is under the aegis of longtime Bush 
friend and aide Clay Johnson, who began as head of the gubernatorial 
appointments office and now serves as chief of staff. Johnson said nobody has 
been interviewed for any Washington post, but he has compiled a file of folks 
who are interested in serving in a Bush administration. 
Johnson also has been reading up on previous transitions -- ones that went 
well and ones that didn't. His preliminary conclusion is that the outgoing 
administrations are generally helpful and supportive, even if they were 
ousted by the incoming administration. It's the incoming administrations that 
can make the mistakes, he said. 
There is no shortage of think tanks that have think-tanked the topic. Back in 
August, the Heritage Foundation, based in Washington, issued a transition 
handbook titled ""The Keys to a Successful Presidency."" 
""Though we really don't expect either campaign to talk about it (and would 
discourage them from doing so), the message here is it's time to start 
planning for a possible presidential transition, quietly, well behind the 
scenes, but with the understanding that the preparation done during the next 
70 or so days, and the work done in the 70 or so days that follow (between 
the election and the inauguration) will very well determine the initial 
success or failure of the next administration,"" Herbert Berkowitz, a 
foundation vice president, said in releasing the study. 
All indications are that the Bush team has been following the advice, with 
Johnson at the helm. 
Johnson cautions against expectations that a Bush administration would be 
overloaded with Texans. 
""It's the United States of America, not the United States of Texas,"" he said. 
Despite that caveat, there is no shortage of Texans who are considered 
shoo-ins to fill some of the thousands of slots Bush could offer if he wins. 
Johnson confirms that he is very interested in a Washington job. Early 
speculation among Bush aides makes Johnson a potential leading contender for 
head of personnel at the White House. 
Karen Hughes, Bush's communications director since his 1994 gubernatorial 
campaign, is expected to become Bush's press secretary if he wins the White 
House. Karl Rove, Bush's longtime political guru, also will be on board, 
though he could wind up with an out-of- the-White-House post, perhaps at the 
Republican National Committee. 
Not as certain is the potential future for Joe Allbaugh, who is part of the 
""iron triangle"" of top advisers -- along with Rove and Hughes -- who have 
been on board with Bush since the 1994 campaign. Allbaugh serves as manager 
of the presidential campaign and previously served as chief of staff in the 
governor's office. 
Capitol speculation indicates Allbaugh could decide to skip a White House 
post, possibly in favor of a lobbying job, if he is not tapped as chief of 
staff. That post could go to Don Evans, a longtime Bush friend who headed the 
megasuccessful fund-raising effort for the presidential campaign. 
However, not everyone has Potomac Fever. For example, Terral Smith, Bush's 
legislative director, said he will stay in Austin to lobby. 
In addition to the speculation about appointees, the approaching election has 
sparked talk about when Bush might leave office if he wins. Under the U.S. 
Constitution, he could remain governor until he has to become president on 
Jan. 20. 
Much more likely, however, is that Bush would leave office sooner than that, 
perhaps as soon as two or three weeks after the Nov. 7 election, if he wins. 
That could cause a housing problem for Bush, whose main residence is the 
Governor's Mansion, which comes as a free perk of the job. The Bushes have a 
home under construction at their ranch in Crawford, near Waco. The ranch also 
has a smaller house in which the Bushes now spend weekends. 
Not out of the question is that Bush could work out an arrangement with Lt. 
Gov. Rick Perry, who would become governor if Bush resigns, to remain in the 
Governor's Mansion for several weeks after he leaves office. 
If the race among Texas senators to replace Perry as lieutenant governor 
complicates the timing of the resignation, Bush could stay in the governor's 
office a little longer, but no later than the first week of January. After 
all, he will want to give Perry time to bask in his gubernatorial 
inauguration before the Legislature convenes Jan. 9. 
No matter when Bush resigns, confidantes believe he might use his Crawford 
ranch for interviews with potential top-level appointees, including Cabinet 
members.

Dynegy: Calif Price Caps Will Compromise Elec Reliability

10/27/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A Dynegy executive said Friday that the California 
Independent System Operator's plan to impose hourly price caps on the 
wholesale power market will compromise reliability by forcing generators to 
sell electricity out of state.
""If the ISO says it will not buy above a certain price and generators cannot 
operate below that price, then we have no choice but to find other markets to 
participate in,"" said Dynegy senior vice president of marketing and trading 
asset management Lynn Lednicky. ""That may lead to the ISO not finding the 
power it needs at a price it wants to pay."" 
The ISO plans to construct hourly price caps each month based on forecast 
load, natural gas prices and generation unit efficiency. The caps will take 
effect Nov. 3 or soon therafter. 
Dynegy Inc. (DYN) sent a letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
asking it to address reliability consequences of the price caps before Nov. 
3. Dynegy specifically requested that FERC discuss the issue at its Nov. 1 
meeting, when it will release a report on California's electricity problems. 
Enron Corp. (ENE) and Southern Company (SO) share Dynegy's concerns about 
reliability and plan to petition FERC about the issue, said a trader 
listening in to a conference call between the three companies.

SEC Filing Shows 3rd Parties Contacted Enron About Azurix
By Christopher C. Williams

10/27/2000
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

New York -(Dow Jones)- Shares of Azurix Corp. (AZX) jumped 84% in heavy 
trading Friday after parent Enron Corp. (ENE) proposed to take the company 
private in a $7-a-share buyout.
Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that Enron made 
the proposal after not being satisfied with offers it had received from four 
third parties for its stake in Azurix. 
In a letter to two members of Azurix's board, Enron said three potential 
buyers ""were unlikely to be willing to pay more than the then-current market 
price of approximately $4 a share."" 
Enron said a fourth potential buyer indicated it would consider a $7-a-share 
offer, but it said that proposal was recently withdrawn. ""The reasons given 
by the bidder included pro forma cash flows, the complexity of the capital 
structure, tax considerations and the currently pending securities 
litigation,"" the letter said. 
Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Houston-based Enron, declined to say whether 
Enron was entertaining current third-party interests or was in any talks with 
other parties regarding its Azurix stake. 
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Azurix ended Friday up $3 to 
$6.56 on 2.8 million shares, compared with average daily volume of 239,000 
shares. Enron was up $1.38, or 1.8%, to $78.88 on 1.6 million shares, 
compared with its daily average turnover of 2.4 million. 
In the SEC filing, Enron, saying it's familiar with Azurix's various partial 
and full liquidation alternatives, said its buyout proposal is conditioned 
upon Azurix not selling any significant assets prior to the buyout. 
""Although we agree that such plans may result in greater value to Azurix's 
shareholders than the maintenance of the status quo, we believe that these 
options almost certainly will not result on a present value in a greater 
return to Azurix's shareholders than $7 a share,"" the letter said. 
Enron also said its buyout proposal doesn't include any breakup fees or other 
""deal protection devices."" This frees Azurix's board to pursue an acquisition 
that ""might provide greater value"" to shareholders. 
Daine Bazelides, a spokeswoman for Azurix, declined to say whether Azurix is 
now entertaining offers for the company. She did, however, confirm the 
information contained in Enron's filing. ""The historical information in the 
filing is factually correct,"" she told Dow Jones Newswires. 
She said she doesn't know when Azurix board will respond to Enron's proposal. 
In the filing, Enron didn't set a deadline, but warned that Azurix's position 
with customers and employees may deteriorate further. ""We must therefore 
reserve the right to withdraw our proposal at any time,"" Enron's letter said. 
In the letter, Enron pointed out that Azurix had retained two 
""internationally recognized investment bankers"" early this year to evaluate 
strategic alternatives, which included the potential sale of the company to 
unrelated third parties. 
Enron said it strongly believes there isn't another buyer willing to pay $7 a 
share for Enron's indirect interest in Azurix. ""We believe it is in Azurix's 
best interest, as well as the best interest of its shareholders and 
employees, if Azurix were no longer a publicly traded company,"" Enron said.

Enron offers to buy out Azurix
Financial Times
By Hillary Durgin in Houston
Published: October 27 2000 23:31GMT | Last Updated: October 27 2000 23:36GMT


Enron, the Houston-based energy and trading group, said on Friday it had 
offered up to $275m in funding to take Azurix private at a buy-out price of 
$7 per share. 
The specific structure of Enron's proposal has yet to be determined, Enron 
said. Azurix said its board would now consider the proposal. The timing of 
any decision was unclear. 
Enron owns directly and indirectly about 66 per cent of Azurix, the troubled 
Houston water company, whose main asset is UK-based Wessex Water. 
The buyout offer is the latest development in a history of problems at 
Azurix, which was spun off from Enron and taken public at an offering price 
of $19 per share. 
But a combination of poor market timing, competitive industry conditions and 
empty promises by the company on Wall Street took their toll on the company, 
whose shares have since plummeted and have been trading most recently around 
the $3-per-share range. In August, Rebecca Mark, Azurix chief executive 
officer, resigned both from Azurix and from the board at Enron. 
Enron's offer came after four unnamed parties approached Enron about buying 
its stake in Azurix. 
While three of the four were unwilling to pay more than the then market price 
of about $4 per share, a fourth party who was considering offering $7 per 
share (before accounting for any dilution for stock options) later declined 
to pursue the transaction, Enron said in Friday's letter to Azurix, outlining 
the buyout proposal. 
""We strongly believe that our proposal is fair to Azurix's public 
stockholders,"" the letter stated. ""Our proposed transaction would permit 
Azurix's stockholders to receive, on a timely basis, a cash payment for their 
shares that is significantly above the price at which those shares have 
traded in several months."" 
Analysts that follow Azurix and had valued the shares at between $6 and $8 
per shares said the offer was fair. Analysts that follow Enron said that 
Azurix's business strategy had proved to be a failure and was characteristic 
of the hard asset approach that Enron has gradually distanced itself from. 
Enron's shares closed at $78.88 up $1.38 on Friday. Azurix's shares rose $3 
to close at $6.56.

LOS ANGELES -- In the latest attempt to fix California's troubled deregulated energy market, officials adopted a unique variable-pricing plan that already is being criticized by power generators and traders as unworkable and praised by utilities and consumers as much needed protection against gouging. Under the plan, adopted late last week by the governing board of the California Independent System Operator, or ISO, a quasipublic agency responsible for maintaining electricity reliability in the state, the cap on wholesale power will be reset hourly from about $65 per megawatt hour at low-demand times to no more than $250 an hour at periods of high demand. It was the third time this year that officials effectively lowered the price cap on wholesale electricity in a bid to contain -- so far unsuccessfully -- soaring total power costs. The move underscores the chaotic atmosphere prevailing in California's power market after a two-year-old experiment in deregulation has come undone. In other deregulated markets such as New York and New England, prices are capped at $1000 per megawatt hour, which are intended to be low enough to prevent market abuse but high enough to give generators incentive to build new plants. California's system was supposed to work the same way. But because utilities in California divested themselves of the bulk of their plants but weren't allowed to lock in fixed-price supply contracts, unlike in the other markets, merchant generators have had much greater sway over prices here on the spot market, where most power trades. During the first nine months of the year, the average price of wholesale electricity was $90 per megawatt hour in California, triple the price of a year earlier. Even on cool days in October, the price generally has remained above $100 per megawatt hour. California utilities have lost money on those power purchases because their customers' rates are frozen at $54 to $65 per megawatt hour, far lower than the average price utilities have had to pay for that power. The deficits exceeded $5 billion in the June-to-September period. California utilities buy the power used by their customers from the state-sanctioned auctions administered by the ISO and a sister organization, the California Power Exchange. In New York and New England, by comparison, less than 20% of power is purchased from the spot markets because utilities there were able to sign the fixed-price contracts, which California utilities weren't allowed to do. The price-cap decision passed last week by a vote of 13 to 10, primarily with support from utilities and board members representing consumer interests. It was pushed aggressively by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, the state's two big investor-owned utilities that have gotten caught in the price-spike vise this year. Some ISO members say they had no choice but to support the measure to ratchet down price caps. ""We're going after the windfall profits,"" said S. David Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, who voted for the measure. ""What we've got now is a market accustomed to ripping off the consumer. This can't be allowed to go on."" But other experts said the hasty measure may make California's problems even worse. ""The short-term regulatory fix is always to fix prices,"" said Pam Prairie, director of the Institute of Public Utilities at Michigan State University in East Lansing. ""But there's a real danger you'll set prices too low and make your supply problems even worse."" Other economists agreed. ""At best, this is poorly administered cost-based regulation,"" said Frank Wolak, an economics professor at Stanford University who sits on an independent market-monitoring committee at the ISO. ""At worst, it creates all sorts of perverse market incentives."" For example, it may increase the problem of ""megawatt laundering"" on hot days in which in-state generators sell power to out-of-state customers who then sell it back into the state, effectively bypassing the cap. Likewise, it could encourage generators to build new plants outside of California, rather than where they are needed near its major cities, also to avoid the cap. In the end, it could increase stresses to the state's already overburdened transmission system. In fact, the decision already has brought to a halt the state's forward electricity market, which allows wholesale customers to sign contracts for power they will use in the future. The market had been trading as much as 1,000 contracts a week. On Friday, there was practically no activity. ""This decision shows the height of lunacy,"" said Rick Shapiro, a managing director at Enron Corp., the giant Houston-based energy trader. Mr. Shapiro said Enron and other generators will file appeals at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission asking that the new pricing formula be rescinded. It is possible the FERC may throw out the pricing formula anyway. It is expected to issue a major order on Nov. 1 directing changes in California's market structure. That order will include its determination of the effectiveness of price caps. It also is expected to judge the merits of the governance structure at the ISO, which has lately been marked by infighting. Recently, consumer groups have charged that the ISO board has put the business interests of its members ahead of members' fiduciary duty to California residents. The most recent price-cap measure was approved over the objections of executives at the ISO whose job it will be to implement the formula. ISO Chief Executive Terry Winter said the measure is flawed because it doesn't take into account the amount of power available to the California market. Mr. Winter fears the caps will place the state at a disadvantage relative to neighboring states with no price caps. About 11 states are electrically interconnected in the West, meaning power can be moved between them and chase the highest prices. ""We keep getting accused of making our market too complicated,"" Mr. Winter said. ""Then along comes this proposal"" with caps that would adjust repeatedly throughout the day, depending on demand.

Enron Offers Cash To Help Azurix Take Itself Private By Rebecca Smith Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 10/30/2000 The Wall Street Journal A12 (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) Enron Corp. offered to lend Azurix Corp., an Enron spinoff, $275 million so that it could take itself private. Enron, which has been frustrated with the global water company's performance, suggested Friday that public shareholders receive a cash offer of $7 a share for their Azurix stock. While nearly double the stock's value prior to the offer, the suggested price nevertheless was far below the $19 at which Azurix made its debut in 1999. An Azurix spokeswoman said the board, on which Enron has seats, had not yet decided how to treat the Enron offer. An Enron spokesman said that taking the company private would ""give us more opportunity to directly affect our investment."" In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Azurix soared $3 to $6.56 in heavy trading. Azurix had hoped to create a splash by doing to the water business what Enron had done to the energy business -- increase competition and provide trading skills capable of creating new financial products out of old commodities. But Azurix stumbled, nearly from the outset. Deregulation of the water business and government privatizations of water systems, on which it was counting, were slow to come, crimping growth opportunities and profit. And Enron, accustomed to higher, faster returns, grew impatient with the capital-intensive water business. The company's first chief executive, Rebecca Mark, a onetime head of Enron's international division, resigned in the summer with the agreement of Enron executives, who said it was time for new leadership. The incoming chief executive, John Garrison, said he would look for buyers for some of the company's businesses; he was unavailable to comment Friday. Ms. Mark was believed to be considering making an offer for some of those businesses, herself. She declined a request for an interview. In its letter to Azurix officers, Enron said the water company received four offers from prospective suitors after Ms. Mark's departure, the best of which came from an unidentified bidder who offered $7 a share and went through a lengthy due-diligence process before backing down, apparently spooked by Azurix's cash flow, capital structure, tax considerations and some securities litigation. In its proposal letter, made public Friday, Enron said it concluded ""that there is no other buyer willing to pay the $7"" and so proceeded with its own offer. But Enron said it won't try to limit Azurix's ability to negotiate a better deal with others, should they come forward. Finally, Enron noted that Azurix had considered various partial or full-liquidation alternatives but said they didn't seem likely to produce more than $7 a share.

Business Wessex switch likely Adam Jones in New York 10/28/2000 The Times of London News International 2W 64 (Copyright Times Newspapers Ltd, 2000) Wessex Water's American parent company is likely to be taken private after a disastrous 14-month spell as a quoted company. Wessex, which provides water services to the South of England, was bought by Azurix in 1998 for Pounds 1.6 billion. Azurix wanted to use Wessex's expertise in privatised water supply to build a global business. However, since listing at $19 a share in June last year, Azurix stock has gone into freefall, closing at less than $4 earlier this week. Azurix slumped because it drastically misjudged the number of privatisation opportunities. It emerged last night that Enron, the Texan energy and trading company that is Azurix's biggest shareholder, has taken the unusual step of offering to lend Azurix $275 million (Pounds 190 million) to buy its publicly held shares, thereby taking it private. The Enron proposal would value Azurix at about $800 million or $7 per share - 63 per cent less than the IPO price. Enron would control Azurix and Wessex Water if it went private. Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. BUSINESS Enron water unit could go private under loan plan NELSON ANTOSH Staff 10/28/2000 Houston Chronicle 3 STAR 1 (Copyright 2000) Enron offered Friday to lend Azurix, its struggling water affiliate, about $275 million so Azurix can go private by purchasing 38.6 million shares that are publicly traded. The deal would have Azurix buying back its stock at $7 per share, about double what the shares were trading for Thursday. That's a big comedown for Azurix shares, which sold for $19 each when the Houston company went public in June 1999. The maneuver technically can be called a ""take-under,"" said analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities in Houston. She also described it as Enron's least painful solution for what to do with the venture that never lived up its ambitious plans. ""Nothing about Azurix has been positive for Enron, in my view,"" said Coale. ""This is a solution to a problem."" Azurix spokeswoman Diane Bazelides said its board is studying Enron's proposal. She added that it was too early to comment on the offer because the proposal's structure had not been outlined. Enron imposed no deadline for a decision by Azurix, but reserved the right to withdraw the offer if Azurix's position with prospective customers and employees deteriorated. One of Enron's conditions is that Azurix not sell any major assets before the buyout. The deal would not change Enron's large stake in Azurix, said Palmer. It owns a third, while the other third is owned by the Atlantic Water Trust, in which Enron owns a 50 percent voting interest. The proposal's advantages include giving public shareholders a premium to the market price, said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. The common stock of Azurix zoomed Friday on the news, gaining $3 to close at $6.56 on the New York Stock Exchange. Becoming a private company would give Azurix management greater flexibility in restructuring. Coale said it would reduce Azurix's general and administrative costs, helping it to bid against lower- cost foreign competition, particularly two big French companies. Azurix's high cost structure has been its primary problem, she said. Azurix has been looking at cost and strategies ever since it got a new president and chief executive on Aug. 25, said Bazelides. That was the date that Rebecca Mark resigned as Azurix's high-profile chairman and chief executive. Enron and Azurix have been looking at ""strategic alternatives"" for nine months, J. Mark Meets, Enron's executive vice president for corporate development, said in a letter filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. One alternative was selling the company, he said. That didn't work out because the offers from three companies didn't exceed $4 per share. The fourth potential buyer said it would consider offering $7 per share, said Meets. But that suitor backed out, citing reasons like cash flow, complexity of the capital structure, tax considerations and pending securities litigation. ""We are obviously quite disappointed by this most recent turn of events,"" Meets said in the letter. ""However, we strongly believe that there is no other buyer willing to pay the $7 per share initially proposed (but later withdrawn) by the fourth bidder."" Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Ken Herman American-Statesman Capitol Bureau Chief 10/28/2000 Austin American-Statesman A1 (Copyright 2000) Not long ago, at a glossy wooden table in a Texas Capitol office, two of Gov. George W. Bush's high-level appointees discussed one of the key issues in state government these days. It involved the relative merits of White House posts that could be available to the two appointees if Bush becomes president. Asked this week whether it's a common topic around the Capitol, one of the appointees gestured to the anteroom of his office and made a motion indicating that even the midlevel folks have Washington on their minds. Near the banks of the Colorado, Potomac Fever is a near-epidemic. And though it is political faux pas to be too open about doing White House transition planning before Election Day, be assured it is going on at Bush headquarters, where top officials are cognizant of the fine line between looking too confident now and looking too unprepared later. The candidate himself -- as well as his top aides -- steers clear of transition talk. When asked who might wind up in his Cabinet, Bush looks backward instead of forward, saying that his selection of Dick Cheney as his running mate should offer a glimpse of the kind of people who would wind up in his administration. The transition work, such that it is, is under the aegis of longtime Bush friend and aide Clay Johnson, who began as head of the gubernatorial appointments office and now serves as chief of staff. Johnson said nobody has been interviewed for any Washington post, but he has compiled a file of folks who are interested in serving in a Bush administration. Johnson also has been reading up on previous transitions -- ones that went well and ones that didn't. His preliminary conclusion is that the outgoing administrations are generally helpful and supportive, even if they were ousted by the incoming administration. It's the incoming administrations that can make the mistakes, he said. There is no shortage of think tanks that have think-tanked the topic. Back in August, the Heritage Foundation, based in Washington, issued a transition handbook titled ""The Keys to a Successful Presidency."" ""Though we really don't expect either campaign to talk about it (and would discourage them from doing so), the message here is it's time to start planning for a possible presidential transition, quietly, well behind the scenes, but with the understanding that the preparation done during the next 70 or so days, and the work done in the 70 or so days that follow (between the election and the inauguration) will very well determine the initial success or failure of the next administration,"" Herbert Berkowitz, a foundation vice president, said in releasing the study. All indications are that the Bush team has been following the advice, with Johnson at the helm. Johnson cautions against expectations that a Bush administration would be overloaded with Texans. ""It's the United States of America, not the United States of Texas,"" he said. Despite that caveat, there is no shortage of Texans who are considered shoo-ins to fill some of the thousands of slots Bush could offer if he wins. Johnson confirms that he is very interested in a Washington job. Early speculation among Bush aides makes Johnson a potential leading contender for head of personnel at the White House. Karen Hughes, Bush's communications director since his 1994 gubernatorial campaign, is expected to become Bush's press secretary if he wins the White House. Karl Rove, Bush's longtime political guru, also will be on board, though he could wind up with an out-of- the-White-House post, perhaps at the Republican National Committee. Not as certain is the potential future for Joe Allbaugh, who is part of the ""iron triangle"" of top advisers -- along with Rove and Hughes -- who have been on board with Bush since the 1994 campaign. Allbaugh serves as manager of the presidential campaign and previously served as chief of staff in the governor's office. Capitol speculation indicates Allbaugh could decide to skip a White House post, possibly in favor of a lobbying job, if he is not tapped as chief of staff. That post could go to Don Evans, a longtime Bush friend who headed the megasuccessful fund-raising effort for the presidential campaign. However, not everyone has Potomac Fever. For example, Terral Smith, Bush's legislative director, said he will stay in Austin to lobby. In addition to the speculation about appointees, the approaching election has sparked talk about when Bush might leave office if he wins. Under the U.S. Constitution, he could remain governor until he has to become president on Jan. 20. Much more likely, however, is that Bush would leave office sooner than that, perhaps as soon as two or three weeks after the Nov. 7 election, if he wins. That could cause a housing problem for Bush, whose main residence is the Governor's Mansion, which comes as a free perk of the job. The Bushes have a home under construction at their ranch in Crawford, near Waco. The ranch also has a smaller house in which the Bushes now spend weekends. Not out of the question is that Bush could work out an arrangement with Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, who would become governor if Bush resigns, to remain in the Governor's Mansion for several weeks after he leaves office. If the race among Texas senators to replace Perry as lieutenant governor complicates the timing of the resignation, Bush could stay in the governor's office a little longer, but no later than the first week of January. After all, he will want to give Perry time to bask in his gubernatorial inauguration before the Legislature convenes Jan. 9. No matter when Bush resigns, confidantes believe he might use his Crawford ranch for interviews with potential top-level appointees, including Cabinet members.

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A Dynegy executive said Friday that the California Independent System Operator's plan to impose hourly price caps on the wholesale power market will compromise reliability by forcing generators to sell electricity out of state. ""If the ISO says it will not buy above a certain price and generators cannot operate below that price, then we have no choice but to find other markets to participate in,"" said Dynegy senior vice president of marketing and trading asset management Lynn Lednicky. ""That may lead to the ISO not finding the power it needs at a price it wants to pay."" The ISO plans to construct hourly price caps each month based on forecast load, natural gas prices and generation unit efficiency. The caps will take effect Nov. 3 or soon therafter. Dynegy Inc. (DYN) sent a letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission asking it to address reliability consequences of the price caps before Nov. 3. Dynegy specifically requested that FERC discuss the issue at its Nov. 1 meeting, when it will release a report on California's electricity problems. Enron Corp. (ENE) and Southern Company (SO) share Dynegy's concerns about reliability and plan to petition FERC about the issue, said a trader listening in to a conference call between the three companies. -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872; jessica.berthold@dowjones.com Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. SEC Filing Shows 3rd Parties Contacted Enron About Azurix By Christopher C. Williams 10/27/2000 Dow Jones News Service (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES New York -(Dow Jones)- Shares of Azurix Corp. (AZX) jumped 84% in heavy trading Friday after parent Enron Corp. (ENE) proposed to take the company private in a $7-a-share buyout. Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that Enron made the proposal after not being satisfied with offers it had received from four third parties for its stake in Azurix. In a letter to two members of Azurix's board, Enron said three potential buyers ""were unlikely to be willing to pay more than the then-current market price of approximately $4 a share."" Enron said a fourth potential buyer indicated it would consider a $7-a-share offer, but it said that proposal was recently withdrawn. ""The reasons given by the bidder included pro forma cash flows, the complexity of the capital structure, tax considerations and the currently pending securities litigation,"" the letter said. Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Houston-based Enron, declined to say whether Enron was entertaining current third-party interests or was in any talks with other parties regarding its Azurix stake. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Azurix ended Friday up $3 to $6.56 on 2.8 million shares, compared with average daily volume of 239,000 shares. Enron was up $1.38, or 1.8%, to $78.88 on 1.6 million shares, compared with its daily average turnover of 2.4 million. In the SEC filing, Enron, saying it's familiar with Azurix's various partial and full liquidation alternatives, said its buyout proposal is conditioned upon Azurix not selling any significant assets prior to the buyout. ""Although we agree that such plans may result in greater value to Azurix's shareholders than the maintenance of the status quo, we believe that these options almost certainly will not result on a present value in a greater return to Azurix's shareholders than $7 a share,"" the letter said. Enron also said its buyout proposal doesn't include any breakup fees or other ""deal protection devices."" This frees Azurix's board to pursue an acquisition that ""might provide greater value"" to shareholders. Daine Bazelides, a spokeswoman for Azurix, declined to say whether Azurix is now entertaining offers for the company. She did, however, confirm the information contained in Enron's filing. ""The historical information in the filing is factually correct,"" she told Dow Jones Newswires. She said she doesn't know when Azurix board will respond to Enron's proposal. In the filing, Enron didn't set a deadline, but warned that Azurix's position with customers and employees may deteriorate further. ""We must therefore reserve the right to withdraw our proposal at any time,"" Enron's letter said. In the letter, Enron pointed out that Azurix had retained two ""internationally recognized investment bankers"" early this year to evaluate strategic alternatives, which included the potential sale of the company to unrelated third parties. Enron said it strongly believes there isn't another buyer willing to pay $7 a share for Enron's indirect interest in Azurix. ""We believe it is in Azurix's best interest, as well as the best interest of its shareholders and employees, if Azurix were no longer a publicly traded company,"" Enron said. -By Christopher C. Williams, Dow Jones Newswires, 201-938-5219; christopher.williams@dowjones.com Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Enron offers to buy out Azurix Financial Times By Hillary Durgin in Houston Published: October 27 2000 23:31GMT | Last Updated: October 27 2000 23:36GMT Enron, the Houston-based energy and trading group, said on Friday it had offered up to $275m in funding to take Azurix private at a buy-out price of $7 per share. The specific structure of Enron's proposal has yet to be determined, Enron said. Azurix said its board would now consider the proposal. The timing of any decision was unclear. Enron owns directly and indirectly about 66 per cent of Azurix, the troubled Houston water company, whose main asset is UK-based Wessex Water. The buyout offer is the latest development in a history of problems at Azurix, which was spun off from Enron and taken public at an offering price of $19 per share. But a combination of poor market timing, competitive industry conditions and empty promises by the company on Wall Street took their toll on the company, whose shares have since plummeted and have been trading most recently around the $3-per-share range. In August, Rebecca Mark, Azurix chief executive officer, resigned both from Azurix and from the board at Enron. Enron's offer came after four unnamed parties approached Enron about buying its stake in Azurix. While three of the four were unwilling to pay more than the then market price of about $4 per share, a fourth party who was considering offering $7 per share (before accounting for any dilution for stock options) later declined to pursue the transaction, Enron said in Friday's letter to Azurix, outlining the buyout proposal. ""We strongly believe that our proposal is fair to Azurix's public stockholders,"" the letter stated. ""Our proposed transaction would permit Azurix's stockholders to receive, on a timely basis, a cash payment for their shares that is significantly above the price at which those shares have traded in several months."" Analysts that follow Azurix and had valued the shares at between $6 and $8 per shares said the offer was fair. Analysts that follow Enron said that Azurix's business strategy had proved to be a failure and was characteristic of the hard asset approach that Enron has gradually distanced itself from. Enron's shares closed at $78.88 up $1.38 on Friday. Azurix's shares rose $3 to close at $6.56.",1,"Company Business, Strategy, etc."

Elizabeth, Jeff forwarded me your questions about capacity options.  I've 
answered them to the extent they involve legal/regulatory issues.  If you 
need anything further please don't hesitate to call.

?  Can a new shipper who enters into an FTS-1 contract with zero MDQ in order 
to purchase a shipper call option or sell a transporter put option be 
allowed, prior to the exercise date, to transfer the underlying option rights 
by permanently releasing this contract?    YES.

?   Will we be required to report these contracts with zero MDQ on the Index 
of Customers and/or the Transactional Report?  YES.

? Can the releasing shipper permanently release a portion of his existing MDQ 
and choose to keep or transfer the option rights?   YES.  The shipper could 
even release all of its MDQ (reducing it to zero) and keep its option rights.

? How is it determined whether a contract with an option amendment is within 
the min/max tariff rate or needs to be filed as a negotiated rate?  The 
option fee is converted to a per-Dth, per day rate and added to the transport 
rate.  If the total exceeds the maximum tariff rate, it's ""negotiated"".  
Otherwise, our position is that it's not negotiated.  We are not 100% 
positive that FERC will agree with us on this issue.","PRIVILEGED & CONFIDENTIAL Attorney/Client Communication: Your TW Capacity Options questions.

Steve and Rick,

EES is considering ""re-sourcing"" the new customers in SDG&E's area -- because 
of the uncertainty over whether the CA Procurement Charge will apply to those 
customers.  I think this proposed action needs to be evaluated from a 
nationwide perspective -- this has long-term negative implications for 
Enron's credibility in the DA market as a whole.

2.  What is the process that is followed to make such a determination?
3.  Which individuals or groups are involved in determining whether an 
operational sale is necessary?
4.  In what way have system operations changed since last year and how do 
those changes contribute to the increased frequency of such sales compared to 
previous years?
5. What alternatives to operational sales are considered before the decision

Subject: Entry tax to dergulating markets



The Forbes April 30, 2001 editorial piece ""Slow Starters"" on page 24 discusses
the ""entry tax"" which is the capital burden for starting a new business.  It 
states that rich countries
on average have relatively low entry costs while poor countries have 
stagering entry costs caused
by corruption, endless beuacracy, and cost of delays.  These ""entry hurdles"" 
and asscoiated costs
do not produce any tangible benefits for consumers, workers or the 
environment.

We might want to make the analogy of ""entry tax"" for new deregulated gas & 
power markets.  Things like
negotiated third-party access (rather than regulated TPA) substantially slow 
the speed of new entrants and hence deter competition.
Negotiated TPA creates uncertainty for new entrants (they never know what 
they are going to get) and clearly slows
the new comers down.

I will send you a copy of the Forbes piece.

John

		 Subject: CFTC Chair

Jim Newsome is currently the Interim Chair of the Commodities Futures Trading 
Commission (CFTC).  He was appointed in 1998 to term which expires in June 
2001.  Commissioner Newsome visited Enron in 1999 and will again visit Enron 
to meet with Jeff Skilling (also EnronOnLine executives) on March 6, 2001.

The CFTC has 5 Commissioners.  Commissioners Newsome and Spears are 
Republicans and Commissioners Erickson and Holum are Democrats, with one 
opening.  If Newsome becomes Chair, then there will be two open seats.  If 
Newsome if passed over, there will only be open seat. 

Commissioner Newsome has the support of Majority Trent Lott.  He is well 
liked in industry because of his free market philosophy and belief in 
competition and deregulation.  While not a technical expert, he is a ""known 
quantity"" at the Commission.  Newsome played a major role in the Commodities 
Futures Modernization Act (CFMA) which became law last Congress.  This law 
brought legal certainty and modernization to the commodity trading 
community.  With Newsome, industry is consulted before regulations are 
issued.  Industry generally believes that Commission Newsome is the right 
candidate to oversee the CFMA rulekmaking which is currently underway.

The other candidate for the position was former North Carolina Senator Lauch 
Faircloth whose nomination was being championed by Senator Phil Gramm 
(R-TX).  We have learned that Faircloth has lost interest, because he would 
have to divest sizeable interest in agriculture holdings.  The concern now is 
that because this is a third tier appointment,  unknown candidates will 
suddenly appear without industry input.  A quick nomination and confirmation 
of Commissioner Newsome as Chairman is recommended by many in the industry.

Do you think it appropriate to have Ken Lay raise this nomination with the 
transition team?

In light of the Commerce Committee Hearing and the FERC Hearing on the 11th 
and 12th, wanted to provide a quick synopsis of the CPUC Hearing in SD.

It was the same quasi-legislative format as the previous hearing.  Speakers 
were invited by the Commission and only the ALJ and the Commissioners could 
cross-examine the witnesses.  Commissioners Lynch and Wood presided.  Michael 
Kahn, chairman of the Electricity Oversight Board was there and participated 
in some cross-examination as well.

Speakers were:

ISO:  
Kellan Fluckiger, COO
Anjali Sheffrin, Director of Market Analysis
Frank Wolak, Chairman of Market Surveillance Committee

Cal PX:
David Jermain, former VP, Compliance, Audits & Reg. Affairs
Seth Wilson, 

South Coast Air Quality Management District:
Carol Coy, Deputy Executive Director

CPUC:
Harvey Morris, Principal Attorney

SDG&E:
Donald Garber

ISO's main message was that many factors contribute to the high prices in the 
wholesale market:

 1.  Demand growth over past two years at or around 5% (98-99, 99-00)
 2.  Lack of generation additions in entire west
 3.  Reduced imports of electricity from NW, due to low hydro and policy to 
retain water in spring.
 4.  Natural Gas price increases over 1999, at almost 2x's 1999 levels in 
August
 5.  Nox emissions trading at or around $40/pound
 6.  Increased underscheduling from June-August

ISO has concluded that the reduction in the price caps (from $500 to $250) 
have increased the overall cost of electricity, with the highest total 
cost/MWh ($180) experienced in August, relative to $167/MWh in June and $118 
in July.  Reason given is that the caps have reduced markup (could be 
interpreted as generator profit) in peak hours, but supply costs have been 
driven up in lower load hours.  

While ISO staff said they will seek an extension of its authority from FERC 
to be set price caps, also raised concerns about the affect any further 
reductions would have on the market.  They conclude that such a reduction 
would deter new investment,  preclude generators from recovering fixed costs 
of production, and increase dependence on OOM purchases (as a result of lower 
imports).

ISO staff will make a proposal to the ISO Board, October 6, to do the 
following:

1.  File for extension of price cap authority to FERC.
2.  Request FERC to institute mandatory forward contract requirement on 
generators for a significant portion of their capacity.
3.  CPUC should allow full peak requirements to be forward contracted and 
hedged by UDCs
4.  CPUC and state should promote price responsive demand programs
5.  Maintain sufficient planning reserves.

ISO Staff also stated that:

1.  Need to create disincentive for underscheduling for load and generation
 a.  Charge OOM cost to underscheduled load
 b.  Charge replacement reserve cost to underscheduled generation
 c.  Additional charge for real-time market transactions

2.  Attract and expedite new resources

MARKET POWER:

While the Commissioners spent the majority of the day picking apart the 
underlying reasons for the rise in prices, the conclusion of the hearing was 
President Lynch asking the ISO and PX to name names on who has been exerting 
market power.  Both the PX and the ISO said that it would be impossible to 
determine from the information they have.  Secondly, the analysis they have 
done show that no single market participant is consistently exhibiting the 
ability (opportunity) to exercise market power.  Therefore, at one point or 
another, nearly every market participant has market power.

Wolak suggested that in order to reduce the amount of market power in peak 
periods, require forward contracting OR increase profit incentives in 
off-peak period, where generators many times sell below short-run marginal 
costs.

No further quasi-legislative hearings are planned.","CPUC Hearing in SD on 9/8. In light of the Commerce Committee Hearing and the FERC Hearing on the 11th and 12th, wanted to provide a quick synopsis of the CPUC Hearing in SD. It was the same quasi-legislative format as the previous hearing. Speakers were invited by the Commission and only the ALJ and the Commissioners could cross-examine the witnesses. Commissioners Lynch and Wood presided. Michael Kahn, chairman of the Electricity Oversight Board was there and participated in some cross-examination as well. Speakers were: ISO: Kellan Fluckiger, COO Anjali Sheffrin, Director of Market Analysis Frank Wolak, Chairman of Market Surveillance Committee Cal PX: David Jermain, former VP, Compliance, Audits & Reg. Affairs Seth Wilson, South Coast Air Quality Management District: Carol Coy, Deputy Executive Director CPUC: Harvey Morris, Principal Attorney SDG&E: Donald Garber ISO's main message was that many factors contribute to the high prices in the wholesale market: 1. Demand growth over past two years at or around 5% (98-99, 99-00) 2. Lack of generation additions in entire west 3. Reduced imports of electricity from NW, due to low hydro and policy to retain water in spring. 4. Natural Gas price increases over 1999, at almost 2x's 1999 levels in August 5. Nox emissions trading at or around $40/pound 6. Increased underscheduling from June-August ISO has concluded that the reduction in the price caps (from $500 to $250) have increased the overall cost of electricity, with the highest total cost/MWh ($180) experienced in August, relative to $167/MWh in June and $118 in July. Reason given is that the caps have reduced markup (could be interpreted as generator profit) in peak hours, but supply costs have been driven up in lower load hours. While ISO staff said they will seek an extension of its authority from FERC to be set price caps, also raised concerns about the affect any further reductions would have on the market. They conclude that such a reduction would deter new investment, preclude generators from recovering fixed costs of production, and increase dependence on OOM purchases (as a result of lower imports).

It looks like we are playing a smaller role than the WSJ article indicates -- 
i.e. a role commensurate with our level of interest.  I have talked with John 
several times about the relative importance of OPIC, ExIm and other funding 
organizations in light of the change in emphasis in our business.  As a 
result of those discussions we cut headcount and expenditures from the 
proposed budget for ""01 and John has joined Linda Robertson's organization in 
the DC office (instead of being a stand alone effort).  Having said that, my 
view (based on the work John has been doing) is that we continue to have a 
considerable amount of work for him to do on the project finance front as a 
result of existing projects, projects we continue to pursue, and transfer 
issues associated with the asset sales.  Do you agree?

 This is not a battle to fight with OMB, but we have to show the agencies 
that we are supportive of  their programs and their budgets.  We are not 
going to lead the battle and in fact have not particpated in meetings on the 
hill.  But we are in negotiations with both EXIM and OPIC on Electrobolt and 
will need their support on our problem projects.  Also, Rebecca McDonald is 
on EXIM's private sector advisory committee.  If you need more lets talk.

Exporters Rush to Ex-Im Bank's Defense --- Lobby Campaign to Prevent Budget 
Cuts Seeks Help Of 100,000 Small Firms

WASHINGTON -- Angry and confused that a Republican administration has 
targeted one of their favorite programs for big cuts, America's largest 
exporters are appealing for help from lawmakers. 
Boeing Co., Caterpillar Inc., Enron Corp., Halliburton Co. and others are 
launching an aggressive lobbying campaign on Capitol Hill to protect the 
Export-Import Bank from budget reductions; the White House labels the Ex-Im 
Bank as corporate welfare.
""The administration has fired its shot, and now we're firing ours,"" said 
Edmund B. Rice, president of the Coalition for Employment Through Exports, an 
industry group that is leading the effort. 
Since they got wind of the proposed cuts a few weeks ago, business lobbyists 
have been trying to rally sympathetic lawmakers. And executives at Boeing, 
Caterpillar and other big companies plan to contact some 100,000 smaller 
suppliers that benefit indirectly from the $12.6 billion of export loans, 
guarantees and insurance that Ex-Im Bank provided in the last fiscal year. 
Those small companies, the executives hope, will create a groundswell of 
support in Congress for the Ex-Im Bank. 
""Companies large and small who have similar interests here are banding 
together to provide an educational effort so people understand the impact of 
this,"" said Chris Hansen, Boeing senior vice president for government 
relations. 
Corporate lobbyists also have dug up a speech that Vice President Dick 
Cheney, while chief executive of Halliburton, gave in 1997 praising the bank 
and scoffing at those who consider it a giveaway to big business. They plan 
to pass Mr. Cheney's comments to influential members of Congress this week. 
""We'll be circulating them very broadly,"" Mr. Rice said. 
A spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney had no immediate comment. 
Ex-Im Bank officials aren't talking publicly, avoiding the appearance that 
they are battling the White House to overturn the proposed 25% cut in the 
bank's $865 million operating budget for the current fiscal year, which ends 
Sept. 30. But an Ex-Im official said the topic has come up in conversations 
between key lawmakers and Ex-Im Bank Chairman James A. Harmon, who is soon to 
be succeeded by Mel Sembler, a Bush campaign fund-raiser and a 
shopping-center developer. 
At first, business lobbyists assumed administration budgeteers were just 
looking for savings anywhere they could find it. Before President Bush 
released his spending plan last week, companies appealed to Mitchell Daniels, 
head of the White House budget office, in an attempt to keep the Ex-Im Bank 
cuts out of the final proposal. 
The Ex-Im Bank's corporate clients include some of the country's largest 
political contributors. Boeing, the bank's largest user, received $3.3 
billion of financing last year. The Seattle aerospace company and its 
employees contributed $1.8 million to politicians and parties during the 2000 
election cycle, 61% to Republicans, according to federal election data 
assembled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Caterpillar, a Peoria, Ill., 
maker of engines and heavy equipment that secured seven Ex-Im Bank deals last 
year, and its employees contributed more than $500,000 -- 96% to Republicans. 
Company officials deny they wanted to leverage donations to try to secure 
political support for the Ex-Im Bank. 
Many lobbyists have come to the conclusion that administration officials -- 
those of a libertarian persuasion -- oppose Ex-Im Bank as a form of welfare 
for corporations. Indeed, the White House budget plan criticized the bank's 
operations as unjustified public subsidies for companies. ""That makes it a 
much more serious issue,"" Mr. Rice said. ""We're concerned that the 
administration seems to be turning its attention in this direction."" 
Barring intervention from Mr. Cheney, business groups now have largely given 
up hope of convincing the White House to back down, planning instead to use 
their muscle to convince Congress to restore the Ex-Im Bank's funding. Bank 
officials and U.S. companies argue that, far from being a subsidy, the bank 
simply allows American companies to compete with European and Japanese firms 
that receive assistance from their own governments. 
""In many markets in Asia and Africa, the bank is absolutely critical to our 
ability to sell American-made products,"" said Bill Lane, Caterpillar's 
Washington director for governmental affairs.

No Problem, Houston 
CENTURY DEVELOPMENT is about to announce plans to break ground on downtown 
Houston's third major office development in less than three years. In another 
sign of the strength of the city's energy sector, Century is finalizing a 
headquarters deal with Reliant Resources Inc. to take more than two-thirds of 
the project's 850,000 square feet, says Edwin Murphy, a Century senior vice 
president. 
Two other towers also are underway. In 1999, Hines began building a 1.2 
million square-foot tower for Enron Corp. and late last year Crescent Real 
Estate Equities broke ground on a 27-story tower that will be anchored by 
Ernst & Young. These three projects are the first major downtown office 
projects to get underway since 1986. 
The surge is part of a renaissance of downtown Houston, where new sports 
facilities, hotels, apartment buildings and restaurants have been mushrooming 
in recent years. ""The new amenities have kept people from leaving and enticed 
people to come back,"" says Michael Hassler, of CB Richard Ellis.

Dutch Gas Competition Grows Despite Sluggish Reforms
By Germana Canzi
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

03/07/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- The Netherlands is emerging as an important testing 
ground for E.U. gas liberalization, as new trading hubs for competitive, 
short-term gas supplies from the U.K. and Norway emerge on the Belgian and 
German borders. 
However, much remains to be done. A group of large energy users and traders 
is preparing to confront Gasunie Thursday in a hearing organized by the 
regulator. The main issues of contention are the balancing system, which 
Gasunie conducts on an hourly basis, the extent to which transport tariffs 
are cost-focused and third-party access to storage facilities.
The emergence of competition in the Dutch gas sector is mostly due to the 
initiative of new market entrants who, despite a difficult regulatory 
environment, have managed to develop a market for short-term gas virtually 
from scratch. 
If liquidity improves in these emerging hubs, the Netherlands could become an 
important transit country for freely tradeable gas supplies to other 
countries in northwest Europe, as well as being an important market in its 
own right. However, the difficulty of implementing transparent third-party 
access systems in the Netherlands and in neighboring Germany casts a dark 
cloud over recent progress in competition. 
Since December, Enron Europe Ltd. (U.ENE), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK), E.On AG 
(EON), RWE AG (G.RWE) and Electrabel SA (B.ELE) have been actively buying and 
selling gas, sourced in the U.K., the Netherlands and Norway, in a number of 
hubs between Emden in Germany and Emshaven and Oude Statenzijl in the 
Netherlands. 
David Gallagher, head of European gas trading at Enron in London, estimates 
that at least one trade a day of around 100,000 therms for a quarterly 
contract is done at the Oude Statenzijl hub, where the Gasunie pipeline 
system connects to the network of Wingas GmbH. 
An important element kick-starting short-term trading was the sale, in 
December 2000, of a 2 billion cubic meter a year Norwegian gas supply 
contract to five Dutch-based power generators. 
Robert van der Hoeven, head of fuel procurement at Electrabel, the owner of 
Dutch generator EPON, said his company uses most of the gas it imports from 
Norway for its plants in the Netherlands and trades the rest on a short-term 
basis in the Oude-Emden area. This pattern is common to the other Dutch-based 
parties to that contract. 
Trading in Dutch hubs received a further boost when Nederlandse Gasunie NV 
(N.NEG) decided, after months of wrangling with regulator DTe, to lower its 
transport tariffs by 6.5% from January 2001 and to unbundle its combined 
commodity and service tariff, the so-called CSS system, from July 2001. 
Gasunie now claims its pipeline system is fully open and transparent. To 
prove this, it says it has lost 30% of its customers in the eligible market, 
but that figure hasn't changed much since March 2000. Small wonder that 
critics say the switching figure doesn't necessarily indicate an ideal system 
of third-party access. 
According to energy consultants The Brattle Group, around half of the gas 
used by alternative suppliers goes through the 1 bcm/year Zebra pipeline from 
Zelzate to Zeeland, which was built by Dutch utilities a few years ago 
precisely because Gasunie refused to provide access on favorable terms. 
Shippers have complained that the hourly system used by Gasunie to balance 
the pipeline system raises the overall cost of shipping through its network 
significantly. Gasunie imposes a balancing charge which effectively forces 
shippers to pay for the extra gas brought into the system from storage sites, 
in addition to the capacity and transmission price. Critics say Gasunie has 
so far failed to unbundle these charges, although it agreed to do so in 
January. 
According to the Brattle Group, another controversial aspect of Gasunie's 
tariff system is that it is based on theoretical costs of constructing new 
pipelines rather than its actual costs. 
The DTe is also considering ways of reforming the storage system to make it 
competitive. BP PLC (U.BP) and Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij NV operate 
storage facilities and lease capacity to Gasunie through long-term contracts. 
The regulator is studying ways of allowing third parties access to storage 
facilities. Gasunie has so far shown little sign of negotiating more 
competitive tariffs with storage operators and passing on the benefits to 
customers, critics say. 
The growth of short-term trading in the Dutch gas market is also inevitably 
linked to its potential as a transit country for gas coming from the 
U.K.-Belgium gas interconnector and going towards the 82bcm-a-year German 
market. 
Market participants say liquidity at the Emden and Oude hubs has grown 
considerably since E.On and RWE started trading there earlier this year. 
However, the obstructive attitude of incumbents toward third-party access 
there has meant that so far most gas traded in the Netherlands has remained 
there.

USA: Big U.S. exporters to fight Ex-Im Bank cuts - WSJ.

03/07/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, March 7 (Reuters) - America's largest exporters are launching an 
aggressive lobbying campaign on Capitol Hill to protect the Export-Import 
Bank from budget reductions, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online 
edition on Wednesday. 
The exporters, including Boeing Co. , Caterpillar Inc. , Enron Corp. , 
Halliburton Co. and others, are angry and confused that a Republican 
administration has targeted one of their favourite programmes for big cuts, 
the paper reported.
Ex-Im Bank officials were not talking publicly, avoiding the appearance that 
they are battling the White House to overturn the proposed 25 percent cut in 
the bank's $865 million operating budget for the current fiscal year, which 
ends Sept 30, it said. 
The White House labels the Ex-Im Bank as corporate welfare. 
""The administration has fired its shot, and now we're firing ours,"" Edmund 
Rice, president of the Coalition for Employment Through Exports, an industry 
group that is leading the effort, was quoted as saying by the paper. 
Executives at Boeing, Caterpillar and other big companies plan to contact 
some 100,000 smaller suppliers who benefit indirectly from the $12.6 billion 
of export loans, guarantees and insurance that Ex-Im Bank provided in the 
last fiscal year, the paper said. 
Those small companies, the executives hope, will create a groundswell of 
support in Congress for the Ex-Im Bank, it said.

Major U.S. Exporters Rush to Export-Import Bank's Defense

Dow Jones Business News

WASHINGTON -- Angry and confused that a Republican administration has 
targeted one of their favorite programs for big cuts, America's largest 
exporters are appealing for help from lawmakers, Wednesday's Wall Street 
Journal reported. 
Boeing Co. (BA), Caterpillar Inc. (CAT), Enron Corp. (ENE), Halliburton Co. 
(HAL) and others are launching an aggressive lobbying campaign on Capitol 
Hill to protect the Export-Import Bank from budget reductions; the White 
House labels the Ex-Im Bank as corporate welfare.
""The administration has fired its shot, and now we're firing ours,"" said 
Edmund B. Rice, president of the Coalition for Employment Through Exports, an 
industry group that is leading the effort. 
Since they got wind of the proposed cuts a few weeks ago, business lobbyists 
have been trying to rally sympathetic lawmakers. And executives at Boeing, 
Caterpillar and other big companies plan to contact some 100,000 smaller 
suppliers that benefit indirectly from the $12.6 billion of export loans, 
guarantees and insurance that Ex-Im Bank provided in the last fiscal year. 
Those small companies, the executives hope, will create a groundswell of 
support in Congress for the Ex-Im Bank. 
Corporate lobbyists also have dug up a speech that Vice President Dick 
Cheney, while chief executive of Halliburton, gave in 1997 praising the bank 
and scoffing at those who consider it a giveaway to big business. They plan 
to pass Mr. Cheney's comments to influential members of Congress this week. 
A spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney had no immediate comment. 
Ex-Im Bank officials aren't talking publicly, avoiding the appearance that 
they are battling the White House to overturn the proposed 25% cut in the 
bank's $865 million operating budget for the current fiscal year, which ends 
Sept. 30. But an Ex-Im official said the topic has come up in conversations 
between key lawmakers and Ex-Im Bank Chairman James A. Harmon, who is soon to 
be succeeded by Mel Sembler, a Bush campaign fund-raiser and a 
shopping-center developer.

Deal with state could take until 2002 to close
By LESLIE GORNSTEIN
AP Business Writer

03/06/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

LOS ANGELES (AP) - A tentative deal aimed at rescuing Southern California 
Edison from insolvency might not close in time to prevent the utility from 
begging creditors for more patience, Edison officials said Tuesday. 
The utility's tentative, $2.7 billion agreement to sell its power lines to 
the state could take until 2002 to be consummated, thanks to complicated 
legal issues and other paperwork, an Edison official told bondholders Tuesday.
Once the deal is signed, Edison will try to borrow against the promised cash, 
but Edison International Chief Financial Officer Ted Craver admitted the 
utility might have to ask creditors to simply wait for their money until it 
has the $2.7 billion in hand. 
Energy suppliers owed money by Edison did not immediately return calls for 
comment Tuesday. 
At least four groups of suppliers have sued Edison for millions in unpaid 
bills going back months. Edison and fellow utility Pacific Gas & Electric 
have said they have lost $13 billion on the open power market thanks to 
soaring prices paired with state-imposed price caps. 
PG&E's parent company was able to recently borrow $1 billion to pay its 
stockholders and its debuts. It did not use any of that money to pay PG&E's 
bills. 
Edison's disclosure, meanwhile, shocked state officials. 
Steve Maviglio, spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, initially declined to comment 
on the status of the Edison deal, but eventually said, regarding its closure, 
""We're optimistic it will be sooner rather than later."" 
The pacing would have nothing to do with whether fellow utilities Sempra 
Energy and PG&E also sell their transmission lines to California, Craver 
said. 
Among the things that could delay the deal's closing is Edison's need to find 
landowners on whose property its lines were built to assure no legal 
agreements are being violated by the sale. Edison would also have to pin down 
exactly what it would be selling to the state - terms that might not be 
decided until after a deal has been inked, Craver said. 
""Trust me,"" Craver said in a phone call after the conference. ""There are a 
lot of legal-type documents - stuff that you and I ... would think of as a 
bloody nightmare."" 
The disclosure comes at a time when an increasing number of power suppliers 
are suing the utility for millions in unpaid bills. 
Edison also disclosed Tuesday that two more lawsuits had landed in its lap - 
one by a group of wind-powered generators including Enron Wind, the other by 
two suppliers including New York-based Caithness Energy. 
Both suits were filed during the past five days, Edison Assistant General 
Counsel Barbara Reeves said. It was not immediately clear how much the 
complainants were seeking; neither Enron nor Caithness returned calls for 
comment. 
The two filings bring the total number of suits by renewable-energy suppliers 
against Edison to four, the utility said. The city of Long Beach and 
CalEnergy Operating Group, a geothermal supplier, have also sued for back 
payments. 
CalEnergy alone has said it is owed $45 million in November and December 
payments. 
The line sale, part of a multifaceted, tentative deal with the state that 
could save Edison from insolvency, could take anywhere from several months 
into next year, Craver said. 
The tentative deal, announced by Gov. Gray Davis Feb. 23, calls for the state 
to pay more than twice the book value for Edison's lines. 
It also would require Edison to sell cheap power to the state for a decade 
and for Edison to end its lawsuit against state regulators. The suit asserts 
that price caps imposed by the California Public Utilities Commission are 
illegal under federal law. 
Additionally, Edison's parent would have to return $420 million it collected 
from the utility over the past several years. The money was used to pay debt, 
buy back stock and pay dividends to investors. 
SCE, PG&E and Sempra have complained they are near bankruptcy because of 
soaring prices on the open market combined with the state-imposed price caps 
for consumers. 
Sempra and PG&E have yet to announce similar line-sale deals with the state, 
though they and the governor have said negotiations are ongoing. The total 
cost of the 26,000 miles of lines has been estimated at $4.5 billion to $7 
billion.

Sierra Pacific CEO Doubts SEC OK Of Enron Unit Buy-Report

03/06/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Sierra Pacific Resources (SRP) CEO Walter Higgins 
said in an interview last week that he doubts the company's $3.1 billion 
acquisition of Enron Corp.'s (ENE) utility Portland General Electric will be 
approved by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the Las Vegas Sun 
reported Tuesday. 
The SEC must find that Sierra Pacific is in a strong financial position 
before it will approve the deal, but the company is currently weakened by 
having lost millions of dollars in fuel and purchased power costs, Higgins 
said in the report.
A $311 million rate increase to cover those costs began March 1, but Higgins 
said that money would only pay back those expenses and wouldn't improve the 
company's stability to a level the SEC would find adequate, according to the 
report. 
The Public Utilities Commission can halt the rate hike and order refunds if 
it decides the hike isn't necessary. The PUC is holding hearings to determine 
the prudency of the hike, and members of the state's powerful casino and 
mining industries have filed to intervene. 
Sierra Pacific's plan to shore up its financial position through the sale of 
its 10 power plants, worth nearly $2 billion, may also be in jeopardy. The 
state Senate is considering a bill to block the sales, and Nevada Gov. Kenny 
Guinn recently sent a letter to the PUC asking that it reconsider its order 
allowing electric utilities to sell assets. 
Financial analysts have said that not allowing Sierra Pacific's two utilities 
to sell their assets would have a ripple effect on the company's financial 
position. The asset sales are tied to low-priced power contracts, and if the 
sales are canceled, the low-priced power will be gone as well. 
""If the divestiture is stopped...the state may be dealing with a much bigger 
rate increase,"" Steve Fleishman, Merrill Lynch utility analyst, told Dow 
Jones Newswires recently. 
Sierra Pacific is the parent company of electric utilities Sierra Pacific 
Power Co. and Nevada Power, which serve customers in the state's North and 
South, respectively.

Many Power Deals Announced by California Governor Still Not Final
By Jason Leopold

03/06/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Dow Jones Newswires 
LOS ANGELES -- Many of the long-term power-supply contracts announced by 
California Gov. Gray Davis this week remain under negotiation or are the 
subject of ongoing lawsuits, power suppliers said Tuesday.
The lack of finality to the deals raises questions about the state's success 
in covering its power needs, particularly going into what is expected to be 
an unusually tight summer. 
Generators said privately they were surprised the governor went ahead with 
his announcement Monday, given that many of the contracts haven't been 
signed. 
David Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power, who negotiated the contracts on behalf of the state, conceded that 
details remain to be worked out. ""This is not a done deal,"" Mr. Freeman said, 
adding that credit concerns are keeping generators from signing the deals. 
Gov. Davis announced Monday that California has secured 40 long-term 
contracts that will provide California with about 629 million megawatt hours 
of electricity over 10 years, at a price of more than $40 billion. A megawatt 
hour is roughly the amount of electricity needed to power 1,000 homes. 
Several of those forward deals, however, involve contracts originally held by 
Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp. 
(PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric at the California Power Exchange, 
previously the state's main power market. 
The governor seized those contracts earlier this year, just before the Power 
Exchange liquidated them to cover hundreds of millions of dollars in power 
bills the utilities had failed to pay. 
The contracts, which total about 1.3 million megawatt hours of electricity 
and have a market value of about $1 billion, according to market sources, 
have yet to be paid for or signed over to the state. Duke Energy Corp. (DUK), 
one of the suppliers that sold the contracts to Pacific Gas and SoCal Ed, has 
sued Gov. Davis for unlawfully commandeering those contracts. 
Although Duke has reached an interim settlement to continue providing power 
to the state Department of Water Resources until April 30, the company and 
the Davis administration still have to ""develop a comprehensive long-term 
settlement to pay for the power supply contracts,"" said Duke spokesman Tom 
Williams. 
The governor went ahead with the announcement, because the California 
Department of Water Resources believes it will be able to finalize and sign 
the contracts over the next several weeks, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio 
said. 
Separately, several suppliers named in the governor's announcement Monday -- 
including Duke, Reliant Energy Inc. (REI), Mirant Corp. (MIR), Sempra Energy, 
Enron Corp. (ENE) and Avista Corp. (AVA) -- said they have yet to sign final 
agreements with the state, although negotiations were ongoing. 
""We are working in good faith with the DWR toward a long-term contract,"" said 
Art Larson, spokesman for Sempra Energy Resources, a unit of Sempra. Mr. 
Larson said Sempra signed a terms of agreement with the water-resources 
department and expects to reach a final agreement over the next several 
weeks. 
Reliant said it has only signed a short-term contract with the state that 
expires in about two weeks. The company will only sign a long-term contract 
once it's paid more than $400 million owed by Pacific Gas and SoCal Ed, 
spokesman Richard Wheatley said. 
Mirant said it also won't sign contracts with the state until it's paid. 
Enron said it's reached agreement on terms with the state, but has some 
credit-related details to hammer out. ""Everything's been agreed to except for 
some credit technicalities,"" Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. 
Meanwhile, small, independent power plants in California that are capable of 
generating 1,800 megawatts of power are shut down because their owners 
haven't been paid by the state's two main utilities, the California 
Independent System Operator said Tuesday. 
The decline in small-plant output has contributed to the state's power-supply 
problems the past two months. Partnerships involving El Paso Corp. (EPG), for 
example, shut down 350 megawatts of generation last weekend due to 
nonpayment, the company said Tuesday. 
SoCal Ed hasn't paid the owners of the smaller generators, known as 
""qualifying facilities,"" since early December, which means the generators are 
still owed for electric production in October, while PG&E has paid only a 
small percentage of its qualifying facility bills since its last full payment 
in early January. 
The plants, one-third of which are powered by renewable sources like wind and 
solar power, meet almost 30% of California's electricity needs. Almost all of 
the closed generators are fueled by natural gas, and many haven't been able 
to pay their gas suppliers and have been cut off from their gas supply. 
The California Senate Energy Committee plans to vote on legislation to create 
a new pricing system for all qualifying facilities this week. The proposed 
bill would cut the prices to qualifying facilities from about 17 cents a 
kilowatt-hour the past eight months to about eight cents, depending on the 
price of five-year natural-gas contracts the generators can sign. The plants 
that run on renewable resources would be paid 5.4 cents a kilowatt-hour.

US Natural Gas Prices Fall As Demand Slips In Most Areas

03/06/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. natural gas physical prices fell Tuesday as demand 
eased, except in the Northeast and Southeast areas of the country, traders 
said. 
Heavy snowstorms in the upper Northeast supported some pricing, as did cooler 
weather in Georgia, the Carolinas and the Florida panhandle.
Some storage buying occurred in Texas ""if they could make it work,"" a trader 
said. 
""It was a pretty uneventful day,"" a Gulf Coast trader said late Tuesday. 
Also, because of the snowstorm in the Northeast, traders had purchased gas 
ahead of time to make up for needed load, he said. 
A scheduled work outage on Enron's Transwestern San Juan lateral in New 
Mexico was completed, and the return of a power plant in California 
alleviated demand in the West, traders said. 
At the Arizona-California border hub, buyers paid around $13-$33 a million 
British thermal units, West Coast traders said, down as much as $15 from 
Monday. 
At PG&E Citygate, prices were mixed, with buyers paying $9.75-$10.65/MMBtu, 
down 25 cents on the bid, up 15 cents on the offer. 
In the Midwest, Chicago Citygate prices fell 7 cents-8 cents to a range of 
$5.42-$5.53/MMBtu. Alliance Pipeline into Chicago traded around 
$5.47-$5.52/MMBtu, down 4 cents to 9 cents from Monday. 
The Nymex April natural gas futures contract settled at $5.315/MMBtu, down 
2.1 cents in a tight, range-bound, uneventful session that started late due 
to bad weather. 
Physical gas prices at the benchmark Henry Hub in south Louisiana ended in a 
range of $5.25-$5.30/MMBtu, down 2 cents-6 cents from Monday. 
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line at Station 65 deals were made in a similar 
range of $5.26-$5.35/MMBtu, down 2 cents on the bid, unchanged on the offer. 
At Katy in East Texas, buyers paid $5.21-$5.30/MMBtu, down 5 cents-6 cents. 
At Waha, prices fell 9 cents-12 cents to a range of $5.15-$5.30/MMBtu.

","Re: Enron Mentions. It looks like we are playing a smaller role than the WSJ article indicates -- i.e. a role commensurate with our level of interest. I have talked with John several times about the relative importance of OPIC, ExIm and other funding organizations in light of the change in emphasis in our business. As a result of those discussions we cut headcount and expenditures from the proposed budget for ""01 and John has joined Linda Robertson's organization in the DC office (instead of being a stand alone effort). Having said that, my view (based on the work John has been doing) is that we continue to have a considerable amount of work for him to do on the project finance front as a result of existing projects, projects we continue to pursue, and transfer issues associated with the asset sales",1,"Company Business, Strategy, etc."

Vince,
 
Henwood is in the process of developing a new  product that, for lack of a better name, we are calling Market Stack.  The  purpose is to allow traders to utilize the load and supply data in EMSS without  the hassle of a full-blown simulation.  The software would be designed to  allow traders to develop a market (or supply) stack with a minimum number of  keystrokes.  The stacks could be developed for a utility, transarea, or  region, would contain load data, and would be capable of incorporating real-time  information to provide fundamental insight and market advantage.   
 
At this point in the process we are looking for  ideas (and sponsors).  If you think your traders might be open to the idea,  I would like to talk to you and them about it, and potentially as early as next  week.
 
Please advise.

Subject: Barton Bill

You seemed troubled by the call to Barton.  This bill may or may not be 
subsumed by the comprehensive energy bill that Congress undertakes this 
summer.  Both bills have a very difficult, if not nearly impossible, path 
ahead given that the Democrats are in no mood for compromise.  The call to 
Barton was to:  a) repair relationships (and with the Wall Street Journal 
calling Barton about his troubled past with Enron, repair is needed); b) 
proclaim victory, even of a limited nature (something I think Enron has not 
done much of); c) build a further bond with Barton so we would have more 
input at full Committee (something we will need given the chances that this 
will go off the track are real); and d) allow Enron to get significant credit 
for the defeat of price caps.  I hear from lots of DC sources that we have 
not had any success in the House Energy and Commerce Committee.  Numerous 
folks at the markup noted in private conversations that this was Enron's 
first real role in the Committee.  Thus, even though this is a very limited 
bill, the call made sense.  I do not think that this means we should call the 
White House to push the bill with them.  The bill itself still has lots of 
obstacles and many potential threats ahead.

Mr. Shapiro has updated his presentation.  Can you make sure that this

presentation be saved on a computer for his use or does he need to have it on

Subject: Stella Chan /Project Summer transfers

Steve/ Cindy

Just want to state a case for this move, (before everyone starts up on the 
movement moratorium issues surronding the "" EI"" companies -which I understand 
is still in place).

Stella Chan (Director level) is one of 6 expats Apachi have seconded into our 
SK Enron JV in Korea. Because they all mobilized at the same time, Darrell 
Kinder and I put in place a rotation plan whereby some would leave early, 
some extend (so we didnt have everyone leaving the JV at the same time). Its 
worked well to date, and we've mamanged to keep the Partners happy with the 
moves/replacements.

Bottom line with respect to the Project Summer moratorium (in my view) is 
that because Stella will be replaced she is no longer part of the 
'intellectual capital' the buyer (or any future buyer) is seeking to retain, 
and so the move should go ahead.

Hope you concur.

Darrell,

Stella Chan's contract will conclude March 1 2001. She had shown some desire 
to repatriate early and under the repatriation agreement I allowed her to 
start her search (six months prior). Stella's search was very quick and she 
has landed a job with the Corporate Public Affairs group under Harry 
Kingerski, who works for Rick Shapiro, who works for Steve Kean. She has set 
a preliminary job switch for October 16, 2000.

This does not cause me too much concern, for as you are aware Waymon Votaw 
who works in the Southern Cone group under John Guidry has shown a desire to 
be Stella's replacement. The timing of this could work out real well. Please 
pass this to the powers to be for approval so I may move forward with the 
next step with both individuals.

Thanks


Tony

We're in the process of developing a strategy to take us through the next few 
months.  But while the (otherwise perishable) thoughts are still fresh in my 
mind from the hearings on Monday and Tuesday, I wanted to throw out some 
observations for discussion in the days/weeks ahead.

OBSERVATION--The pressure to finger somebody for ""price gouging"" is 
increasing.

The administration is hell bent on finding a ""fall guy.""  The price spikes 
pose real political risks for Davis and he and his folks need and want an 
easy way out.   His press release following the hearing renewed the call for 
""refunds.""  On my panel, Loretta Lynch asked Reliant and Duke to supply her 
with the details of the contracts they cut to sell their power forward to 
marketers.  And Carl Wood's remarks were extreme.
At the Barton hearing, a liberal democrat (Filner) and a conservative 
Republican (Hunter) locked arms in calling for refunds. Bilbray joined the 
""gouging"" band wagon.
The utilities repeatedly called on FERC to do a ""real"" investigation, with 
hearings, testimony, data discovery---the works. 
On the positive side, the FERC commissioners lauded Wolak, his analysis, and 
his remarks on the panel.  Wolak said somewhat emphatically that the nature 
of California's market structure makes it impossible to single out a single 
participant as the culprit.  He also stated that just everyone's just acting 
in their own self-interest, responding to the screwed incentives embedded in 
the structure.

IMPLICATION--It seems prudent for Enron to understand better its risks of 
getting fingered.

In the best case, the clamoring for a ""refund"" subsides.  In which case, the 
only cost to Enron is the internal cost incurred to understand better the 
risks of getting fingered.
In the medium case, investigations find that Enron (like others) ""played by 
the rules,"" but the rules stunk, and Enron profited at the expense of 
California consumers.  ","Observations on the Hearings this Week. We're in the process of developing a strategy to take us through the next few months.

Subject:=09Transatlantic meetings

To the Executive Committee:

Attached is a note that has been sent to our managers regarding off-site an=
d team-building meetings.  My impression is that our commendable efforts to=
 build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many get-togethers that=
 require substantial travel.  Our challenge is that such gatherings are far=
 more costly and time-consuming for us to attend than our Houston colleague=
s might realize.  Often, participating in these meetings takes an entire we=
ek for Enron Europe employees (especially if they are outside of Texas). Na=
turally, they may feel that this time of year (PRC time) is exactly the wro=
ng time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering.

These off-sites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter, which comp=
ounds the difficulty; worse still are the times they occur at the end of Q2=
, since it also coincides and conflicts with the PRC process.

I would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the tra=
vel time and costs (both direct and indirect) when inviting international e=
mployees to off-site meetings in the US.  We appreciate the chance to be in=
cluded in the broader Enron initiatives and to share ideas across organizat=
ions, but we are really trying to reinforce the message about managing expe=
nses.

Thanks!

John Sherriff


(Letter sent to all Enron Europe VPs and direct reports)

We still have issues regarding Offsites and 'Team Building' exercises.  In =
particular, we have recently had examples of departments failing to inform =
other key work groups when workplace absences are pending.

In order to avoid misunderstandings, and to increase transparency, the foll=
owing will apply with immediate effect:

Any Offsite or 'Team Building' exercise which any group (both commercial an=
d non-commercial, and including John and myself)intends to undertake must b=
e communicated, in advance, to all department heads. Issue to be identified=
 include:  all participants who will out of the office, total costs of the =
exercise; and, where appropriate, work load coverage details.

John and I are very supportive of team building exercises but we much prefe=
r that they be conducted in the evenings or at weekends. To the extent that=
 is not possible, we must absolutely avoid quarter ends and ensure all work=
 is appropriately covered.

Trips to Houston and especially resorts in the US are far more difficult to=
 justify based on the substantial travel time and costs involved.  So pleas=
e pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel.

Please communicate this policy to your staff.

Michael Brown

PRC reviews with the Analysts and Associates should be completed by early August, and the signed evaluation forms should be returned to me at EB3539b.  The Program recommends that if asked, the supervisor should provide the actual ranking to the Analyst or Associate.  In addition, we recommend that the PRC representative be involved in providing feedback to the Analyst or Associate.

Steve,

I am a lead recruiter at the University of California at Berkeley for
Enron Analyst/Associate program.

I contacted several friends who work at Berkeley and received an invitation
from one of them to make a presentation at the weekly Faculty Seminar
of the Dept. of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research.

The students and faculty members from the business school will be also 
invited.

Berkeley in general, and Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Research in
particular, are important centers of academic research on electricity markets
(S. Oren works very closely with Severin Borenstein).

My presentation will focus on the Analyst/Associate program. I shall  also 
have
an opportunity to discuss the power markets in California (I expect many
questions) before many experts who are very  important to shaping
public opinion and regulatory agenda.

Please, let me know who in you group could help me in preparing this 
presentation
and in presenting  Enron's point of view in a more effective way.

Andy -

Thanks again for allowing me to participate in this afternoon's discussion.
As I mentioned, I believe discussions of transmission issues must include
both jurisdictional and RTO.  I understand that the RTO discussion is more
difficult in the absence of paper.  For that reason, I have taken the
liberty of drafting language that I believe mirrors (at least my view) of
one possible construct of RTO Proposal I.

I hope you find this helpful.  I will bring copies to our meeting tomorrow.

Let's talk.  While there is always some value in these things it is ususally 
quite small and consumes more valuable resources in trying to capture the 
benefit than the benefit itself.

Subject: A&M - Bush Library Foundation & School of Public Policy

Steve-

We have been approached by the Texas A&M/George Bush Presidential Library 
Foundation and School of Public Policy to endow additional funds.

Enron had made an original contribution to the library foundation back in 
1998 totaling $250K over five years.

I am working with Community Relations and A/A Recruiting to evaluate the 
latest request and to discuss where Enron may have interest or find leverage 
for our Government Affairs, Recruiting, or PR efforts.

The Foundation is willing to work with us to establish whatever type of 
program(s) and/or participatory involvement we would like.  We have discussed 
an Enron speaker series, classroom lectures, advisory committee seats and the 
likes.

I have already had a chance to run this by Rick Shapiro and Rob Bradley.  
Although Rick was noncommittal regarding his team's time for speaking or 
lecturing, he seemed supportive of the effort.  Rob has already been 
participating in some speaking opportunities there, and supported expanded 
efforts.

What are your thoughts on contribution levels (another $250K was suggested by 
CR) and any specific program or relationship opportunities regarding the 
Library Center or School of Public Policy.

Please grab me for quick conversation when you have time.

Thanks.

Mike

I think it's a good document and carves out some solid policy ground for 
Bush.  I think the electricity section needs some additions though.  There is 
not a lot that the current administration can do about siting new plants and 
power lines -- its largely a state and local decision.  Further, the problem 
has been less about government failing to provide adequate incentives to 
utilities than it has been about a failure of the current commission to 
opening the grid on a nondiscriminatory basis.  Once utilities are in the 
open access transmission business they will look for ways to invest in the 
grid and stop getting in the way of independent power producers who want to 
connect to the grid.  The answer is open access, so power can get from where 
it is to where it is needed.  This has been clear for a long time, yet the 
current administration (and its appointees on FERC) have yet to use their 
authority to make this happen.  The result: spiking prices and reliability 
problems.

Here's the list of recommendations from the report.

(1) The PX =01&must-buy=018 requirement would become a =01&must-schedule=01=

be free of
refund obligations) only if they offer a substantial portion of their sales=

in the form of
two-year contracts at rates that approximate competitive prices. The detail=

of such a
proposal are outlined in this report. The volume offered by sellers, in the=

(3) Any market participant that does not offer these two-year=20

I know we are holding for a later filing, but I have attached further comments anyway.  The document is still too rough to send out.  We need to take the opportunity, as soon as possible, to get a hard hitting, thoroughly researched and carefully written document in front of the Commissioners.  California's reaction to the Judge's recommendation is likely to give FERC (especially the new commissioners) a feel for how irrational the California politicians can be.  We will have a limited opportunity to take advantage of that realization.  We need to hit it hard in the pleading, our conversations at the Commission, the Hill and the media.

At the right time, it would be helpful to discuss what we may want to consider as ""Core"" Assets (unrelated to trading activities) for purposes of emerging from bankruptcy as a going concern.  As you know, we are in the process of organizing and formatting in an asset matrix the assets/businesses we currently own (or otherwise have an interest in) that may be potentially for sale; separating out potential core assets will be instructive as part of this process.

Please let me know your thoughts/suggestions over the next few weeks.

Having worked on the Enron Advisory council process, I have one observation:  
consider having some or all of these individuals as ""guest speakers"" rather 
than formal memebers.  You can still have them review information, do their 
homework, and tailor their remarks to Enron specifics.
Also, you should definitely include Paul Portney at Resources for the 
Future.  He sits on the Enron Advisory Council and knows the company well.

		 Subject: External Advisory Council

As we discussed at the last Corporate Responsibility task force meeting, one 
activity that we have underway is recruiting an external advisory council.  
This council will be comprised of global experts on environmental and social 
issues, from non-governmental organizations and potentially other businesses, 
to advise us on trends and issues in this area.  An outline of the advisory 
council structure, along with categories of experts and proposed names is 
attached below.

We expect to convene meetings with this group twice a year, inviting the 
Enron executive committee and board of directors, as well as the Corporate 
Responsibility task force, to engage in a dialogue.  We plan to present a 
slate of possible candidates to Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling later this month, 
and would appreciate your input and any ideas by March 16.

Thanks for your consideration.

I'll wait to hear from David/Ted tomorrow morning as to whether I should provide a complete draft to any of these other functions or to Rick Buy at this point, or if I should wait until later in the week when we've all had the opportunity to review.  

As I turn around the next draft, I'll work on a power point presentation for use in the executive meetings beginning the last week of June (Business Unit Offices of the Chairman, Whalley, Causey, Fastow, Skilling).

 Electricity Crisis Cools Down a Bit in San Diego County, Calif. Dan McSwain 
? 09/26/2000 KRTBN Knight-Ridder Tribune Business News: North County Times - 
Escondido, California Copyright (C) 2000 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business 
News; Source: World Reporter (TM) 

An uneasy aftermath has settled over this summer's power price shocks in San 
Diego County, punctuated this weekend by cool weather and falling electricity 
prices, as the state and federal policy-making apparatus shifts from a season 
of panicked damage control to the extremely difficult question of what to do 
next.

In the parlance of the electricity industry, these are the ""shoulder"" months; 
a breather between periods of heavy demand for summer cooling and winter 
heating in which power-generating plants are typically pulled out of 
commission for trouble-shooting, overdue maintenance and refueling. 

California's pioneering deregulation of its electricity industry lies in a 
state of exhaustion. Guarantees from politicians of greater efficiency and 
lower prices have collapsed this summer into chronic power shortages and a 
historic transfer of wealth that in about 90 days moved $10.6 billion from 
the buyers of electricity to the sellers.

Optimism is in short supply as a fractious collection of stakeholders and the 
nation's political and regulatory institutions begin to search for solutions.

Emergency legislation approved by state lawmakers in August will temporarily 
reduce bills for the 1.2 million customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Co. 
from an average $146 in September to about $72 per month. In July 1999, San 
Diego County and parts of south Orange County became the first region in the 
nation under deregulation law to directly pay the wholesale price of 
electricity.

Cool weather has caused demand for power to sag this weekend, bringing prices 
down from their lofty summer peaks to about 7.5 cents per kilowatt hour on 
Friday.

But while the legislation has capped rates at 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour for 
SDGOcustomers, the utility will continue to pay the volatile wholesale cost 
of power, which averaged 21.4 cents this month. Historically, prices have 
fallen to as low as 1 cent per kilowatt in the winter months, but this year 
prices seem likely to exceed 6.5 cents for most of the year, and take off 
again in summer 2001.

Analysts say generating and power marketing companies will retain their 
ability to raise prices, called market power, because their costs are higher 
and supplies of power are tight in the Pacific Northwest.

SDGOsays the legislation could create a shortfall, to be financed by the 
company, that could run up an $800 million IOU by 2003. In the past, the 
Public Utilities Commission has allowed the utility to pass on such 
shortfalls to consumers in the form of higher rates.

Pacific Gas&Electric and Southern California Edison, the state's other 
investor-owned utilities, have collectively lost at least $3.3 billion this 
summer because their retail rates have remain capped under deregulation. Both 
utilities are seeking to end their retail rate caps early to escape the risk 
of sustained high wholesale prices.

Consumer groups are outraged; investors are skeptical. Three major credit 
rating companies said the California utilities face increased regulatory 
uncertainty, and the utilities' stock prices fell last week.

A hot-potato mentality is emerging among policy-makers who say the authority 
to clamp down on market behavior has been dispersed by deregulation.

California regulators and consumer advocates have great expectations for a 
series of state and federal investigations into the causes of higher prices 
and into charges of market manipulation and price gouging by power companies. 
Chief among them is an investigation by the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission that may lead to changes in California's power trading system.

""Unfortunately, we have ceded most of our authority over wholesale markets to 
the federal government,"" said Loretta Lynch, the president of the California 
Public Utilities Commission, the state's top regulator.

James Hoecker, the chairman of the federal commission, said Lynch overstates 
the case. ""California has not given me one scintilla of authority that I 
didn't already have,"" Hoecker said in August.

The federal commission has been critical of California's approach to 
deregulation, but has been reluctant to intervene in interstate wholesale 
markets, into state trading systems, or to make aggressive use of its 
investigative powers.

What is dawning on California policy-makers, analysts say, is the hard lesson 
that deregulation transfers considerable authority away from government 
officials and to the market participants. The challenge is to get 
deregulation right the first time.

""The problem is not deregulation,"" said Robert McCullough, an economist and 
former utility executive based in Portland, Ore. ""The problem is this Rube 
Goldberg device that has been constructed in California.""

The trading practices of power marketers in the West also is under scrutiny 
by the federal commission. Regulators informed electricity marketing 
companies in August that if price gouging is found, the refund of some 
profits may be ordered by the commission for windfall profits that are earned 
after mid-October.

A surprising number of observers say generators have simply acted in their 
own interest and taken advantage of the rules to make money. Ranging from 
consumer advocates to economists to some regulators themselves, many say 
bungled deregulation is a more likely cause of high prices than a conspiracy 
of generating companies.

""This market has behaved very rationally this summer,"" said Frank Wolak, a 
Stanford economist who chairs the market surveillance committee of 
California's power transmission manager. ""All you need is tight supply to 
exercise market power in this market; you don't need collusion.""

A titanic shift is shaping up in the way power is bought on the wholesale 
markets on behalf of California consumers. All three utilities have been 
granted authority by state regulators to make confidential deals for 
electricity directly with individual generators or power trading companies, 
largely bypassing the state's nonprofit power exchange.

In an equally important development, the manager of most of California's 
transmission system has asked federal regulators for permission to sign 
long-term deals for power. Up to now, the transmission manager has been 
limited to last-minute purchases of emergency power to stabilize the grid.

Critics fear both measures are steps toward reinstating the system that 
existed before deregulation, in which a small number of buyers made large, 
long-term deals with a handful of suppliers.

The architects of California's deregulation, fearing the monopoly power of 
the utilities, had stripped bilateral purchasing authority to foster 
competition among a new kind of retail power provider. Under the scheme, 
utilities were to be limited to the highly regulated business of electricity

Just checking to see if there is any new word from IEP on the draft Feinstein legislation you had sent earlier.  I have quietly alerted others in town -- such as EPSA and INGAA.  NGSA -- the group that represents the natural gas producers -- is aware and sending comments to her this week.  We have heard conflicting reports about whether she still intends to pursue the legislation -- at least on a stand alone basis -- and how much of a priority should will place on it in relation to other energy issues.  I intend to call her energy staffer next week to sit down before the Senate Energy Committee resumes votes in September.  Any news on this issue would be helpful.  Thanks in advance.

I assume you're all over this, Linda.

On the off chance that you haven't seen it.  Feinstein is asking IEP for comments on her draft legislation that would increase regulation of natural gas, define what just and reasonable rates would be and increase refund power on the electric side.  I think we would have some concerns with her proposal.  If you want to pass along our comments to IEP, just get them to me.","FW: Feinstein Legislation.

I intend to call her energy staffer next week to sit down before the Senate Energy Committee resumes votes in September. Any news on this issue would be helpful.

coule you get Jeannie copies of the slides or other write ups you have on 
this.

Jeannie -- I don't know how far it is prudent to take a position on this as a 
co.  It has already become a key battleground (garnering some discussion in 
the Gore-Lieberman debate).  I think we stay away from it as a co., but we at 
least ought to put the information in front of anyone we are asking to do an 
oped so that they can make a reasoned judgement.

Hi -- I'm working on a dual gas/power op-ed (the former DeLay op-ed). I have 
Enron's message points on higher gas prices, but I wondered if we were taking 
a position on expanding natural gas exploration as Gov. Bush proposes -- onto 
more federal lands, particularly in Alaska. I read somewhere that 40% of 
potential US reserves are on federal lands.

Thanks for your help,

Feedback from two exit interviews from voluntary terminations in regard to Tom is as follows:
""was treated as inferior by my manager""
""was lied to and insulted by my supervisor""
Tom ""berates employees in front of others and blames underlings for his mistakes.  Additionally, he second guessed every position I put on, sold me out of positions (which turned out good) and used all our allocated VAR for his own benefit.""
Tom ""has a reputation for not representing employees well in the end of year review process.  I found this to be the case as well.""
""Tom is difficult to communicate with""

Additionally, we had an incident w/ an employee when Tom offered her an employment agreement. 
She felt that she was being forced to sign the agreement
When she declined the agreement and turned in resignation, she said that Tom said he would make it difficult for her to leave
She said that she felt threatened by Tom
Her boy friend called Tom and threatened him

Restructuring Today quotes Jeff at length on retail vs wholesale price caps.  
He does talk about protecting small customers with retail caps and highlights 
the more destructive nature of wholesale caps.  If you need a copy let me 
know.

Thanks, Steve.  The message we received was that Jeff had said he'd take
retail price caps to avoid wholesale price caps.  I know the press and
listeners will distort things, so I take the reports with a grain of salt.
We just hope that you and Dasovich will find a way, if asked, to stress the
right way to take care of small customers - enhance competition and create
a robust retail market.

I know we all want the same result.  We just hope that with our roadshow
beginning next week, Gene doesn't have to explain away any other perceived
Enron slams on retail competition.

P. S.  I can't think of two better spokesmen for the cause of competition
than you and Dasovich.

Ironically, the sale of those bonds won't be hurt by the S&P downgrade=20

""What's important for the bonds is how the (utility) rates are structured t=

Energy price gouging might end up felony

Democratic lawmakers this week will unveil a proposal to make energy price=

gouging a felony -- punishable by stiff fines and possible jail time -- tha=
t=20
could be subject to the state's controversial ""three strikes"" law.=20
The measure, sponsored by Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, would punish companies=

that sell electricity or natural gas in California at ""unjust or unreasonab=
le=20
rates.""=20
""There is a tremendous amount of wealth that is being transferred from=20
California to five companies, mostly in Texas,"" Bustamante said. ""If what=

they're doing isn't illegal, it ought to be.""=20
Though lawmakers are expected to introduce the measure Thursday, it already=

author, Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza, D-Merced.=20
According to a draft version of the bill and some proposed amendments, a=20
corporation, or a person with decision-making authority at the corporation,=
=20
would be found guilty of a felony if ""they collude or conspire to manipulat=
e=20

A state or federal regulatory agency -- such as the Federal Energy Regulato=

that happened, the bill would open the door for prosecution by the state=20
attorney general or local district attorneys.=20
In addition, if found guilty, companies would be forced to pay restitution=

Though the provision was in an early draft of the bill, Cardoza said it's=

""While I think this crime is every bit as abhorrent as going in and stealin=
g=20
money from a bank, we're going to have to figure out a little bit different=

Even without the three strikes provision, the bill raises certain=20

Dan Walters: It's time for politicians to be honest about the energy crisis


(Published April 25, 2001)=20
Gov. Gray Davis is continuing to tell Californians that he's on top of the=
=20
state's energy crisis and, as he said at one gathering last week, ""in three=
=20
years, this problem will be a distant memory."" Fat chance. All major aspect=
s=20
of the situation are growing worse, not better, minute by minute.=20
Politicians took over the crisis in January as the state's major utilities=
=20
exhausted their cash reserves and lines of credit. Davis began what he said=
=20
then would be a short-term emergency program of power purchases to keep=20
electrons flowing into homes and businesses.=20
From that moment forward, the situation has steadily deteriorated, moving=
=20
toward a three-pronged disaster: severe summer blackouts, the bankruptcy of=
=20
the utilities and sharply escalating power bills. With the bankruptcy filin=
g=20
by Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and decisions by Davis and the state Public=
=20
Utilities Commission to begin ratcheting up utility rates, two of the three=
=20
negative scenarios are now in place. And everyone involved in the crisis=20
expects blackouts this summer as demands for power soar and supplies dwindl=
e.=20
The Davis strategy, if there is one, is to continue the state's massive pow=
er=20
purchases while negotiating longer-term and presumably cheaper supply=20
contracts, encourage conservation, help utilities pay off their debts by=20
selling their intercity transmission system to the state and tapping=20
ratepayers, and build more power plants to ease the supply crunch.=20
Currently, the governor is touting his deal with Edison International, pare=
nt=20
company of Southern California Edison, to sell its portion of the power gri=
d=20
and is working on a similar deal with Sempra, the parent of San Diego Gas &=
=20
and Electric. But PG&E's bankruptcy filing casts doubt on the viability of=
=20
the cash-for-grid concept, and legislators, particularly Davis' fellow=20
Democrats, are very skeptical of the Edison deal.=20
Clearly, Davis rushed into the Edison deal just three days after PG&E made=
=20
its bankruptcy filing, in hopes of erasing the political stain of the latte=
r=20
action, but its provisions are being labeled a bailout by critics. It place=
s=20
only a token financial burden on Edison International while guaranteeing th=
e=20
profitability of its utility subsidiary by charging its customers whatever =
is=20
required to cover its costs and past debts.=20
Meanwhile, the state is spending -- by Davis' own account -- about $70=20
million a day or $2 billion-plus a month on spot power purchases, paying=20
roughly five times what consumers are being charged at the retail level. An=
d=20
the futures market for power indicates that wholesale power prices will jum=
p=20
50 percent by midsummer; higher prices and greater purchases could increase=
=20
the drain on the state treasury to as much as $5 billion a month.=20
State Treasurer Phil Angelides is desperately trying to arrange a bridge lo=
an=20
to relieve pressure on the state's rapidly vanishing reserves, but Wall=20
Street is reluctant to lend without a fuller explanation of what's happenin=
g=20
and a specific authorization from a suspicious Legislature. Meanwhile,=20
bankers are sending strong signals that the state government is becoming as=
=20
poor a lending risk as the utilities.=20
Davis, for some reason, is unwilling to declare this situation the emergenc=
y=20
that it is truly becoming -- one that could take a toll on human life if=20
major blackouts shut down air conditioners, respirators and traffic lights.=
=20
He insists on issuing his periodic -- and wholly unrealistic -- assurances=
=20
that things will turn out all right, even declaring to reporters on Tuesday=
,=20
""We think we'll have this thing licked by the end of fall.""=20
It's time for someone -- the governor, preferably, but someone -- to lay ou=

for Californians exactly what's happening, the downside financial and power=
=20
supply risks, and what's being done to deal with the looming disaster facin=

Bond-rating agency delivers reprimand, downgrade=20

Standard & Poor's said that if the sale of a state revenue bond is delayed,=
=20
the potential impact on the state general fund could be ""severe"" without a=
=20
rate hike much larger than the increase of more than 40 percent approved by=
=20
the state Public Utilities Commission last month.=20
""Rate increases appear difficult in the present political environment, and=
=20
related voter initiatives, although none are currently on the ballot, remai=
n=20
a possibility,"" said Standard & Poor's.=20
The state began buying power after the two largest utilities, Pacific Gas a=
nd=20
Electric and Southern California Edison, were nearly bankrupt. The rates th=
ey=20
could charge customers were frozen under deregulation as the cost of=20
wholesale power soared, producing a debt of $13 billion.=20
Standard & Poor's said the state expected in January to spend less than $1=
=20
billion and resolve the problem in a few months with long-term power=20
contracts at lower prices. But most of the contracts do not begin until thi=
s=20
fall or later.=20
""In addition,"" said Standard & Poor's, ""it is not unreasonable to expect pa=
st=20
and future blackouts to affect business location decisions, and hence the=
=20
ultimate direction of the state's economy.""=20
A spokesman for the governor said that Standard & Poor's view of how the=20
California economy will fare during the electricity crisis is far too dim.=
=20
""California's economy is still fundamentally strong,"" said spokesman Roger=
=20
Salazar. ""We expect that in 2001 we will continue to lead the nation in=20
economic growth and job creation.""=20
Another Wall Street credit-rating firm, Moody's, has a more positive view o=
f=20
how the governor and the Legislature have handled the crisis and expects th=
e=20
state general fund to be repaid by the ratepayer bond.=20
""We are still at our AA2 with a negative outlook,"" said Ray Murphy, Moody's=
=20
vice president. ""Nothing that we have learned over the last week or so has=
=20
led us to change that opinion.""=20
Angelides said legislation is needed because PG&E and Edison are challengin=
g=20
a PUC action last month that gives the state some revenue from monthly=20
ratepayer bills, which is needed to finance the bond to repay the state=20
general fund.=20
The utilities say they need more of the ratepayer revenue.=20
The treasurer said the legislation would bypass the lengthy PUC process and=
=20
authorize the state to issue a ratepayer bond of $10 billion or more. The=
=20
governor said again yesterday that he believes a bond of $12.4 billion will=
=20
cover state power costs this year.=20
Angelides said legislation is urgent because a commitment from three lender=
s=20
to give the state a $4.1 billion short-term loan expires May 8.=20
He said the short-term bridge loan would ease the strain on the state gener=

?????The consequences of a downgrade are profound, Angelides said, noting=

that it took California years to overcome the downgrades spurred by the=20
recession of the early 1990s.
?????""It is critical that the Legislature act immediately to clearly=20

Price Controls Spark Deja Vu=20

Energy: The specter of Richard Nixon's actions 30 years ago hangs over=20
current debate on how to check the state's surging power costs.=20

By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer=20

?????A debate now rages in California over whether price controls should be=
=20
adopted to stem the state's soaring power costs and help consumers who are=
=20
bracing for huge spikes in their electric bills.
?????But price controls are one of the most controversial actions in=20
economics--and in politics, for that matter. And now the caps are more in=
=20
dispute than ever because they run counter to the nation's move over the la=
st=20
two decades to deregulate more and more industries, from airlines to=20
railroads to energy.
?????Yet California is a good example of deregulation gone haywire, so=20
controls are again being demanded by lawmakers, consumer advocates and othe=
rs=20
as a way to check surging prices. On the other side is a chorus of critics=
=20
who ridicule price caps as being ineffective and, at times, making matters=
=20
worse for consumers.
?????Case in point: the Golden State itself, which tried last summer to use=
=20
temporary price caps to keep a lid on skyrocketing wholesale electricity=20
prices.
?????Critics claim that the caps drove power sales out of state, thus=20
widening the imbalance between supply and demand, reinforcing the existing=
=20
shortages and contributing to this winter's rolling blackouts.
?????But defenders of the caps note that the dysfunctional California marke=
t=20
had no way to self-correct. The utilities couldn't simply refuse to buy=20
electricity in the face of higher prices, and with no price ceiling in sigh=
t,=20
something had to be done.
?????And now Gov. Gray Davis and others are again calling for temporary=20
controls until more electricity supplies can be added, especially as the=20
state enters the peak-power summer season. On Tuesday, Sens. Dianne Feinste=
in=20
(D-Calif.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) introduced legislation that would impo=
se=20
price controls on wholesale energy throughout 11 Western states.
?????Mindful of the controversial history of controls, Feinstein and Smith=
=20
stressed that the caps would last only through March 1, 2003. But they also=
=20
argued that the economic damage to industries and consumers from escalating=
=20
power costs would exceed any harm caused by price controls.
?????""I have a strong preference for markets, but it's a mistake to believe=
=20
that we have a free market when it comes to energy,"" said Smith, the only G=
OP=20
co-sponsor of the legislation.
?????Their bill would require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, whi=
ch=20
regulates U.S. wholesale electricity prices, either to impose a regional=20
price cap or institute a rate schedule for each power generator, tying the=
=20
price of electricity to the cost of producing it.
?????Coincidentally, FERC today is expected to decide on various other=20
proposals to again limit California's power costs--but without explicitly=
=20
stating that the plans include price controls. Why? Because the Bush=20
administration and FERC Chairman Curt Hebert Jr., among others, are on the=
=20
record as adamantly opposing price caps.
?????That's not surprising. Price controls often are tagged as a liberal=20
maneuver that flies in the face of conservatives' free-market ideology. Yet=
,=20
ironically, hanging over the California debate is the legacy of a Republica=
n=20
president who was the last one to mandate price controls on a nationwide=20
level: Richard M. Nixon.
?????The late president took that rare step 30 years ago this August to try=
=20
to quell inflation and spark an economic rebound. His actions were so=20
dramatic that they are still invoked by those wanting to criticize or, in=
=20
some cases, endorse setting limits on prices.
?????""What he did is almost larger than life now,"" said Shannon Burchett,=
=20
chief executive of RiskLimited Corp., a strategic consulting firm in Dallas=
.
?????Nixon's controls were the most far-reaching since World War II, when=
=20
prices were capped so that profiteers couldn't reap huge sums for scarce=20
commodities being used for the war and simultaneously rationed at home.
?????In most cases, price controls have been much less sweeping and targete=
d=20
at specific products or services. They don't always involve changing the la=
w,=20
either. In 1962, President Kennedy publicly rebuked the then-U.S. Steel Cor=
p.=20
and its chairman, Roger Blough, for starting an industrywide move to raise=
=20
steel prices. The price hikes were rolled back a few days later.
?????Since Nixon, price controls have become rarer as industries that were=
=20
once regulated--which means their prices were government-controlled--have=
=20
been deregulated.
?????So it is in California, where electric utilities' prices were controll=
ed=20
for decades until the state's deregulation law in 1996. But now that the la=
w=20
has been blamed for the soaring wholesale prices, power shortages, crippled=
=20
utilities and the need for a huge jump in ratepayers' costs, some again wan=
t=20
price controls on electricity until the crisis eases.
?????Which brings everyone back to Nixon.

?????Some Nixon Controls Were Lifted by Reagan
?????""I've heard people make the analogy to what happened . . . when Nixon=
=20
put on controls,"" but in California ""this is fundamentally different,"" said=
=20
Mike Florio, a board member of the California Independent System Operator,=
=20
which oversees most of the state's electricity grid.
?????""When you get into a situation of shortage [of supplies], there is=20
really no restraint at all on prices,"" said Florio, who said he normally=20
prefers unfettered markets but also defended the state's caps last summer.=
=20
Such government intervention ""on a temporary basis is better than nothing,=
=20
but I don't think it's ideal.""
?????The reverberations from Nixon's fiat aren't just felt in California=20
either. When New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani recently proposed more stringe=
nt=20
controls on wholesale electricity costs in New York state, critics promptly=
=20
pointed to Nixon's controls. ""They were a disaster,"" one columnist wrote.
?????Even Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who was in the private=
=20
sector in the early 1970s, turned down several requests to take high-level=
=20
White House jobs in part because he was disgusted with Nixon's price contro=
ls.
?????Many economists and historians also judge Nixon's controls as a mistak=
e.=20
But some maintain that his decision--which began with a 90-day freeze on=20
prices, wages and rents--wasn't entirely a failure and even provided ""shock=
=20
value"" that, for a while at least, arrested higher inflation.
?????In addition, part of Nixon's move involved taking the dollar off the=
=20
gold standard--which in effect meant its price was controlled--and letting =
it=20
float in value against other major currencies. And that, many believe, is t=
he=20
base upon which today's global financial markets operate.
?????Others disagree.
?????""There really isn't an example of where they've [price controls]=20
worked,"" said Robert Goldberg, a senior fellow at the National Center for=
=20
Policy Analysis, a nonpartisan think tank in New York.
?????""Controls always lead to an underproduction"" of the commodity involved=
=20
because producers don't have any incentive to spend more on additional=20
output, he said. When the caps ultimately are lifted, prices typically soar=
=20
anyway as producers move to quickly recoup the profit they lost when the=20
controls were in place, Goldberg added.
?????Others note that although most of Nixon's price controls lasted only a=
=20
couple of years, various forms of controls over crude oil and natural gas=
=20
lasted for another decade until they were removed by President Ronald Reaga=
n.
?????In the meantime, the controls--aggravated by embargoes and other suppl=
y=20
cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries--distorted the fr=
ee=20
market for energy, critics say. The controls kept U.S. oil prices=20
artificially low, which in turn kept demand for oil high, giving OPEC more=
=20
power over world production and prices in the 1970s, they contend.
?????Nonetheless, proponents keep calling for controls when prices for=20
certain items seem to be spiraling out of control.

?????Critics Say Controls Worsen the Problems
?????President Clinton's massive health-reform proposal in the early 1990s=
=20
included price controls on drugs. But the idea set off howls of protest fro=
m=20
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, and ultimately the entire=
=20
proposal was shelved. Consumer advocates and others also demanded federal=
=20
controls on rising cable TV rates in 1997 and 1998, again contending that t=
he=20
cable operators were hiking prices at a much faster rate than inflation.=20
Cable firms were allowed to keep passing certain costs on to their=20
subscribers, but specific price caps weren't enacted.
?????But proponents of temporary price controls on California power emphasi=
ze=20
that electricity isn't in the same category as an airplane seat, steel or=
=20
other commodities that don't have to be bought if the price soars too high.
?????""In soybeans maybe the market can adjust quickly"" to changes in supply=
=20
and demand, ""but in electric generation in California it can't,"" said Flori=
o,=20
who also serves as an attorney for the Utility Reform Network, a consumer=
=20
group. ""For most products, one of the ways prices get determined is if buye=
rs=20
refuse to buy when the price gets too high. But that's generally not an=20
option for people when it comes to electricity.""
?????Critics of California's attempt to cap prices last summer said the=20
controls instead prompted many power suppliers to sell their electricity to=
=20
other states. That ""actually made the tight-supply problem worse [in=20
California] by driving imports out of the state,"" the Bay Area Economic=20
Forum, a research group funded by regional business and government agencies=
,=20
said in a report last week.
?????Indeed, the temporary caps were basically abandoned by year's end to=
=20
keep enough electricity in the state.
?????Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economics professor who heads the=
=20
Independent System Operator's market surveillance committee, said there are=
=20
ways to mitigate the state's power prices without having to set rigid=20
controls. One proposal: Have FERC require that generators supply 75% of the=
ir=20
expected future sales to California under long-term contracts at ""just and=
=20
reasonable"" prices set by the federal agency, he said.
?????That would ""send the right [price] signal to suppliers to come into th=
e=20
state,"" Wolak said.
?????And because it will take time for California to get more of its own=20
power-generating plants up and running, the state's electricity crisis isn'=
t=20
unlike a natural disaster in which ""normal public service is disrupted"" and=
=20
short-term controls serve a purpose, Florio said.

Power Plant Emits Tons of Fumes=20

Round-the-clock operation of old generators in Glendale and elsewhere=20
produces more than twice the old limits of pollution.=20

By JEAN GUCCIONE, Times Staff Writer=20

?????For the past five weeks, Glendale's Grayson power plant has been=20
belching a half-ton of pollutants into the air almost daily, more than twic=

previous limits.
?????The same is true for many of the other 14 power plants in Southern=20

e=20
""have-nots.""
?????The generators, some of them nearly 50 years old and once considered t=
oo=20
dirty for regular use, now keep electricity flowing to fellow residents=20
around the state. And those living downwind are subjected to twice as much=

air pollution as before California's energy crunch.
?????Not every Glendale resident is happy.
?????""You don't want anyone to get stuck with a rolling blackout, but we ge=

decision.""
?????Not so for Ignacio Troncoso, director of Glendale Water & Power. ""Ther=
e=20
is a pretty decent trade-off, helping our neighbors in the state to keep=20
their lights on,"" he said.
?????A USC specialist warned that increased power plant emissions raise the=

risks of asthma and other lung ailments in the young and old.
?????""There is a potential for more emergency room visits, more people seei=

?????With extended hours, the Glendale generators are emitting as much as 9=
95=20
pounds of pollutants into the air during peak demand, more than double the=
=20
old limit of 390 pounds a day, city and air-quality officials said.
?????The other 14 power plants in Southern California also have more than=
=20
doubled their overall emissions, according to preliminary figures from the=
=20
South Coast Air Quality Management District. As a group, the plants emitted=
 a=20
total of 2,045 tons of smog-forming nitrogen oxide in the first three month=
s=20
of 2001, compared with 905 tons for the same period last year.
?????The AQMD hearing board on Tuesday eased pollution controls so Glendale=
=20
may continue to generate excess electricity for sale to the energy-starved=
=20
state. Under the plan, Glendale may run three of its old steam boilers=20
around-the-clock to meet the state's energy demand. Usually, these boilers,=
=20
hidden behind a tall brick wall, sit idle except during the peak summer=20
demand because they are inefficient and costly.
?????Glendale, like Burbank and the Los Angeles Department of Water and=20
Power, continues to produce electricity at its city-owned plant. The three=
=20
cities opted against participating in a scheme of deregulation, a decision=
=20
that has shielded their residents, by and large, from the huge utility rate=
=20
hikes and rolling power outages experienced elsewhere. But they also will=

contribute to easing the state's energy emergency in the dirtier air they=

will be forced to breathe.
?????Air-quality officials said power plants contribute just about 3% of th=

900 tons of pollution emitted into the air daily, with about 70% of the=20
pollution coming from vehicles, not factories. And in recent years, many of=

the region's municipal power generators have been updated with=20
pollution-control devices that reduce emissions.
?????Glendale's three steam generators, built between 1953 and 1963, are=20
inefficient by today's standards, but they are 85% cleaner since the city=

pumped millions of dollars into upgrades. They will be even cleaner, city=

officials say, with more retrofitting.
?????Under the plan, Glendale must reinvest profits from energy sales,=20
estimated at $3 million to $5 million this year, in equipment to reduce=20
future emissions at the plant and in community-based programs, such as mobi=

50,000 homes. Under the decision Tuesday, pollution limits resume Jan. 1,=

2002, or when the energy emergency ends.
?????In Los Angeles, power officials said they don't expect to exceed AQMD=

caps, because they are adding pollution controls at two of the city's four=

d=20
Angelina Galiteva, LADWP's director of strategic planning.
?????""We will have much cleaner equipment in place by June,"" she said.
?????Even the environmentalists are trying to balance the risks.

said Sheryl Carter, a senior policy analyst for the National Resources=20

?????Carter said natural-gas-powered generators, like the ones in Glendale,=

Power Plant Plan Worries Neighbors=20

Energy crisis: Regulators will decide next week whether to allow Huntington=

Beach facility to boost output. Noise and pollution are concerns.=20

By CHRISTINE HANLEY, Times Staff Writer=20

?????On Hula Circle in Huntington Beach, families have tried to live with=
=20
their two very different neighbors. They live steps from the Pacific Ocean=
=20
but next door to the mechanical shrieks and foul smells of the massive AES=
=20
Corp. power plant.
?????But California's power crisis is rapidly unhinging life in the=20
neighborhood of ranch houses and bungalows.
?????State regulators will decide next week whether to allow the company to=

double the plant's operations by July, providing much-needed electricity bu=
t=20
taking what residents fear will be a heavy toll on them.
?????It's one of several proposals to restart or build new power plants in=
=20
the wake of the power crisis using a ""fast track"" process that allows the=
=20
projects to go forward before environmental and pollution studies are=20
completed.
?????""The plant is so close. We want to know if it is impacting our kids in=
=20
ways we won't know about until 10 years from now,"" said Janette Mortimer, w=
ho=20
lives with her husband and their two young children in one of the homes=20
closest to the plant.
?????Already, residents say, the AES plant is casting a mightier shadow.=20
There are the ear-ringing rumbles and roars. There are the mysterious plume=
s=20
of smoke that waft over the neighborhood. Then there is the grime that seem=
s=20
never to go away.
?????If the California Energy Commission approves the permit for AES, the=
=20
facility could run at full capacity for the first time in memory. Officials=
=20
said the plant's previous owner, Southern California Edison, typically ran =
it=20
at 30% of capacity.
?????AES could be allowed to run the four gas-fired boilers and a ""peaker""=
=20
unit whenever California hits a Stage 3 alert--which is expected to happen=
=20
often this summer. The ""peaker"" plant alone is powered by eight jet=20
engines--and sounds like it.
?????Currently, only two boilers are operating.
?????But residents say they are most worried about the air they breathe and=
=20
the water they swim in.
?????Under the fast-tracking process designed to get more electricity for t=
he=20
state as soon as possible, several key environmental questions have yet to =
be=20
studied.
?????Scientists studying the cause of ocean pollution that closed much of=
=20
Huntington Beach's shoreline in the summer of 1999 said that the plant, alo=
ng=20
with other factors, played a role by drawing partially treated sewage that =
is=20
discharged miles offshore back toward the coast.
?????AES Inc. will pay $1.5 million to further study the issue, but the=20
research won't be complete for some time.
?????""So much is uncertain,"" said Huntington Beach Councilwoman Shirley=20
Dettloff. ""These are big, big things.""
?????For now, residents say they are bracing for more noise, smoke and=20
disruption.
?????To begin with, AES' proposal calls for 20 hours a day of nonstop=20
construction to get the two mothballed generators in service by July.
?????Then there are the sizzling summer temperatures. Residents usually ope=
n=20
their windows to let the ocean breezes cool their homes. But the noise and=
=20
smells from the plants may make that impossible.
?????""It's going to be bad. There's no escape,"" said Bryan Visnoski.
?????The plant has towered over the Huntington Beach coastline for nearly 4=
0=20
years. The housing tracts came later, but most inhabitants of Hula Circle a=
nd=20
surrounding streets seemed to make peace with their industrial neighbor.
?????Some have installed double-paned windows to dampen the sound. Others=
=20
have remodeled their homes to obstruct ugly views. The Mortimers grew tall=
=20
trees and trained vines past the windows.
?????The problems, they say, began with the energy crisis.
?????The plant was owned by Edison until 1998, when it was sold to=20
AES--California's largest private electricity producer--at the dawn of=20
deregulation.
?????The two gas-fired boilers that AES wants to restart have been dormant=
=20
since 1995 and were slated for demolition until the power crisis struck.
?????But a few months ago as rolling blackouts hit the state, Gov. Gray Dav=
is=20
signed an executive order allowing ""peaker plants"" to operate at extended=
=20
hours. ""Peaker plants"" can produce electricity in quick bursts but guzzle=
=20
large amounts of natural gas and are noisy.
?????Hulu Circle residents said the order has resulted in more hours of lou=
d=20
jet noises that make then feel like they live by an airport.
?????Whenever the peaker plant goes on, residents call the Air Quality=20
Management District to send someone to test the plume of smoke. The=20
inspections have not detected any violations.
?????The proposal before the state Energy Commission would allow AES to=20
double its electricity output in Huntington Beach from 500 megawatts to 1,0=

S&P lowers California's bond rating=20
First cut since '94 could cost taxpayers millions=20

Citing the ""rapidly escalating uncertainty"" surrounding the power crisis,=
=20
Standard & Poor's slashed California's credit rating yesterday for the firs=
t=20
time since 1994, when the state was still climbing out of a recession.=20
The downgrade -- and the energy debacle that led up to it -- will cost=20
taxpayers tens or hundreds of millions of dollars a year by raising the=20
state's borrowing costs. Investors will probably see the market price of=20
California municipal bonds and bond funds decline further.=20
But the biggest blow may be to the state's ego. S&P downgraded the state's=
=20
general obligation bonds two notches -- to A+ from AA. The only other state=
=20
currently rated A+ is Hawaii. The only state with a lower credit rating is=
=20
Louisiana, according to S&P.=20
Most states are rated AA. Some states don't have a credit rating because th=
ey=20
don't have bonds.=20
California's credit rating is still ""investment grade,"" which means it is n=
ot=20
expected to default on its bonds. However, the state's ability to repay its=
=20
debt ""isn't as strong as it used to be,"" said Steve Zimmermann, a managing=
=20
director with Standard & Poor's. ""This is a very speculative situation.""=20
States hire companies like S&P to give them an independent credit rating wh=
en=20
they borrow money by selling bonds. The rating reflects the state's ability=
=20
to repay its debt in full, on time.=20
When they sell new bonds, states with lower credit ratings usually pay high=
er=20
interest than higher-rated states, to make up for the added risk.=20
A rating change does not affect the interest rate states pay on bonds that=
=20
have already been issued, but it can affect the price of bonds when they=20
trade on the open market among investors.=20
Yesterday's downgrade ""reflects the mounting and uncertain cost to the stat=
e=20
of the current electrical power crisis, as well as its likely long-term=20
detrimental effect on the state's economy,"" S&P said in a news release.=20
""Given the large magnitude of the problem in relation to the size of fund=
=20
balances the state typically budgets, the capacity to pay debt service, whi=
le=20
still adequate, has been reduced.""=20
In January, S&P placed the state's debt on ""CreditWatch with negative=20
implications,"" a signal that it might lower the rating.=20
In an unusual move, S&P kept the state on CreditWatch after yesterday's=20
downgrade, which means the rating could fall even lower.=20
Zimmermann said S&P is keeping California on CreditWatch pending its abilit=
y=20
to sell $10 billion to $14 billion worth of bonds to reimburse the state's=
=20
general fund for past and future power purchases.=20
""If they did the bond issue, they'd replenish the fund, at least for the=20
short term. If they don't do it, then it's more of a concern,"" Zimmermann=
=20
said.=20
Unfortunately, the downgrade could make it harder for the state to sell the=
=20
bonds.=20
""If they could have gotten the deal done before the downgrade, they would=
=20
have had a stronger deal,"" said Kelly Mainelli, a municipal bond fund manag=
er=20
with Montgomery Asset Management.=20
California must obtain an investment-grade rating (BBB- or higher) on the=
=20
bonds before it can sell them.=20
Mainelli said California municipal bond prices have already fallen in=20
anticipation of a ratings cut. When prices fall, bond yields go up.=20
""The downgrade is the culmination of everything that's happened since early=
=20
December,"" he said.=20
In November, California municipal bonds yields were 0.4 to 0.5 percentage=
=20
points below the national average. Today, they're 0.1 to 0.2 percentage=20
points above the national average, and Mainelli thinks they could go up 0.1=
=20
to 0.2 percentage points more because of the downgrade.=20
The total difference -- about 0.7 percentage points -- doesn't sound like=
=20
much, but it adds up.=20
Last year, the state itself sold $4.6 billion in new bonds (excluding bonds=
=20
sold to replace existing bonds). If it sells the same amount this year, plu=
s=20
$12 billion in energy bonds, that 0.7 percentage point difference on $16.6=
=20
billion in bonds would cost the state $116 million a year in additional=20
interest costs.=20
Yesterday's downgrade only affected the state's general obligation bonds an=
d=20
others secured by the ""full faith and credit of the state,"" such as the=20
California Health Facilities Construction Loan Insurance Fund (Cal Mortgage=
).=20
But the energy debacle could wind up costing other municipal bond issuers i=
n=20
California -- such as cities, counties, school and water districts -- more=
=20
money when they sell bonds. Although their ratings have not changed because=
=20
of the energy crisis, analysts say the yields on most California municipal=
=20
bonds have gone up, and will go up some more, as a result of the state's=20
downgrade.=20
""The values of all California bonds will be hurt by this downgrade, whether=
=20
they should be or not. Psychologically, it's just how the market reacts,""=
=20
says Richard Goldstein, a San Ramon financial planner.=20
Investors who have to sell their California bonds on the open market before=
=20
they mature may not get all their principal back. But investors who hold=20
their bonds until maturity will probably get paid in full, Goldstein said.=
=20
No matter how bad the energy crisis gets, most experts believe the state wi=
ll=20
continue making principal and interest payments on its bonds, even if it ha=

Will price caps deter investment, as federal regulators say?=20

(04-25) 00:43 PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Some key power generators say=20
California's dearth of energy supplies, and its growing demand, make it a=
=20
good place to build more plants and sell more power in the years to come --=
=20
even if dreaded price caps are imposed.=20
``Regardless of what the (market) structure turns out to be, the state's=20
going to need electricity and it's going to need to buy it from somebody,''=
=20
said Bill Highlander, spokesman for San Jose-based Calpine Corp.=20
Calpine is investing about $4 billion in power plants over the next four=20
years that will generate 9,000 megawatts, enough for more than 6 million=20
homes. The state's current energy crisis ``hasn't really changed our plans =
or=20
our strategy,'' he said.=20
But Chief federal energy regulator Curtis Hebert says price caps on wholesa=
le=20
electricity will hinder, not help, California's energy crisis.=20
Energy wholesalers seeking higher prices than California is willing to pay=
=20
will invest in other states, warns Hebert, the chairman of the Federal Ener=
gy=20
Regulatory Commission. And any regulations that cut into future profits wil=
l=20
scare away desperately needed new power plants, he says.=20
Eight of the 13 new power plants approved in California already are under=
=20
construction. Twelve more are under review, according to the California=20
Energy Commission, which approves power plants.=20
CEC spokesman Rob Schlichting said that's a huge boost over the last decade=
,=20
when uncertainty over the rules of deregulation -- not a threat of price ca=
ps=20
-- kept applications down. No companies have withdrawn plans to build plant=
s=20
since December.=20
``The only way price caps would scare away investment is if they were set s=
o=20
low you couldn't make a profit,'' Schlichting said. ``It's still a market=
=20
that people seem to want to come in and produce power for.''=20
Other companies still planning to invest in California include North=20
Carolina-based Duke Energy, which has two plants in the works, and=20
Houston-based Reliant Energy, which is negotiating with the state to sell=
=20
power on long-term contracts.=20
Reliant's spokesman, Richard Wheatley, wouldn't say whether price caps alon=
e=20
would inhibit them from building more plants. What he did say is that=20
California's power politics leave a lot of room for improvement.=20
The state has considered taking over power plants through eminent domain an=
d=20
implementing a windfall profits tax to take some of their earnings away.=20
Meanwhile, Attorney General Bill Lockyer is offering a bounty for any=20
information that could prove wholesalers worked together to drive up prices=
,=20
which could lead to more lawsuits and investigations.=20
If California wants to encourage construction, it's got to tone down its=20
vilification and stop adding more restrictions, Wheatley said.=20
``Whenever we go into an area and consider building a power plant, we have =
to=20
look at the economics of the facility, we have to look at the regulatory=20
situation, esoteric things like what the mindset is like,'' he said.=20
``California is not the easiest place in which to do business.''=20
Some power companies have invested so much in pipelines, gas reserves and=
=20
plants already under construction that it's folly to turn back now.=20
``We want to build in California, but we need to have regulatory stability =
or=20
at least regulatory clarity to move these things forward because they're=20
half-billion dollar projects in some cases,'' said Tom Williams, a spokesma=
n=20
for Duke. ``That's a lot of bananas.''=20
Senators Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Gordon Smith, R-Ore., plan this we=
ek=20
to introduce legislation urging FERC to impose a temporary price cap over t=
he=20
11 Western states. They hope to keep prices down in the short-term and give=
=20
California and other troubled states a breather to make long-term decisions=
.=20
Feinstein's bill does not yet specify a price. Some economists say $150 to=
=20
$250 per megawatt hour would be just and reasonable, yet provide generators=
 a=20
profit. Prices have gone as high as $1,500 for the same amount of power in=
=20
the past year.=20
Tying the price cap to the cost of making power could make it easier for=20
generators to swallow, said Severin Borenstein, director of the University =
of=20
California, Berkeley's energy institute. Such a cap would account for=20
variables such as the wildly fluctuating cost of natural gas used to genera=
te=20
much of the energy in California's power plants.=20
Price caps can be effective, but only if they are very carefully designed,=
=20
warned Frank Wolak, chairman of the Independent System Operator's market=20
surveillance committee. The ISO manages the state's power grid.=20
Set them too high, and companies will only bid that amount, saving little=
=20
money, Wolak said. Too low, and the generators could choose to sell elsewhe=
re=20
unless all other nearby states have the same price limits.=20
Also, capping the most expensive energy sales -- power sold on the spot=20
market at times of high demand -- won't lower prices for other key componen=
ts=20
of the state's energy supply, such as electricity bought for the next day's=
=20
power needs.=20
``Suppose you're paying $150 every single (megawatt) hour. That still puts =
us=20
in big trouble with wholesale energy costs,'' Wolak said.=20
The state already has spent $5.1 billion buying power for customers of=20
California's three largest investor-owned utilities, which lost their credi=
t=20
-- and thus their ability to buy power -- after paying sharply higher costs=
=20
for wholesale energy.=20
Borenstein said paying even $250 a megawatt hour is still preferable to the=
=20
unknown, particularly since economists have warned that there is virtually =
no=20
upper limit to what energy companies can charge.=20
``This summer we are going to be truly short of power and at those times th=
e=20
price is going to be at the price cap, and if we don't have a price cap, th=
ey=20
will be way above the price cap,'' Borenstein said.=20
FERC remains opposed to price caps, but after months of complaints, the boa=
rd=20
this week is considering a limited cap on the most expensive last-minute=20
power buys.=20
The proposal would cap California but not the rest of the West, and order=

wholesalers to sell to the state during the most extreme power shortages.=
=20
Though it provides some cushioning, it does not address the high prices=20
California swallows the rest of the time. That's the point of Feinstein's=
=20
bill.=20
``The crisis point is this summer to next summer and we need some federal=
=20
assistance,'' said Howard Gantman, spokesman for Feinstein. ``This would=20

State bond rating lowered=20
Posted at 10:53 p.m. PDT Tuesday, April 24, 2001=20
BY JENNIFER BJORHUS=20

Mercury News=20


One of Wall Street's top credit-rating houses has downgraded California's=
=20
bonds because of the state's handling of the energy crisis, a move that cou=
ld=20
ultimately cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars.=20
Saying that mounting and uncertain power costs are likely to do lasting har=
m=20
to California's economy, New York-based Standard & Poor's on Tuesday lowere=
d=20
the state's credit rating on its ``general obligation'' bonds two notches,=
=20
from AA to A+ with a negative outlook. That puts California near the bottom=
=20
of the state bond heap with only one state -- Louisiana -- rated lower.=20
Standard & Poor's said the rating could go lower if the state cannot resolv=
e=20
the power crisis.=20
The downgrade will cost California millions of dollars in coming years=20
because a lower rating makes it more expensive for the state to issue gener=
al=20
obligation bonds to finance projects such as school construction.=20
The interest on those bonds, which will rise from an estimated 5 to perhaps=
=20
5.25 percent, is paid from the state's tax-financed general fund. Although=
=20
the rating change doesn't apply technically to the different type of bond t=
he=20
state plans to issue by June for power purchases, it will probably make tho=
se=20
bonds more expensive for the state, too, bond experts say.=20
Heightened urgency=20
``There's a sense of urgency that this problem has been escalating,=20
particularly since the PG&E bankruptcy,'' said David Hitchcock, California=
=20
analyst for Standard & Poor's. ``This problem could move quickly.''=20
At least one bond expert said the downgrade was surprising.=20
``To me it's clear that S&P doesn't have much faith in this power-bailout=
=20
plan of the Legislature and the governor. To me that's the reason they did=
=20
it,'' said Zane Mann, publisher of the monthly California Bond Advisor=20
newsletter.=20
No single new piece of information triggered the downgrade, Hitchcock said.=
=20
The major factor, he said, was simply spiraling costs and no long-term plan=
=20
for paying the bills. Last week Gov. Gray Davis said the state had been=20
spending $73 million a day to buy electricity, up from $45.8 million a day =
in=20
late March. Hitchcock said some energy traders suspect the actual costs are=
=20
higher.=20
All three major Wall Street credit-rating agencies have California on=20
so-called ``credit watch,'' but only Standard & Poor's has downgraded. One=
=20
municipal bond expert said Standard & Poor's had been ``trigger happy'' and=
=20
eager to downgrade. Raymond Murphy, Moody's California analyst, said he had=
=20
no immediate plans to change California's bond rating, but that he's anxiou=
s=20
to see officials produce a long-term plan for financing power purchases.=20
Murphy said he had a conference call with state officials about the issue=
=20
Tuesday morning.=20
``We want the state to develop the plan that gets the general fund out of=
=20
power purchasing,'' Murphy said.=20
The state says it's working on that, but there's a roadblock.=20
Revenue bonds=20
A major piece of the state's plan is to have the Department of Water=20
Resources issue $10 billion to $14 billion in revenue bonds to pay back the=
=20
general fund for what has been taken to buy power in recent months. But tha=
t=20
portion of the plan is tied up in a dispute between PG&E and the California=
=20
Public Utilities Commission over how to spend the extra money generated by=
=20
electricity rate increases. The dispute has also held up the $4.13 billion =
in=20
financing the state had arranged to pay down the advances it took out of th=
e=20
general fund to buy power.=20
To break the logjam, officials from the state treasurer's office have asked=
=20
lawmakers to pass emergency legislation to allow the state to issue the=20
revenue bonds.=20
``California's credit rating and financial strength will be in jeopardy unt=
il=20
the state's general fund is repaid for energy costs,'' state Treasurer Phil=
ip=20
Angelides said in a statement Tuesday.=20
State Finance Director Tim Gage and Gov. Davis both downplayed the=20
significance of the rate change. Through a press officer, Davis said the=20
state's economy remains fundamentally strong.=20
The state was downgraded to a lower A rating in 1994 and went on to see=20
tremendous economic growth.=20
Mounting pressure=20
Still, a downgrade is bad news that sends a psychological signal in both th=
e=20
finance and real worlds. Some industry watchers said they hope the downgrad=
e=20
pushes lawmakers and state officials, whom they perceive to be too slow in=
=20
responding to the crisis.=20
``It sounds like the bond market might be out ahead of some of the=20
policy-makers in California,'' said Severin Borenstein, director of the=20
University of California Energy Institute. ``We're facing a real emergency=
=20
here.''=20
John Hallacy, managing director of municipal research at Merrill Lynch, sai=
d=20
a lower credit rating puts more pressure on the state to issue the revenue=
=20
bonds fast, and to conserve cash.=20
``We're kind of at the critical juncture now where the pieces are still all=
=20
over the floor,'' Hallacy said of the state's efforts to build and approve =
a=20
long-term solution to the power crisis.=20
To Nettie Hoge, executive director of the Utility Reform Network and a=20
leading critic of the state's efforts to bail out PG&E and Southern=20
California Edison, the downgrade means ``the analysts are watching.'' She=
=20
said she hopes that President Bush and the Federal Energy Regulatory=20
Commission are watching, too.=20
``Hopefully, this is a wake-up call for FERC. Those guys could solve this i=

Q&A with Gov. Gray Davis on energy issues=20
Gov. Gray Davis visited the Mercury News editorial board Monday. On the=20
subject of electricity, Davis talked about increasing the number of power=
=20
plants, the rejection of price caps by the Federal Energy Regulatory=20
Commission, and the condition of the state's two largest utilities, Souther=
n=20
California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. Davis has proposed a deal to=
=20
rescue Edison, and the Legislature is considering it. PG&E has filed for=20
bankruptcy.=20
Here is a condensed version of Davis' remarks.=20
Q: What would you like to say by way of introduction about the state's=20
electricity problems?=20
Davis: There are really two problems. One is the amount of power available=
=20
and the other is the price of power.=20
In 2002, we'll have more megawatts on line, at least 5,000 more. By 2003,=
=20
we'll have a slight excess of power over demand. That's very important.=20
Because at the moment, we import 20 percent of our power. We have no=20
leverage. We are at the mercy of forces that show no mercy. That will never=
=20
change until we have more power than we need.=20
OK, price. As you know, the only entity that can influence the [wholesale]=
=20
price of electricity is the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.=20
Deregulation surrendered the ability of the state to do that.=20
In 1999, this state for all power, including municipal power, spent roughly=
=20
$7 billion. In 2000, we spent $32.5 billion. I don't know what it will be=
=20
this year, but it will be substantially higher.=20
Through all this the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has refused to do=
 a=20
thing, zero, zippo. Lest you think I'm being partisan, that commission=20
consists entirely of Clinton appointees.=20
The final piece is the financial consequences of what's happened to date. I=
t=20
is our hope that if we can keep Southern California Edison credit-worthy an=
d=20
able to re-enter the power purchasing market Jan. 1, 2003, we can then go t=
o=20
the PG&E creditors committee [the generators to whom PG&E owes money] and s=
ay=20
to them: ``Look at the arrangement we made with Southern California Edison.=
=20
We believe that this is a far better deal than PG&E can give you.''=20
I think this is a fair plan. We get every electron that Edison's utility ow=
ns=20
committed for 10 years, at a cost-of-service basis. Under [current law] the=
y=20
could sell that next March at market rates. We got $400 million returned fr=
om=20
the holding company, a $3 billion investment in the transmission and delive=
ry=20
systems .?.?. a permanent easement on about 20,000 acres of environmental=
=20
property around all their hydro facilities.=20
Q: Do you have in mind a finished product for the changes that are happenin=
g=20
in the electric system? What will it look like in a couple of years?=20
Davis: It is my expectation that the utilities will be purchasing the power=
=20
entirely, commencing Jan. 1, 2003. Our goal is to get them back in business=
.=20
In addition to investor-owned utilities, I believe we also need a public=20
power authority. At some point I believe the private sector will say to=20
itself, ``I want to build new plants to replace the 40-year-old plants, but=
=20
do I really want to get the state to a 15 percent margin over supply, there=
by=20

Q: There's an impression that the state budget is being drained by the powe=

Davis: The simple answer to that is no, because the state will be fully=20

At the moment, in the short term, it is crowding out other spending. But I=

Power Companies and Regulators Must Take Steps To Avoid Spread of=20
California Power Virus/ Andersen Analysis



WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 24, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -
A ""new virus spawned
in California"" poses formidable challenges requiring new strategies on
the part of power companies, regulators and policymakers to contain
and reverse its damage, according to ""Energy Crisis in the Western
United States: Lessons for Navigating Regulatory and Market
Minefields,"" a new Andersen report released today.


""The implications for the development of competitive energy
markets go far beyond the Western United States,"" Andersen's national
utility practice head Matthew D. Smith told a Washington briefing.
""Unfortunately, California has taught the nation that regulatory and
political barriers can create and sustain an energy crisis.""


""California has demonstrated that the risks in the electricity
industry, if not properly acknowledged and managed, can simultaneously
and profoundly impact all market participants. To be effectively
managed, these risks need to be exposed, assumed or shared, measured
and monitored. When they are hidden or ignored, all parties can
potentially suffer. A shared, integrated view of these risks, and a
strategy for their assumption and management, is critical to avoiding
rapid value destruction within the energy market,"" Smith said.


An Andersen survey of senior utility executives outside
California, also released at the briefing, indicates most utility
companies believe they inoculated themselves against the California
virus so that it is unlikely to affect their operations beyond slowing
the pace of deregulation and increasing investor scrutiny. However,
based on the potential implications it sees of the California
situation, Andersen believes a series of booster shots are advisable
for power companies and regulators. ""To deliver reliable service at a
predictable cost in today's environment, companies must focus on
market integration by developing new and innovative relationships
between suppliers, customers, employees and investors -- while working
with government officials and regulators to chart a smoother
transition to a deregulated power market,"" according to Smith.


Eight Implications


The Andersen report identified eight overriding implications
emanating from the Western energy crisis that are shaping the
longer-term operations of the Western grid, the regional and national
economy, domestic energy policy and the industry's evolution:


1.  Increased deregulation uncertainty and risk -- Tension and


differences between state and federal regulators raise the


specter of repeating the regulatory and political conundrum


California's investor-owned utilities have faced. If federal


initiatives open wholesale markets while retail markets remain


regulated, a crucial question is raised: Will state regulators


pass-through higher wholesale costs if they should


materialize? Tensions between state and federal regulators


over policies on deregulation will grow if states delay or


abandon retail competition.


As wholesale markets are deregulated and RTOs begin operating,


the prudence principles that state regulators have used for


many years may have to be changed. For example, if FERC and


RTO monitors determine that deregulated wholesale markets


operate fairly, prices derived from those markets must be


considered reasonable. If so, these costs should be allowed


into state-regulated retail rates without regard to the


prudence principles state regulators have used for years.


Therefore, utilities' traditional burden of proving costs are


or are not justifiable shifts to regulators.


2.  Reduced investor confidence -- Prior to deregulation,


stringent prudence review and disallowance of generation costs


in the rate base made regulatory risk largely uncontrollable,


killing IOU interests in most new investment. A major purpose


of deregulation was to create an environment in which risk


could be managed, but California's political and regulatory


environment provides only a limited ability to manage risks.


The confidence and perceptions needed to support investment


decision-making will be slow to return given the approach of


the state to remedy the crisis.


3.  Contributing factor in economic softening -- Uncertain energy


reliability and higher costs can drive-out marginal


businesses, cause healthy companies to constrain expansion,


and lead new entrants to question whether to make new


investments. As such, an extended energy crisis contributes to


inflation pressures and may slow economic growth.


4.  Increased pressure on the Western grid -- Even as capacity


increases and demand reductions work to resolve the California


crisis, these solutions have long-term implications for the


Western Grid. These include a realistic possibility of


California becoming an ""energy island"" as a result of


near-term reduction in available regional resources for export


to California; increased emphasis on security control to


protect against overall Western grid failure as sub-regions


have problems; RTO requirements to strengthen locally


available supplies to bolster overall system reliability;


longer-term development of new plants using plentiful coal


resources and clean coal technology will alter the pattern of


imports into California; and the emergence of Mexico as a


major supplier to southern California and Arizona,


contributing to a bifurcation of the Western Grid into


northern and southern markets.


5.  Unbundling failures that push companies back to portfolio


strategies -- For California investor-owned utilities,


unbundling has achieved neither the least-cost solution sought


by regulators nor value maximization targeted by investors.


This necessitates a reevaluation of portfolio management


strategies potentially involving generation, transmission,


power trading and marketing, and retail businesses in multiple


geographies serving multiple markets.


6.  Ineffectiveness in changing siting and development


restrictions -- California's retail price caps and multiple


explanations for the crisis have left accelerated siting


processes and environmental standards changes open to


challenge by various interests. In addition, limiting


application of new siting orders only to small generators


contributes to uncertainty and investor hesitancy.


7.  Procurement management that alters user-utility negotiating


leverage -- Competitive markets compel participants --


suppliers, marketers, large industrial buyers, etc. -- to


strategically manage procurement as a critical value-driver.


Because risk is explicitly shared and always has the potential


of shifting advantage to either seller or buyer, the


sophistication of negotiations and contracts increases as


competitive markets evolve.


8.  Increased emphasis on distributed generation and new


technologies -- California's reliability and price challenges


have triggered a re-emergence of energy crisis measures from


the 1970s. End-users are investing in solutions they control,


and the distributed generation market is being aggressively


developed among large retailers, industrial users and


residential customers. This makes possible the development of


microgrids connecting consumers in local areas and related


changes in traditional grid systems, from modifications in


interconnection agreements to changing definitions of reserve


margins and system reliability.


Industry Executives' Response


Senior executives from sixteen non-California utilities with a
combined market capitalization over $120 billion and $145 billion in
revenues responded to an Andersen survey with their views of the
implications of the California power crisis for their companies and
for the industry. The survey, conducted between February 19, 2001 and
March 2, 2001 by Knowledge Systems &amp; Research, Inc. of Syracuse, found
that the companies are observing the California situation carefully,
expect a slowing -- but not a turnaround -- of deregulation, and
believe their internal plans and preparations are on-target for the
changing environment:


--  Deregulation -- Nearly all executives believe recent


California events will slow the pace of deregulation over the


next five years for states that have not begun or finished


writing restructuring legislation. None believe that it will


cause advanced states to re-regulate markets, although many


states will review their legislation to assess their risk of


duplicating California's current situation and make any


changes necessary to avoid it.


--  National legislation -- Few executives suggest the situation


will initiate national energy policy/legislation; others


believe it will be a continuing issue but, because of


state-to-state variances, Congress will be unable to pass any


comprehensive measures or force states to a restructuring


timeline. Some expect additional state-level legislation.


--  Company strategies -- Most do not see any changes to their


business models or strategies for generation, distribution or


supply procurement as a response to the situation in


California. However, many have expanded their risk management


programs, reduced spot market purchases, begun emphasizing


long-term supply contracts, planning new power generation


capacity, and started hedging with futures trades. Those


facing price caps are rethinking their stance on them.


--  Investor scrutiny -- Many executives indicate their


shareholders are aware of the situation and investors --


particularly institutional investors -- are more heavily


scrutinizing their actions. Many say news coverage has


prompted retail, commercial and industrial customer skepticism


of industry restructuring.


--  Transmission deregulation -- Many executives agree the


California situation will increase interest in FERC's regional


transmission organizations (RTO) deregulation effort.


Utility Company Action Items


Both to guard against a sudden California cascade and as a
potentially powerful competitive thrust, forward-thinking utilities
should bolster their basic preparedness with a variety of tactics --
or inoculations -- specifically aimed to combat a potential California
power virus, according to Andersen partner Mark Moskovitz:


--  Improve procurement management and risk management


capabilities -- To manage exposure to volatile supply and


demand shifts, organizations must be sure that comprehensive


and clear supply procedures, controls, decision points, risk


limits and communications are in place.


--  Plan and design innovative rate and pricing structures --


Companies and regulators must focus on communicating price


signals that create value for both the customer and the


provider. Innovative rate and pricing structures that more


closely tie the customer's price to the real cost of supply


will better signal the value of the service as well as


providing more accurate information upon which both end user


and supplier can make decisions.


--  Increase emphasis on demand side management (DSM) strategies


-- In addition to new pricing strategies to help achieve and


maintain supply-demand equilibrium, companies must now focus


on employing more extensive and innovative demand side


management programs. These programs may offer significant


benefits with limited risk to both the customer and energy


supplier.


--  Assess the supply and generation dynamics in adjacent


jurisdictions -- Companies must take a broader view -- beyond


typical geographic market definitions -- of the economics of


generation and related business decisions in an increasingly


volatile market in which supply will follow the best prices.


--  Develop contingency plans for the continued deferral of new


generation capacity -- In the face of potential ongoing


generation capacity shortages, companies and regulators must


be prepared to move with a portfolio of strategies to meet


demand, including for example DSM, flexible pricing and


distributed generation. In addition, they should explore


efficiency-improving upgrades to existing facilities and seize


any opportunity to accelerate near-term construction plans.


--  Proactively address potential organizational disruption -- As


regulatory and economic changes continue to churn the industry


waters and companies adjust and/or restructure, they must be


highly cogniscent of, sensitive to, and directly address


employees' concerns with information about the company's


future and theirs'.


Industry/Regulatory Lessons


There are also a number of broad primary lessons the electric
power industry -- nationally and internationally -- should take away
from its first major domestic test case in deregulation and
restructuring, according to Andersen principal David O. Jermain:


--  Simplify market design.


--  Build a continuing role for regulators.


--  Maintain communications with multiple constituent interests.


--  Prepare contingency plans for extreme stress conditions.


--  Couple real-time retail pricing with transparently priced


wholesale competition.


--  Provide special incentives for RTO investment, formation and


development.


--  Break down regulatory and political barriers to market signals


and responses.

Soaring Temperatures Produce Call for Conservation;=20
California ISO Also Announces New Outage Notification System and On-call=20
Number



FOLSOM, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 24, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -
As the mercury
climbs this week, the California Independent System Operator
(California ISO) is reminding consumers to curb their electricity use
in order to minimize the strain on the power grid. The first warm
spell of the season is expected to cause temperatures to jump 10
degrees, leading to a 2,000 megawatt increase in electricity
consumption -- the equivalent of two large power plants. The week
started out with a peak demand of 28,835 megawatts, but by tomorrow it
is forecasted to top 30,500 megawatts. This comes as hydroelectricity
resources (both Northwest and California) run low, more than 10,000
megawatts of power plants remain off line due to planned and unplanned
maintenance, and some 3,000 megawatts of Qualifying Facilities or
alternative energy suppliers are not operating.


The California ISO's renewed call for conservation precedes a
forecast of 90 degree highs in the inland areas that may tempt many
Californians to flip on air conditioners. For conservation tips --
such as using fans instead of air conditioners, setting thermostat at
78 degrees, etc. -- please see the California ISO's web site
www.caiso.com.


New Notification System:


With a challenging summer around the corner, the California ISO
wants to do all it can to bring information to the public as quickly
as possible. For that reason, a new notification system is being
brought on line. Media and the public can now access the Internet to
keep current if rotating blackouts are issued.

Communications will no longer be posting on-call schedules for media
spokespersons on the web site. Simply call the on-call pager after
hours.


News releases alerting the media to electrical emergencies will
continue, as will news conferences held on-site in Folsom and via
telephone. As a reminder, if you wish to visit the ISO control rooms
(in Folsom or Alhambra) always call ISO Communications first at
888/516-NEWS to make an appointment. Access to the control rooms may

PELTZ, Times Staff Writer=20 ?????A debate now rages in California over whether price controls should be= =20 adopted to stem the state's soaring power costs and help consumers who are= =20 bracing for huge spikes in their electric bills. ?????But price controls are one of the most controversial actions in=20 economics--and in politics, for that matter. And now the caps are more in= =20 dispute than ever because they run counter to the nation's move over the la= st=20 two decades to deregulate more and more industries, from airlines to=20 railroads to energy. ?????Yet California is a good example of deregulation gone haywire, so=20 controls are again being demanded by lawmakers, consumer advocates and othe= rs=20 as a way to check surging prices. On the other side is a chorus of critics= =20 who ridicule price caps as being ineffective and, at times, making matters= =20 worse for consumers. ?????Case in point: the Golden State itself, which tried last summer to use= =20 temporary price caps to keep a lid on skyrocketing wholesale electricity=20 prices. ?????Critics claim that the caps drove power sales out of state, thus=20 widening the imbalance between supply and demand, reinforcing the existing= =20 shortages and contributing to this winter's rolling blackouts. ?????But defenders of the caps note that the dysfunctional California marke= t=20 had no way to self-correct. The utilities couldn't simply refuse to buy=20 electricity in the face of higher prices, and with no price ceiling in sigh= t,=20 something had to be done. ?????And now Gov. Gray Davis and others are again calling for temporary=20 controls until more electricity supplies can be added, especially as the=20 state enters the peak-power summer season. On Tuesday, Sens. Dianne Feinste= in=20 (D-Calif.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) introduced legislation that would impo= se=20 price controls on wholesale energy throughout 11 Western states. ?????Mindful of the controversial history of controls, Feinstein and Smith= =20 stressed that the caps would last only through March 1, 2003. But they also= =20 argued that the economic damage to industries and consumers from escalating= =20 power costs would exceed any harm caused by price controls. ?????""I have a strong preference for markets, but it's a mistake to believe= =20 that we have a free market when it comes to energy,"" said Smith, the only G= OP=20 co-sponsor of the legislation. ?????Their bill would require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, whi= ch=20 regulates U.S. wholesale electricity prices, either to impose a regional=20 price cap or institute a rate schedule for each power generator, tying the= =20 price of electricity to the cost of producing it. ?????Coincidentally, FERC today is expected to decide on various other=20 proposals to again limit California's power costs--but without explicitly= =20 stating that the plans include price controls. Why? Because the Bush=20 administration and FERC Chairman Curt Hebert Jr., among others, are on the= =20 record as adamantly opposing price caps. ?????That's not surprising. Price controls often are tagged as a liberal=20 maneuver that flies in the face of conservatives' free-market ideology. Yet= ,=20 ironically, hanging over the California debate is the legacy of a Republica= n=20 president who was the last one to mandate price controls on a nationwide=20 level: Richard M. Nixon. ?????The late president took that rare step 30 years ago this August to try= =20 to quell inflation and spark an economic rebound. His actions were so=20 dramatic that they are still invoked by those wanting to criticize or, in= =20 some cases, endorse setting limits on prices. ?????""What he did is almost larger than life now,"" said Shannon Burchett,= =20 chief executive of RiskLimited Corp., a strategic consulting firm in Dallas= . ?????Nixon's controls were the most far-reaching since World War II, when= =20 prices were capped so that profiteers couldn't reap huge sums for scarce=20 commodities being used for the war and simultaneously rationed at home. ?????In most cases, price controls have been much less sweeping and targete= d=20 at specific products or services. They don't always involve changing the la= w,=20 either. In 1962, President Kennedy publicly rebuked the then-U.S. Steel Cor= p.=20 and its chairman, Roger Blough, for starting an industrywide move to raise= =20 steel prices. The price hikes were rolled back a few days later. ?????Since Nixon, price controls have become rarer as industries that were= =20 once regulated--which means their prices were government-controlled--have= =20 been deregulated. ?????So it is in California, where electric utilities' prices were controll= ed=20 for decades until the state's deregulation law in 1996. But now that the la= w=20 has been blamed for the soaring wholesale prices, power shortages, crippled= =20 utilities and the need for a huge jump in ratepayers' costs, some again wan= t=20 price controls on electricity until the crisis eases. ?????Which brings everyone back to Nixon. ?????Some Nixon Controls Were Lifted by Reagan ?????""I've heard people make the analogy to what happened . . . when Nixon= =20 put on controls,"" but in California ""this is fundamentally different,"" said= =20 Mike Florio, a board member of the California Independent System Operator,= =20 which oversees most of the state's electricity grid. ?????""When you get into a situation of shortage [of supplies], there is=20 really no restraint at all on prices,"" said Florio, who said he normally=20 prefers unfettered markets but also defended the state's caps last summer.= =20 Such government intervention ""on a temporary basis is better than nothing,= =20 but I don't think it's ideal."" ?????The reverberations from Nixon's fiat aren't just felt in California=20 either. When New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani recently proposed more stringe= nt=20 controls on wholesale electricity costs in New York state, critics promptly= =20 pointed to Nixon's controls. ""They were a disaster,"" one columnist wrote. ?????Even Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who was in the private= =20 sector in the early 1970s, turned down several requests to take high-level= =20 White House jobs in part because he was disgusted with Nixon's price contro= ls. ?????Many economists and historians also judge Nixon's controls as a mistak= e.=20 But some maintain that his decision--which began with a 90-day freeze on=20 prices, wages and rents--wasn't entirely a failure and even provided ""shock= =20 value"" that, for a while at least, arrested higher inflation. ?????In addition, part of Nixon's move involved taking the dollar off the= =20 gold standard--which in effect meant its price was controlled--and letting = it=20 float in value against other major currencies. And that, many believe, is t= he=20 base upon which today's global financial markets operate. ?????Others disagree. ?????""There really isn't an example of where they've [price controls]=20 worked,"" said Robert Goldberg, a senior fellow at the National Center for= =20 Policy Analysis, a nonpartisan think tank in New York. ?????""Controls always lead to an underproduction"" of the commodity involved= =20 because producers don't have any incentive to spend more on additional=20 output, he said. When the caps ultimately are lifted, prices typically soar= =20 anyway as producers move to quickly recoup the profit they lost when the=20 controls were in place, Goldberg added. ?????Others note that although most of Nixon's price controls lasted only a= =20 couple of years, various forms of controls over crude oil and natural gas= =20 lasted for another decade until they were removed by President Ronald Reaga= n. ?????In the meantime, the controls--aggravated by embargoes and other suppl= y=20 cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries--distorted the fr= ee=20 market for energy, critics say. The controls kept U.S. oil prices=20 artificially low, which in turn kept demand for oil high, giving OPEC more= =20 power over world production and prices in the 1970s, they contend. ?????Nonetheless, proponents keep calling for controls when prices for=20 certain items seem to be spiraling out of control. ?????Critics Say Controls Worsen the Problems ?????President Clinton's massive health-reform proposal in the early 1990s= =20 included price controls on drugs. But the idea set off howls of protest fro= m=20 the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, and ultimately the entire= =20 proposal was shelved. Consumer advocates and others also demanded federal= =20 controls on rising cable TV rates in 1997 and 1998, again contending that t= he=20 cable operators were hiking prices at a much faster rate than inflation.=20 Cable firms were allowed to keep passing certain costs on to their=20 subscribers, but specific price caps weren't enacted. ?????But proponents of temporary price controls on California power emphasi= ze=20 that electricity isn't in the same category as an airplane seat, steel or= =20 other commodities that don't have to be bought if the price soars too high. ?????""In soybeans maybe the market can adjust quickly"" to changes in supply= =20 and demand, ""but in electric generation in California it can't,"" said Flori= o,=20 who also serves as an attorney for the Utility Reform Network, a consumer= =20 group. ""For most products, one of the ways prices get determined is if buye= rs=20 refuse to buy when the price gets too high. But that's generally not an=20 option for people when it comes to electricity."" ?????Critics of California's attempt to cap prices last summer said the=20 controls instead prompted many power suppliers to sell their electricity to= =20 other states. That ""actually made the tight-supply problem worse [in=20 California] by driving imports out of the state,"" the Bay Area Economic=20 Forum, a research group funded by regional business and government agencies= ,=20 said in a report last week. ?????Indeed, the temporary caps were basically abandoned by year's end to= =20 keep enough electricity in the state. ?????Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economics professor who heads the= =20 Independent System Operator's market surveillance committee, said there are= =20 ways to mitigate the state's power prices without having to set rigid=20 controls. One proposal: Have FERC require that generators supply 75% of the= ir=20 expected future sales to California under long-term contracts at ""just and= =20 reasonable"" prices set by the federal agency, he said. ?????That would ""send the right [price] signal to suppliers to come into th= e=20 state,"" Wolak said. ?????And because it will take time for California to get more of its own=20 power-generating plants up and running, the state's electricity crisis isn'= t=20 unlike a natural disaster in which ""normal public service is disrupted"" and= =20 short-term controls serve a purpose, Florio said. ?????""Over time, market forces will work"" and controls shouldn't be need, h= e=20 said.

Sklar arrived in Sarajevo to= =20 find that power was on for only two hours a day and set about expanding=20 electricity generation. ?????In an interview, Sklar said his father was a mechanical engineer who= =20 designed power stations. ?????""This power world is my world,"" Sklar said, adding that he had an=20 electric car and solar panels in the mid-1970s. ?????This Feb. 8, Davis announced at a news conference that he was appointi= ng=20 Larry Hamlin, a vice president of Southern California Edison, as his=20 ""construction czar."" Hamlin's job was to speed power plant construction. ?????Davis spokesman Roger Salazar said that Hamlin's stint was temporary a= nd=20 that the executive must return to Edison. Sklar's contract is for a longer= =20 period, Salazar said, but it is unclear how long. ?????Sklar is being retained as a consultant, paid $100,000 initially. Othe= r=20 firms, Salazar said, are loaning employees as volunteers. Joining Sklar wil= l=20 be representatives of the engineering and construction firms Bechtel, URS= =20 Corp. Engineering, Fluor Daniel, Parsons Brinckerhoff Quade & Douglas, and = A.=20 Teichert & Sons. At least one Bechtel subsidiary is involved in power plant= =20 construction in California. ?????""There is no conflict of interest,"" Sklar said, adding that no one in= =20 the group will have authority to decide who gets contracts. ?????A mechanical engineer, Sklar was president of the San Francisco-based= =20 construction management firm O'Brien Kreitzberg Inc. Sklar's firm also=20 oversaw construction of the Metro Rail Green Line in Los Angeles and the=20 rebuilding of the Los Angeles Central Library. ?????He was also chairman of the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission= =20 under then-Mayor Dianne Feinstein.

Feinstein's husband is a major invest= or=20 in URS, one of the firms that will loan employees to Sklar's team. ?????""He's very competent,"" said state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton= =20 (D-San Francisco) of Sklar, whom he met in 1972. ""He's a very good problem= =20 solver and he brooks no nonsense. . . . He's a renaissance man.

And those living downwind are subjected to twice as much= =20 air pollution as before California's energy crunch. ?????Not every Glendale resident is happy. ?????""You don't want anyone to get stuck with a rolling blackout, but we ge= t=20 struck with the pollution,"" Jerold Petrosian said as he and his family boug= ht=20 plants at a nursery across the street from the power plant. ""It is a tough= =20 decision."" ?????Not so for Ignacio Troncoso, director of Glendale Water & Power. ""Ther= e=20 is a pretty decent trade-off, helping our neighbors in the state to keep=20 their lights on,"" he said. ?????A USC specialist warned that increased power plant emissions raise the= =20 risks of asthma and other lung ailments in the young and old. ?????""There is a potential for more emergency room visits, more people seei= ng=20 their doctors and more hospitalizations this summer,"" said Dr. Henry Gong,= =20 professor of medicine and a specialist in the health effects of air polluti= on. ?????With extended hours, the Glendale generators are emitting as much as 9= 95=20 pounds of pollutants into the air during peak demand, more than double the= =20 old limit of 390 pounds a day, city and air-quality officials said. ?????The other 14 power plants in Southern California also have more than= =20 doubled their overall emissions, according to preliminary figures from the= =20 South Coast Air Quality Management District. As a group, the plants emitted= a=20 total of 2,045 tons of smog-forming nitrogen oxide in the first three month= s=20 of 2001, compared with 905 tons for the same period last year. ?????The AQMD hearing board on Tuesday eased pollution controls so Glendale= =20 may continue to generate excess electricity for sale to the energy-starved= =20 state. Under the plan, Glendale may run three of its old steam boilers=20 around-the-clock to meet the state's energy demand. Usually, these boilers,= =20 hidden behind a tall brick wall, sit idle except during the peak summer=20 demand because they are inefficient and costly. ?????Glendale, like Burbank and the Los Angeles Department of Water and=20 Power, continues to produce electricity at its city-owned plant. The three= =20 cities opted against participating in a scheme of deregulation, a decision= =20 that has shielded their residents, by and large, from the huge utility rate= =20 hikes and rolling power outages experienced elsewhere. But they also will= =20 contribute to easing the state's energy emergency in the dirtier air they= =20 will be forced to breathe. ?????Air-quality officials said power plants contribute just about 3% of th= e=20 900 tons of pollution emitted into the air daily, with about 70% of the=20 pollution coming from vehicles, not factories. And in recent years, many of= =20 the region's municipal power generators have been updated with=20 pollution-control devices that reduce emissions. ?????Glendale's three steam generators, built between 1953 and 1963, are=20 inefficient by today's standards, but they are 85% cleaner since the city= =20 pumped millions of dollars into upgrades. They will be even cleaner, city= =20 officials say, with more retrofitting. ?????Under the plan, Glendale must reinvest profits from energy sales,=20 estimated at $3 million to $5 million this year, in equipment to reduce=20 future emissions at the plant and in community-based programs, such as mobi= le=20 asthma clinics and programs to reduce school bus emissions. ?????The city plans to sell as much as 50 megawatts of power, enough to ser= ve=20 50,000 homes. Under the decision Tuesday, pollution limits resume Jan. 1,= =20 2002, or when the energy emergency ends. ?????In Los Angeles, power officials said they don't expect to exceed AQMD= =20 caps, because they are adding pollution controls at two of the city's four= =20 power plants. Although they will produce more electricity, they should not= =20 produce any more nitrogen oxide, which in sunlight and heat form ozone, sai= d=20 Angelina Galiteva, LADWP's director of strategic planning. ?????""We will have much cleaner equipment in place by June,"" she said. ?????Even the environmentalists are trying to balance the risks. ?????""We realize we have a problem this summer. We have to run these plants= ,""=20 said Sheryl Carter, a senior policy analyst for the National Resources=20 Defense Council. ?????Carter said natural-gas-powered generators, like the ones in Glendale,= =20 are ""a far superior solution to diesel generators,"" which produce 50 to 100= =20 times the emissions and would be turned on in businesses across the state i= f=20 energy is unavailable from other sources. ?????""We are trying to make sure the environment overall is made whole,"" sh= e=20 said. ?????Carl Zichella, regional staff director for the Sierra Club, said the= =20 generators should be run as a last resort. He also urged consumers to unplu= g=20 spare refrigerators and use energy-efficient light bulbs to reduce the=20 state's overall energy demand. ?????""The only thing that is going to work to offset air pollution is=20 efficiency,"" he said. Otherwise, ""we will pay not only with higher rates bu= t=20 also with our health."" ?????In neighboring Burbank, city officials are preparing for peak summer= =20 energy demands, when they expect to sell about 10% of their locally produce= d=20 electricity outside the city. ?????""For four or five years, we have been polluting Utah, Arizona, Nevada,= =20 Washington and Oregon, importing power to Los Angeles,"" said Ron Davis,=20 general manager of Burbank Water & Power, listing the energy-producing stat= es=20 that typically produce the bulk of Southern California's power. ""We are=20 returning the favor."" ?????Profits from those outside sales, Davis said, will help hold down=20 utility costs for local users. ?????""I think most people would take a little more smog to guarantee there= =20 are no rolling blackouts,"" he said.

Noise and pollution are concerns.=20 By CHRISTINE HANLEY, Times Staff Writer=20 ?????On Hula Circle in Huntington Beach, families have tried to live with= =20 their two very different neighbors. They live steps from the Pacific Ocean= =20 but next door to the mechanical shrieks and foul smells of the massive AES= =20 Corp. power plant. ?????But California's power crisis is rapidly unhinging life in the=20 neighborhood of ranch houses and bungalows. ?????State regulators will decide next week whether to allow the company to= =20 double the plant's operations by July, providing much-needed electricity bu= t=20 taking what residents fear will be a heavy toll on them. ?????It's one of several proposals to restart or build new power plants in= =20 the wake of the power crisis using a ""fast track"" process that allows the= =20 projects to go forward before environmental and pollution studies are=20 completed. ?????""The plant is so close. We want to know if it is impacting our kids in= =20 ways we won't know about until 10 years from now,"" said Janette Mortimer, w= ho=20 lives with her husband and their two young children in one of the homes=20 closest to the plant. ?????Already, residents say, the AES plant is casting a mightier shadow.=20 There are the ear-ringing rumbles and roars. There are the mysterious plume= s=20 of smoke that waft over the neighborhood. Then there is the grime that seem= s=20 never to go away. ?????If the California Energy Commission approves the permit for AES, the= =20 facility could run at full capacity for the first time in memory. Officials= =20 said the plant's previous owner, Southern California Edison, typically ran = it=20 at 30% of capacity. ?????AES could be allowed to run the four gas-fired boilers and a ""peaker""= =20 unit whenever California hits a Stage 3 alert--which is expected to happen= =20 often this summer. The ""peaker"" plant alone is powered by eight jet=20 engines--and sounds like it. ?????Currently, only two boilers are operating. ?????But residents say they are most worried about the air they breathe and= =20 the water they swim in. ?????Under the fast-tracking process designed to get more electricity for t= he=20 state as soon as possible, several key environmental questions have yet to = be=20 studied. ?????Scientists studying the cause of ocean pollution that closed much of= =20 Huntington Beach's shoreline in the summer of 1999 said that the plant, alo= ng=20 with other factors, played a role by drawing partially treated sewage that = is=20 discharged miles offshore back toward the coast. ?????AES Inc. will pay $1.5 million to further study the issue, but the=20 research won't be complete for some time. ?????""So much is uncertain,"" said Huntington Beach Councilwoman Shirley=20 Dettloff. ""These are big, big things."" ?????For now, residents say they are bracing for more noise, smoke and=20 disruption. ?????To begin with, AES' proposal calls for 20 hours a day of nonstop=20 construction to get the two mothballed generators in service by July. ?????Then there are the sizzling summer temperatures. Residents usually ope= n=20 their windows to let the ocean breezes cool their homes. But the noise and= =20 smells from the plants may make that impossible. ?????""It's going to be bad. There's no escape,"" said Bryan Visnoski. ?????The plant has towered over the Huntington Beach coastline for nearly 4= 0=20 years. The housing tracts came later, but most inhabitants of Hula Circle a= nd=20 surrounding streets seemed to make peace with their industrial neighbor. ?????Some have installed double-paned windows to dampen the sound. Others= =20 have remodeled their homes to obstruct ugly views. The Mortimers grew tall= =20 trees and trained vines past the windows. ?????The problems, they say, began with the energy crisis. ?????The plant was owned by Edison until 1998, when it was sold to=20 AES--California's largest private electricity producer--at the dawn of=20 deregulation. ?????The two gas-fired boilers that AES wants to restart have been dormant= =20 since 1995 and were slated for demolition until the power crisis struck. ?????But a few months ago as rolling blackouts hit the state, Gov. Gray Dav= is=20 signed an executive order allowing ""peaker plants"" to operate at extended= =20 hours. ""Peaker plants"" can produce electricity in quick bursts but guzzle= =20 large amounts of natural gas and are noisy. ?????Hulu Circle residents said the order has resulted in more hours of lou= d=20 jet noises that make then feel like they live by an airport. ?????Whenever the peaker plant goes on, residents call the Air Quality=20 Management District to send someone to test the plume of smoke. The=20 inspections have not detected any violations. ?????The proposal before the state Energy Commission would allow AES to=20 double its electricity output in Huntington Beach from 500 megawatts to 1,0= 00=20 megawatts. ?????The company's two 40-year-old units represent about 10% of the 5,000= =20 additional megawatts Davis has promised to meet an expected energy shortfal= l=20 this summer. ?????Despite the fast-tracking process, the company has vowed that it would= =20 safeguard against environmental damage and remedy any problems from plant= =20 operations. ?????If the plant is identified as drawing bacteria back to shore, AES woul= d=20 have to pay the costs deemed necessary to fix problems. ?????This is little consolation to residents, who would prefer a full=20 environmental review.

Gray Davis on energy issues=20 Gov. Gray Davis visited the Mercury News editorial board Monday. On the=20 subject of electricity, Davis talked about increasing the number of power= =20 plants, the rejection of price caps by the Federal Energy Regulatory=20 Commission, and the condition of the state's two largest utilities, Souther= n=20 California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. Davis has proposed a deal to= =20 rescue Edison, and the Legislature is considering it. PG&E has filed for=20 bankruptcy.=20 Here is a condensed version of Davis' remarks.=20 Q: What would you like to say by way of introduction about the state's=20 electricity problems?=20 Davis: There are really two problems. One is the amount of power available= =20 and the other is the price of power.=20 In 2002, we'll have more megawatts on line, at least 5,000 more. By 2003,= =20 we'll have a slight excess of power over demand. That's very important.=20 Because at the moment, we import 20 percent of our power. We have no=20 leverage. We are at the mercy of forces that show no mercy. That will never= =20 change until we have more power than we need.=20 OK, price. As you know, the only entity that can influence the [wholesale]= =20 price of electricity is the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.=20 Deregulation surrendered the ability of the state to do that.=20 In 1999, this state for all power, including municipal power, spent roughly= =20 $7 billion. In 2000, we spent $32.5 billion. I don't know what it will be= =20 this year, but it will be substantially higher.=20 Through all this the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has refused to do= a=20 thing, zero, zippo. Lest you think I'm being partisan, that commission=20 consists entirely of Clinton appointees.=20 The final piece is the financial consequences of what's happened to date. I= t=20 is our hope that if we can keep Southern California Edison credit-worthy an= d=20 able to re-enter the power purchasing market Jan. 1, 2003, we can then go t= o=20 the PG&E creditors committee [the generators to whom PG&E owes money] and s= ay=20 to them: ``Look at the arrangement we made with Southern California Edison.= =20 We believe that this is a far better deal than PG&E can give you.''=20 I think this is a fair plan. We get every electron that Edison's utility ow= ns=20 committed for 10 years, at a cost-of-service basis. Under [current law] the= y=20 could sell that next March at market rates. We got $400 million returned fr= om=20 the holding company, a $3 billion investment in the transmission and delive= ry=20 systems .?.?. a permanent easement on about 20,000 acres of environmental= =20 property around all their hydro facilities.=20 Q: Do you have in mind a finished product for the changes that are happenin= g=20 in the electric system? What will it look like in a couple of years?=20 Davis: It is my expectation that the utilities will be purchasing the power= =20 entirely, commencing Jan. 1, 2003. Our goal is to get them back in business= .=20 In addition to investor-owned utilities, I believe we also need a public=20 power authority. At some point I believe the private sector will say to=20 itself, ``I want to build new plants to replace the 40-year-old plants, but= =20 do I really want to get the state to a 15 percent margin over supply, there= by=20 reducing the value of the electrons I already own?'' If they do, God bless= =20 them. But if they don't, at least we'll have the opportunity to build them= =20 ourselves.=20 Once we have even a slight margin of capacity over demand, the spot market= =20 prices will come down dramatically.=20 Q: You said in February that you could have solved the electricity problem = in=20 20 minutes if you'd been willing to raise rates. Now, rates are going to be= =20 raised. Should you have favored a rate increase earlier?=20 Davis: I should have been more specific. I should have said I could have=20 solved it in 20 minutes if I wanted to triple rates. I think the rate=20 increase I proposed is fair. It rewards people who are the most energy=20 efficient, the people who only use up to 130 percent of their baseline. The= y=20 are approximately half the state. So half the state will see no rate=20 increase, beyond the 10 percent that everyone saw in January.=20 Q: Is the state willing to spend anything it costs to keep the lights on, o= r=20 at some point, would it stiff the generators and just say we will accept a= =20 blackout?=20 Davis: We have to provide power. There are many people who have medical=20 devices that have to keep running. Blackouts can cause deaths, traffic=20 accidents, all kinds of calamities that I wouldn't want to happen.=20 I'm reluctant to tell the generators we'll pay any price, so I'm not going = to=20 say we'll pay absolutely any price, but my bias obviously is to find a way = to=20 keep the lights on.=20 Q: When will you reveal how much electricity the state has bought, from wha= t=20 companies, at what prices and what this will cost the state this year and i= n=20 coming years?=20 Davis: We'll reveal an awful lot of information as soon as the bonds go to= =20 market. [The state plans a bond issue to cover the upfront costs of=20 purchasing electricity.] That information has to be made public. That will= =20 probably be in less than two months.=20 Believe me, I don't like going around getting beat up for hiding informatio= n.=20 I'm doing it for one reason only, which is that I know every additional edg= e=20 I give the generators will result in higher prices for customers.=20 Q: There's an impression that the state budget is being drained by the powe= r=20 crisis. Is that right?=20 Davis: The simple answer to that is no, because the state will be fully=20 reimbursed with interest as soon as these bonds are sold.=20 At the moment, in the short term, it is crowding out other spending. But I= =20 think everyone understands that's a temporary phenomenon, until the state i= s=20 reimbursed by bonds that are repaid over time through the rate structure th= at=20 I proposed.=20 Q: Would it be your pledge that ratepayers, not taxpayers, will fully repay= =20 the state's cost in purchasing electricity?=20 Davis: That is the assumption underlying these bonds. That's right as it=20 relates to electricity, but obviously the conservation incentives came out = of=20 the general fund.=20 Q: Have you talked to President Bush about this?=20 Davis: I hear all these rumors as to why the Bush administration doesn't wa= nt=20 to be helpful, but this state, and particularly this region, has been=20 disproportionately helpful in America's economic growth and technological= =20 productivity. If he wants America to grow, it behooves him to keep Californ= ia=20 growing.

""The implications for the development of competitive energy markets go far beyond the Western United States,"" Andersen's national utility practice head Matthew D. Smith told a Washington briefing. ""Unfortunately, California has taught the nation that regulatory and political barriers can create and sustain an energy crisis."" ""California has demonstrated that the risks in the electricity industry, if not properly acknowledged and managed, can simultaneously and profoundly impact all market participants. To be effectively managed, these risks need to be exposed, assumed or shared, measured and monitored. When they are hidden or ignored, all parties can potentially suffer. A shared, integrated view of these risks, and a strategy for their assumption and management, is critical to avoiding rapid value destruction within the energy market,"" Smith said. An Andersen survey of senior utility executives outside California, also released at the briefing, indicates most utility companies believe they inoculated themselves against the California virus so that it is unlikely to affect their operations beyond slowing the pace of deregulation and increasing investor scrutiny. However, based on the potential implications it sees of the California situation, Andersen believes a series of booster shots are advisable for power companies and regulators. ""To deliver reliable service at a predictable cost in today's environment, companies must focus on market integration by developing new and innovative relationships between suppliers, customers, employees and investors -- while working with government officials and regulators to chart a smoother transition to a deregulated power market,"" according to Smith. Eight Implications The Andersen report identified eight overriding implications emanating from the Western energy crisis that are shaping the longer-term operations of the Western grid, the regional and national economy, domestic energy policy and the industry's evolution: 1. Increased deregulation uncertainty and risk -- Tension and differences between state and federal regulators raise the specter of repeating the regulatory and political conundrum California's investor-owned utilities have faced. If federal initiatives open wholesale markets while retail markets remain regulated, a crucial question is raised: Will state regulators pass-through higher wholesale costs if they should materialize? Tensions between state and federal regulators over policies on deregulation will grow if states delay or abandon retail competition. As wholesale markets are deregulated and RTOs begin operating, the prudence principles that state regulators have used for many years may have to be changed. For example, if FERC and RTO monitors determine that deregulated wholesale markets operate fairly, prices derived from those markets must be considered reasonable. If so, these costs should be allowed into state-regulated retail rates without regard to the prudence principles state regulators have used for years. Therefore, utilities' traditional burden of proving costs are or are not justifiable shifts to regulators. 2. Reduced investor confidence -- Prior to deregulation, stringent prudence review and disallowance of generation costs in the rate base made regulatory risk largely uncontrollable, killing IOU interests in most new investment. A major purpose of deregulation was to create an environment in which risk could be managed, but California's political and regulatory environment provides only a limited ability to manage risks. The confidence and perceptions needed to support investment decision-making will be slow to return given the approach of the state to remedy the crisis. 3. Contributing factor in economic softening -- Uncertain energy reliability and higher costs can drive-out marginal businesses, cause healthy companies to constrain expansion, and lead new entrants to question whether to make new investments. As such, an extended energy crisis contributes to inflation pressures and may slow economic growth. 4. Increased pressure on the Western grid -- Even as capacity increases and demand reductions work to resolve the California crisis, these solutions have long-term implications for the Western Grid. These include a realistic possibility of California becoming an ""energy island"" as a result of near-term reduction in available regional resources for export to California; increased emphasis on security control to protect against overall Western grid failure as sub-regions have problems; RTO requirements to strengthen locally available supplies to bolster overall system reliability; longer-term development of new plants using plentiful coal resources and clean coal technology will alter the pattern of imports into California; and the emergence of Mexico as a major supplier to southern California and Arizona, contributing to a bifurcation of the Western Grid into northern and southern markets. 5. Unbundling failures that push companies back to portfolio strategies -- For California investor-owned utilities, unbundling has achieved neither the least-cost solution sought by regulators nor value maximization targeted by investors. This necessitates a reevaluation of portfolio management strategies potentially involving generation, transmission, power trading and marketing, and retail businesses in multiple geographies serving multiple markets. 6. Ineffectiveness in changing siting and development restrictions -- California's retail price caps and multiple explanations for the crisis have left accelerated siting processes and environmental standards changes open to challenge by various interests. In addition, limiting application of new siting orders only to small generators contributes to uncertainty and investor hesitancy. 7. Procurement management that alters user-utility negotiating leverage -- Competitive markets compel participants -- suppliers, marketers, large industrial buyers, etc. -- to strategically manage procurement as a critical value-driver. Because risk is explicitly shared and always has the potential of shifting advantage to either seller or buyer, the sophistication of negotiations and contracts increases as competitive markets evolve. 8. Increased emphasis on distributed generation and new technologies -- California's reliability and price challenges have triggered a re-emergence of energy crisis measures from the 1970s. End-users are investing in solutions they control, and the distributed generation market is being aggressively developed among large retailers, industrial users and residential customers. This makes possible the development of microgrids connecting consumers in local areas and related changes in traditional grid systems, from modifications in interconnection agreements to changing definitions of reserve margins and system reliability. Industry Executives' Response Senior executives from sixteen non-California utilities with a combined market capitalization over $120 billion and $145 billion in revenues responded to an Andersen survey with their views of the implications of the California power crisis for their companies and for the industry. The survey, conducted between February 19, 2001 and March 2, 2001 by Knowledge Systems &amp; Research, Inc. of Syracuse, found that the companies are observing the California situation carefully, expect a slowing -- but not a turnaround -- of deregulation, and believe their internal plans and preparations are on-target for the changing environment: -- Deregulation -- Nearly all executives believe recent California events will slow the pace of deregulation over the next five years for states that have not begun or finished writing restructuring legislation. None believe that it will cause advanced states to re-regulate markets, although many states will review their legislation to assess their risk of duplicating California's current situation and make any changes necessary to avoid it. -- National legislation -- Few executives suggest the situation will initiate national energy policy/legislation; others believe it will be a continuing issue but, because of state-to-state variances, Congress will be unable to pass any comprehensive measures or force states to a restructuring timeline. Some expect additional state-level legislation. -- Company strategies -- Most do not see any changes to their business models or strategies for generation, distribution or supply procurement as a response to the situation in California. However, many have expanded their risk management programs, reduced spot market purchases, begun emphasizing long-term supply contracts, planning new power generation capacity, and started hedging with futures trades. Those facing price caps are rethinking their stance on them. -- Investor scrutiny -- Many executives indicate their shareholders are aware of the situation and investors -- particularly institutional investors -- are more heavily scrutinizing their actions. Many say news coverage has prompted retail, commercial and industrial customer skepticism of industry restructuring. -- Transmission deregulation -- Many executives agree the California situation will increase interest in FERC's regional transmission organizations (RTO) deregulation effort. Utility Company Action Items Both to guard against a sudden California cascade and as a potentially powerful competitive thrust, forward-thinking utilities should bolster their basic preparedness with a variety of tactics -- or inoculations -- specifically aimed to combat a potential California power virus, according to Andersen partner Mark Moskovitz: -- Improve procurement management and risk management capabilities -- To manage exposure to volatile supply and demand shifts, organizations must be sure that comprehensive and clear supply procedures, controls, decision points, risk limits and communications are in place. -- Plan and design innovative rate and pricing structures -- Companies and regulators must focus on communicating price signals that create value for both the customer and the provider. Innovative rate and pricing structures that more closely tie the customer's price to the real cost of supply will better signal the value of the service as well as providing more accurate information upon which both end user and supplier can make decisions. -- Increase emphasis on demand side management (DSM) strategies -- In addition to new pricing strategies to help achieve and maintain supply-demand equilibrium, companies must now focus on employing more extensive and innovative demand side management programs. These programs may offer significant benefits with limited risk to both the customer and energy supplier. -- Assess the supply and generation dynamics in adjacent jurisdictions -- Companies must take a broader view -- beyond typical geographic market definitions -- of the economics of generation and related business decisions in an increasingly volatile market in which supply will follow the best prices. -- Develop contingency plans for the continued deferral of new generation capacity -- In the face of potential ongoing generation capacity shortages, companies and regulators must be prepared to move with a portfolio of strategies to meet demand, including for example DSM, flexible pricing and distributed generation. In addition, they should explore efficiency-improving upgrades to existing facilities and seize any opportunity to accelerate near-term construction plans. -- Proactively address potential organizational disruption -- As regulatory and economic changes continue to churn the industry waters and companies adjust and/or restructure, they must be highly cogniscent of, sensitive to, and directly address employees' concerns with information about the company's future and theirs'. Industry/Regulatory Lessons There are also a number of broad primary lessons the electric power industry -- nationally and internationally -- should take away from its first major domestic test case in deregulation and restructuring, according to Andersen principal David O. Jermain: -- Simplify market design. -- Build a continuing role for regulators. -- Maintain communications with multiple constituent interests. -- Prepare contingency plans for extreme stress conditions. -- Couple real-time retail pricing with transparently priced wholesale competition. -- Provide special incentives for RTO investment, formation and development. -- Break down regulatory and political barriers to market signals and responses.

The first warm spell of the season is expected to cause temperatures to jump 10 degrees, leading to a 2,000 megawatt increase in electricity consumption -- the equivalent of two large power plants. The week started out with a peak demand of 28,835 megawatts, but by tomorrow it is forecasted to top 30,500 megawatts. This comes as hydroelectricity resources (both Northwest and California) run low, more than 10,000 megawatts of power plants remain off line due to planned and unplanned maintenance, and some 3,000 megawatts of Qualifying Facilities or alternative energy suppliers are not operating. The California ISO's renewed call for conservation precedes a forecast of 90 degree highs in the inland areas that may tempt many Californians to flip on air conditioners. For conservation tips -- such as using fans instead of air conditioners, setting thermostat at 78 degrees, etc. -- please see the California ISO's web site www.caiso.com. New Notification System: With a challenging summer around the corner, the California ISO wants to do all it can to bring information to the public as quickly as possible. For that reason, a new notification system is being brought on line. Media and the public can now access the Internet to keep current if rotating blackouts are issued. Navigation: Visit www.caiso.com Click on System Conditions for current information on rotating outages (will appear only when activated) For previous outage information (last hour, etc.), click on Market Notices, scroll to bottom of page and click on Notice Log The California ISO is also testing a new service to notify newsrooms immediately by email should the ISO initiate electrical emergencies (Stage One - Three) or rotating outages. If you would like to participate, please email kwerst@caiso.com with a maximum of one email address per newsroom. Additionally, a single on-call media pager number has been established: 916/815-0679. To make it easier on media, ISO Communications will no longer be posting on-call schedules for media spokespersons on the web site. Simply call the on-call pager after hours. News releases alerting the media to electrical emergencies will continue, as will news conferences held on-site in Folsom and via telephone. As a reminder, if you wish to visit the ISO control rooms (in Folsom or Alhambra) always call ISO Communications first at 888/516-NEWS to make an appointment. Access to the control rooms may be limited on certain days, depending on system conditions and/or level of requests from media.

Hi Steve -

I won't be able to make the call on Monday.

I'd be happy to volunteer not to be on the negotiating team.  It sounds
like there's no shortage of people who want to be on the committee.

My big issue is default service.  This industry needs real customers and
the only way to get real customers is to get rid of default service. 
Starting with big customers, along the lines of the core/non-core gas
model, is the best way to go.  The only way to sell this, however, is to
get the big customers to agree it's a good idea.

Attached are suggested comments on the draft NERC bill for which we were asked to provide comments by today.  You will see that the response is a firm, but polite -- no thanks.  While I doubt NERC assumes that silence means support by their deadline today, I would like to get something to them by COB if at all possible.  (I will be on vacation tomorrow in any event).  With apologies for the short turn around, please call or e-mail your comments or OK this afternoon.

2.    Sales Practices -- this training has been completed in Portland and is

Lorraine, here are a few notes from my review of the Val Verde contract, and 
my initial impressions.  Let's talk more about how to approach the issue 
after we meet with Ron tomorrow about MAOP.

12/31/92 Interconnect Agreement:

Sec. 1.3 specifies pressures and states that unless there is an agreement to 
provide firm compression service TW will accept up to 200,000 on an 
interruptible basis.

Sec. 2 states that the Blanco Hub MAOP shall not be exceeded.

Sec. 4.2 limits damages (no consequential damages).

The contract also has a fairly standard force majeure clause.

2/18/93 letter amendment:

Sec. 3 obligates TW to provide firm compression service in order to accept 
200,000 into TW's system (provided MOGI has pressure of at least 650 and 
quantity of at least 140).  Acknowledges that this is an agreement to provide 
firm compression in accordance with Sec. 1.3 of 12/92 agreement.

9/25/95 letter amendment:

Increases quantity to be received at the interconnect to 250,000 once the San 
Juan expansion is effective.

My initial conclusions:  It is pretty clear we have an obligation to accept 
250,000 on a firm basis, provided that Burlington complies with the pressure 
requirements.  Probably the only way we can avoid this obligation is if 
accepting 250,000 would cause us to exceed the hub MAOP.  In that case we can 
argue impossibility of performance.  Also, we could avoid the obligation 
because the summer heat above certain temperatures constitutes force 
majeure.  This argument is strengthened by the fact that temperatures seem to 
have gotten hotter over the years.  

The fact that we entered into our most recent agreement with Burlington in 
January of this year weakens the credibility of our arguments (they will say 
we should have known by now).  Burlington might try to argue that we have an 
absolute obligation to comply with the agreement, even if it means expensive 
system modifications.  That argument is not a very strong one because the 
agreement contains no such affirmative obligation and in fact quite clearly 
describes the facilities that are the subject of the agreement.","Burlington: PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION. Lorraine, here are a few notes from my review of the Val Verde contract, and my initial impressions. Let's talk more about how to approach the issue after we meet with Ron tomorrow about MAOP. 12/31/92 Interconnect Agreement: Sec. 1.3 specifies pressures and states that unless there is an agreement to provide firm compression service TW will accept up to 200,000 on an interruptible basis. Sec. 2 states that the Blanco Hub MAOP shall not be exceeded. Sec. 4.2 limits damages (no consequential damages). The contract also has a fairly standard force majeure clause. 2/18/93 letter amendment: Sec. 3 obligates TW to provide firm compression service in order to accept 200,000 into TW's system (provided MOGI has pressure of at least 650 and quantity of at least 140). Acknowledges that this is an agreement to provide firm compression in accordance with Sec. 1.3 of 12/92 agreement. 9/25/95 letter amendment: Increases quantity to be received at the interconnect to 250,000 once the San Juan expansion is effective.

Steve -

I enjoyed our meeting last Monday and we are hard at work on a different
proposal designed to speed up or progress to the top ranks of the world's
best business schools. As you pointed out this is in our mutual interest as
well as the interests of much of the Houston business community.

I mentioned in our meeting the possibility of your joining the Council of
Overseers of the Jones School. This group consists of about 36 business
leaders, mostly from Houston but also includes individuals from as far away
as Saudi Arabia.

We meet about two times a year for an afternoon to discuss important policy
issues facing the Business School. I have found the advice and counsel
offered by the group to be extraordinarily helpful as we work on improving
the Jones School. The group is chaired by Dennis Hendrix, former CEO of
PanEnergy. I will fax you a list of the members and the charter of the group.

It so happens that we will be meeting next Wednesday afternoon from three
to five PM at Cohen House, the faculty club at Rice University and you
would be welcome to attend either as a new member or as a guest.
Interestingly, a presentation will be given by a group of faculty who have
interests in the area of e-commerce.

I will have my assistant fax this material to you shortly. Should you wish
to discuss this, I will be here all afternoon today as well as all of next
week.

Attached is the proposed press release, which includes input from Rebecca, 
Cole and Neil.  We are tentatively planning to issue the release Monday , 
October 11, but in case word leaks to the media from Cole's meetings with 
local landowners starting tomorrow, we may need to issue this week.  With 
that in mind, would you please provide me any comments on the attached 
document by the end of the day tomorrow, October 6.

Please note that this project has received tremendous local resistance to 
date, so we are quoting Cole and adding much more information about the local 
benefits to try to address these issues.  We are drafting a Q&A document and 
key message points for use with local and national media and the investor 
audience.

I would not go so far as to say we are pushing for PJM's implementation, however, but for a market with nodal prices (and unilateral bids - aka unbalanced schedules, congestion reflect by price differentials, etc).  I was unaware PJM had such great power to alter bids.  This is something we don't want, and something for which I am not aware we have advocated.  Perhaps in Enron's promotion of locational prices, it has been retold as PJM-style locational prices.  Given that PJM is the most commonly cited example of locational prices, it does not surprise me to have the sloppiness in discussions that could lead to the rumors.

	Vince,

	  I've been hearing rumors that Enron has decided to endorse
	the nodal pricing model as implemented in PJM.
	I just wanted to warn you that I'm not sure
	this is in Enron's long-term interest at all.  Let me explain
	why.  Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to talk
	more about this.

	  First, let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing
	and specifically pricing congestion.  However, the way that PJM
	implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility
	and reduce the transparency of the market.  Specifically, the
	PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a
	%10 adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems
	is out of merit in one of the three zones in region.  (The fact
	that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm.)
	Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and re-runs its price-setting
	software to compute new nodal prices.  The way I have (somewhat
	unfairly) decribed this price-setting process is that the
	PJM ISO decides what prices it would like
	for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them.  This is not
	a transparent market, nor one where it makes any sense to buy
	the risk management services that Enron provides.  The
	only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is
	that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area
	to meet demand.  Under these circumstances, you need to pay the
	imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market.

	  However, bear in mind FERC's desire to make a large RTO on the
	East Coast.  This will effectively mean little imports
	to the East Coast RTO, so all bids can be mitigated at
	the discretion of the ISO.  Paying market-clearing prices to cost-of-service
	mitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility.
	It effectively kills off the development of risk management at
	the wholesale and retail level.  Power marketing becomes much less
	profitable because retailers know you can always buy at cost-mitigated
	prices.

	  In short, the PJM model is not market.  It is just an alternative
	form of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces
	price volatility, but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just
	get a higher cost form of regulation than traditional cost-of-service
	regulation. You pay market-clearing prices to cost-of-service
	mitigated bids, but under regulation you could just pay cost-of-service
	prices and eliminate the infra-marginal profits to low cost generators.

	  As we discussed during our dinner, I think the two biggest sources
	of benefits from re-structuring will come from getting the demand-side
	involved in the market and from more efficient risk management.  A
	necessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect
	actual conditions in the market (including the extent of market power
	exercised).  Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market
	participants to make the investment necessary to management.  The PJM
	model is just way to have a market in name without achieving any
	significant benefits to consumers or energy traders.

		 Subject: Update Day 1 Second Session FERC CA Settlement

In the Room

Conference attended by all in-state generators, a few munies, the IOUs and a 
few others. One attorney from CPUC, but on phone. Barbara Barkovich attended 
for CA Large Consumers.  Nader sent someone.  No other consumers.  One other 
ESP -- Strategic Energy (only operates in San Diego).
Judge reports that only 6 offers have been submitted to FERC for sales to the 
IOUs (note; Enron submitted one of the offers). The offers total 2000 MW. The 
prices are quite divergent.  He expresses concern at the little offered.
Generators suggest that more could be offered if FERC could be more flexible 
on terms (FERC required 24/7 offers).
IOUs and others press judge to seek offers from others not present (e.g., 
BPA, other marketers, SW utilities), but judge does not offer to do so.
Barkovich says can't throw large customers into non-core market now.
Everyone agrees that we are all looking for a blended wholesale rate (part 
existing gen, part OFs, part forward contract and part spot) that meshes with 
the IOUs' ability to recover the costs in rates -- so tied to CPUC rate 
increase.
Discussion of CPUC PD -- not enough
Enron able to take low profile.
SDG&E suggested terminating the settlement talks at FERC, saying nothing 
could be achieved.
Not much happens until 4:30 pm, when judge blows up -- judge directed 
epithets at SDG&E and SCE.  SCE had refused to cooperate from the beginning.  

Out of the Room

Separate talks between PG&E and SDG&E and some of the generators.
Late in the day, Judge meets with IOUs.
Parties agree informally that forum does not work well given lack of CPUC 
involvement, but some believe that FERC is only hope for a workable 
resolution.

Next Steps -- The Judge Speaks

Judge asked everyone to consider how to ""Share the Pain"" for Thursday's 
meeting and said not to expect any ""win:win"" scenario. His view is that FERC 
is better than the CA legislature or bankruptcy court.
His focus will be on Wolak proposal to share the pain, as submitted in 
12/1/00 comments to FERC -- forces all sellers to CA to sell most of its 
supply (either generation or marketer offers) as cost-based rates in forward 
contracts, or lose ability to sell at market-based rates.  Generators oppose 
this, I believe.

Hi Steve, 
    Folks love Newsome, and I think he's very nice and appears to be very 
free market.  Spears, the other Republican appointee is not at all free 
market, in my view.  I would not like this to mentioned anywhere else, but I 
have found that the farm reps on the Commission may sound deregulatory but 
are not, and have been really troublesome without a good free market person 
on board.  And there are no truly free market persons on  board at the 
Commission (every single other agricultural rep that I worked with on the 
Commission were trouble, even though they claimed to be deregulatory -- and 
they were far worse before I got there and after I left.)  
    I visited with Newsome a day before Inauguration, and I was appalled at 
what they were planning to do concerning agency structure -- that would have 
elevated the regulatory lawyers and diminished the role of the economists at 
the agency.  Misguided and showed to me a lack of understanding of how 
organizational structures can affect what comes out of an agency.  
    I am often at odds with ""the industry view"" regarding CFTC issues.  I 
don't think the futures exchanges, who have a lot of power, necessarily are 
pro-competition; and many of the non-exchange folks who lobby on CFTC issues 
are Washington or New York (Democrat - which is why they want to involve Ken 
at this level) lawyers who do not understand markets and who are more 
interested in being able to claim influence or impact.  The CFTC is in awful 
shape -- the quality of staff is horrendous, and the Commission is relying on 
some of the worst people for their policy work (same folks that Brooksley 
Born used, same folks who have advocated more regulation of the OTC market 
for years).  Many quality folks do not want the job as Chairman because it's 
been such a backwater.  I am looking for some good folks.  Have  at least one 
person who would be good at that job.  And it's not Newsome.  Please do not 
share this information with the usual folks, as they hate me anyway (I'm too 
free market and have argued against their ""fixes"").  Sorry for this scathing 
review, but this is an important appointment.  Wendy

I got a voicemail fro Ken.  He would be happy to meet with Freeman.  He is 
willing to work on other times, but suggested the following
After 3:00 on May 2nd (right after Ken's speech to the RGA) or late the day 
before or in the morning of the second (to do this though he would have to 
cancel his speech to the Texas Governor's business council but he is willing 
to do this if necessary)
His least preferred alternative in this general time frame would be early 
morning on the third.

Nice job!  Can you imagine the ""fun"" someone is going to have if a Region,
say SPP, MAIN, MAPP, WSCC, or FRCC, has a major blackout this summer and the
""loyal opposition"" ""discovers"" that said region has refused to sign an
agreement such as this and not implemented the program required by the
agreement.  That may even constitute ""willful neglect.""  Wouldn't it be even
worst if the ""discovery"" showed that the region was not signed because the
region wanted to use it's position as a bargaining ploy? (SPP, FRCC, and
WSCC) Oh no, I sound like a wantabe lawyer!

Subject: Compliance Agreement


Regional Managers
Compliance Task Force

As we discussed on the conference call on Friday, I have prepared a simple
draft letter of intent for the use of those regions who wish to indicate
support for the regional compliance and enforcement program, but are not
yet in a position to sign the Agreement for Regional Compliance and
Enforcement Programs that the NERC Board of Trustees approved on February
13.

For the benefit of those who were not on the call, I'd like to recap where
things stand at this point.  My apologies if I mischaracterize anyone's
position.  NPCC and ERCOT have signed the agreement.  ECAR has stated it
will sign the agreement at the signing ceremony on March 30.  SPP is
prepared to sign the agreement, but doesn't want to be the only one it its
part of the Eastern Interconnection to do so.  FRCC was not on the call,
but has previously stated that it is prepared to sign so long as at least
six regions sign.  MAPP and MAIN have indicated that they prefer to develop
their program with their own members before they sign the NERC
agreement.  WSCC may need to consider the matter at its Board meeting in
early April.  SERC has the matter under consideration.  I have not heard
from MAAC, but it has a meeting scheduling for March 29.

I want to share with you my concern for the climate in Washington.  In the
past few weeks I have had occasion to speak with a number of people on
Capitol Hill and in the new Administration.  All are very concerned about
what might happen this summer.  If a serious incident occurs, I am quite
sure that Congress will legislate very quickly--whether it will legislate
wisely is a different question.  We have the opportunity with this
agreement for the industry to take charge of its own destiny.  If Congress
acts it may well assign a very central role to the Federal government to
take direct responsibility for reliability.  There are those in the
Department of Energy who are pushing for such a role.   Congressman Barton
is talking of the possibility of emergency legislation, possibly within the
next few weeks.  If the industry pulls together, I believe we can forestall
direct governmental controls, just as in 1965.  If the industry does not
step up, then Congress may well assign the responsibility elsewhere.

The CTG recommended to the Board that a critical mass of six Regions sign
onto the agreement before it goes forward.  For those Regions that are
considering developing their own programs with their members before they
sign the agreement, with the view of having the CAPG determine in advance
whether their programs meets the requirements of the agreement, I ask you
to consider this:  If we don't get a critical mass of Regions to sign, then
the CAPG may not come into existence.

The NERC/Regions agreement is really an undertaking by the regions to work
to develop their own regional compliance and enforcement program with their
members.  My request remains that each of the regions sign the agreement by
the March 30 Board meeting.  That will assure that we are able to make the
governance changes that we have all been working for.  If any region is
unable to sign by March 30, then use of the letter of intent would be a way
to demonstrate support for the program.  That may be enough to satisfy
those who have stated that moving forward on the compliance program is a
condition to their support of the governance changes.

Thanks very much for your consideration of the program and all the work
you've put into this transition so far.  Please let me know if you have
questions or if there is anything that we can do from here to be of
assistance to you.

Subject: RE: United India - strictly confidential and privileged  

I think Justin answered your question about governing law and the first  
arbitration hearing and I am going to find out from Atul about whether Indian 
law governs these policies since Indian law requires us to have an Indian 
fronting policy.  

On another issue that came up on the call this morning Ken, I was asking 
Justin about governing law specifically because I wanted to know if there was 
any law (India or English) requiring insurers to disclose information 
regarding risk to the insured, so we could cite some law perhaps to compel 
Beachcrofts to hand over the Liburdi report.   For example, the Texas 
insurance code has evolved from a vague ""duty of good faith & fair dealing"" 
standard in some instances to specific laws preventing insurers from doing 
certain things detrimental to the insured.  Justin tells me English law, in 
this regard, consists only of precedential case law, but it still could be 
helpful.  Because of the commercial risk (outside the ambit of arbitration in 
the instance) it might be worthwhile to consider going into the London 
Commercial Court to seek some sort of extraordinary relief to prevent United 
India from withholding this information which is critical to running these 
machines.   If, in fact,  there truly is a 50% chance of failure in these 
machines, yet they won't share that evidence with us, this is a commercial 
risk DPC can't afford, regardless of coverage and apart from the 
arbitration.  (I'm wearing my commercial hat instead of my legal hat today).  
Although Justin expressed concern about jurisdiction, United India did us the 
favor of bringing  suit in London Commercial Court earlier, and thus having 
availed itself to the courts and having Peter Hirst's emphatic witness 
statement that makes a compelling case for the court to take jurisdiction, I 
think it is worth considering  if they continue to refuse to give us the 
report in response to Justin's latest correspondence.  I don't think we can 
afford to sit on our hands on this one.  Why don't you and Neil kick this 
around, (since you don't have enough to do already).
Cheers,

  No wonder I couldn't remember the governing law!  Yes that is a good idea 
to determine which law is more favorable to our position.  Let's mention that 
to Ken tomorrow as we may want to have Atul Rajadhyaksha look at that for 
us.  I think originally we discussed that notion but its been a long time ago.

Subject: RE: United India - strictly confidential and privileged


Michelle,

I know the problem about cases and clauses running together!

The position on the insurance is that it does not specify a governing law.
On an application of English private international law (ie conflict of laws
rules) there is uncertainty whether it would be English or Indian law. At
para 42 of Hirst's statement, he says that the contracts are impliedly
subject to English law (based on London as the arbitration forum?).
Certainly, my preference in terms of certainty would be English law.
However, it is possible there could be an advantage to Indian substantive
law and once we get UI's statement of claim, we should give thought to
whether it would be worthwhile getting Indian law input on whether there
could be advantage in arguing Indian law. I will ask Diane to add this to
the ""to do"" list!

Justin

Looks good to me Justin.  Justin is there any law that governs an insurer's
duty to disclose information regarding the risk insured?  What law governs
the insurance contract? ( I should know that ,but all my cases and
arbitration clauses are beginning to run together in my mind...).

on quantum. It would be great if you were able to look through this today

Two documents:
First is the external document we faxed to certain reporters.
This is what Steve is referring to.


Second is the talking points which reflect all changes to date.
I am waiting legal approval - which I'm expecting any minute
(I emailed Mike Smith your changes last night).   



We should put both on website as soon as I track down Mike or Vicki. 

Thanks,
Peggy

You have to love the availability of beautiful lasses for viewing. Things are interesting. Enron is moving right along and we will find out about who I am working for on Friday (our auction should be completed then). Not too much else is new. My place continues to get better (as I slowly furnish it), but Portland continues to be the little sister to Seattle. A couple new bars in town suggest she might be getting closer to puberty but definitely not the woman about town that Seattle is. Morgan told me you may no longer be with Steph? Is this true? (And I hope you are the only one reading this if it is not). If that is the case, well, we can see what we can do about it. As always, I have no plans the next couple weekends, so give me a shout (still have my cell phone at 503-887-3449) if you want to take a trip on down. Your always welcome to crash on my couch...(sorry its all I have, I got rid of the futon). Hope youre doing well.

I enjoyed talking with you the other day and am happy to answer your 
questions:  both the Texas position and the Washington DC position report to 
Rick Shapiro.  From a government affairs standpoint, I've divided the world 
between Rick's group (the Americas) and Mark Schroeder's group (Europe and 
Asia).  Both Rick and Mark report to me.

Joe Allen continues as part of the Texas legislative team, working for the 
head of that group (formerly Kathleen Magruder).

Terry Thorn has taken a commercial position in Enron and no longer works on 
government affairs issues for the company (except to the extent we call on 
various executives to help from time-to-time).

Subject: Thanks & Questions

STEVE: I very much appreciate your call the day before yesterday and your
asking if I would like to compete to succeed Joe Hillings as head of Enron's
Washington office. Although until that moment I hadn't thought of returning
to Washington except to serve again in national office, I would be pleased
to talk further about this opportunity with you or your recruiter.

In recalling our conversation, I realize that twice you asked if I had any
questions, and if I had been quick to take advantage of your offer, I would
have asked how government relations are handled at Enron. To whom does Joe
Hillings report: to you or to Terry Thorne? You mentioned a woman who
currently has responsibility for government relations in Texas and some
neighboring states but is leaving for another job at Enron; to whom does she
report? Then there is Joe Allen, whom I have known since our days in the
Legislature; doesn't he (also) handle Texas affairs?

I am sorry I didn't ask you all this on Tuesday. Whatever the answers, it's
clear that government relations are  much more central to the work of Enron
than at Compaq, which is why it would be a very exciting place to work.
Thanks again for your call, your courtesy, and your indulgence with this
tardy line of questioning. With best wishes, CHASE.

HEADLINE: Southern Co., Regulators Clash in Power-Grid Fight 

BYLINE: By Matthew C. Quinn 

BODY: 
Southern Co. appears to be on the verge of losing a big-money power struggle over control of its four-state electricity transmission system. 

But both sides in the tug-of-war offer different takes on which result would help consumers and which would hurt them. 

At issue are long-distance transmission lines, mounted on huge steel towers, that carry electricity across state lines to towns and cities. Atlanta-based Southern Co. has invested $ 3 billion in its 26,000-mile system, but federal regulators want it to cede control to a larger agency that covers eight states. The matter is coming to a head now after three years of wrangling. 

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission wants to carve up the country into four regional transmission organizations, or RTOs, for the Southeast, Northeast, Midwest and West. Under such a plan, local utilities like Southern would be unable to stop competing power shipments from out-of-state suppliers. 

Regional transmission organizations ""yield significant customer savings,"" said FERC Chairman Pat Wood III. Commission spokeswoman Barbara Connors said lower rates will result when barriers to competitively priced electricity from outside the region are dropped and transmission costs reduced. 

But there are sharp differences of opinion on that score. 

Andy Dearman, Southern Co.'s chief transmission officer, cites estimates that a super-regional agency could cost more than $ 100 million to establish, and he says those costs could be passed on to consumers in the form of higher rates. According to Georgia Power Co., a Southern Co. subsidiary, transmission costs already account for about 6.5 percent of Georgia electricity bills. 

There's also a question of reliability when a new system is established, Dearman saud. ""It impacts the ability to keep the lights on,"" he said. 

Some state regulators, who stand to lose regulatory control, see a Washington power grab. 

""We've got low prices and a reliable system,"" said Georgia Public Service Commissioner Stan Wise, who sees a back-door move toward utility deregulation of the sort that has failed with electricity in California and been severely tested with natural gas in Georgia. 

""Don't tell me about the new system when I've got blood on my face from the last battle,"" Wise said. ""There are some parallels that make us squirm."" 

PSC Chairman Lauren ""Bubba"" McDonald wrote President Bush following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks urging a delay. ""This is not the time to consider or implement any change to the management of the nation's transmission grid,"" he said. 

But the federal commission has only toughened its position. 

Wood, a Texan recently named chairman by Bush, said last month he wants to use the commission's authorities as a ""stick"" to force reluctant utilities into line. Wood would deny utilities that refuse to join a ""new world"" of regional power grids by Dec. 15 the authority to charge deregulated prices and delay merger approvals for those firms. 

The commission plans a series of workshops in Washington next week for what Wood called the ""brightest minds available"" in the utility field to brainstorm over transmission reorganization plans. Southern Co. is sending a representative. 

Companies like Enron Corp., the Texas-based national energy suppler, are pressing for RTOs as the first step toward a national transmission grid -- a concept favored by the Bush administration. 

Prodded by federal regulators, Southern Co. in June agreed to dilute its control over the 26,000-mile system by joining with public power agencies in five states to form a larger, 39,000-mile transmission agency to be operated by an outside company. But a federal mediator rejected the plan. 

The issue has also split Southern Co. from onetime subsidiary Mirant Corp., an independent power company with plans to expand into the Southeast. 

Large regional grids are ""more cost-effective and reliable"" than the present territorial hodgepodge, said Mirant spokesman Buddy Eller. 

By encouraging development of new and cleaner power plants, the environment would benefit too, he added. 

But Wise called such predictions ""totally unproven.""

Subject: Re: Corporate Allocations April 2001  

I frankly don't see Enron Europe getting $12,000 per month value from 
""Environment"" nor ""Environmental policy and compliance"". I have raised with 
the Washington office why someone there is apparently following European 
environmental legislation and policy, when such things can only directly 
affect Enron Europe's business. I see that PR get hit with more than twice 
this amount to pay for our ""Chief Environmental Officer"". By copy I'm asking 
RIck Shapiro's view; we could obviously take the question up direct with 
Steve Kean.

Doug may wish to comment on the international project finance allocation, 
also from Washington.

We need to schedule a review with you of the May indicative expenditure 
report. Would late pm on 29th be convenient?

Below is the text of recommendations taken from the summary of 
recommendations in the Cheney Energy Report being released later this morning 
that focus on coal and coal-related issues, including environmental.

""The NEPD Group (National Energy Policy Development) recommends that the 
President direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) to propose multi-pollutant legislation.  The NEPD Group recommends that 
the President  direct the EPA Administrator to work with Congress to propose 
legislation that would establish a flexible, market-based program to 
significantly reduce and cap emissions fo sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, 
and mercury from electric power generators.  Such a program (with appropriate 
measures to address local concerns) would provide significant public health 
benefits even as we increase electricity supplies.

 Establish mandatory reduction targets to emissions of three main pollutants: 
sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury.

 Phase in reductions over a reasonable period of time, similar to the 
successful acid rain reduction program established by the 1990 amendments to
 the Clean Air Act.

 Provide regulatory certainty to allow utilities to make modifications to 
their plants without fear of new litigation.

 Provide market-based incentives, such as emissions trading credits to help 
achieve the required reductions.""

""The NEPD Group recognizes the importance of looking to technology to help us 
meet the goals of increasing electricity generation while protecting our 
environment.  To that end, the NEPD Group  recommends that the President 
direct the Department of Energy to continue to develop advanced clean coal 
technology by:

 Investing $2 billion over 10 years to fund research in clean coal 
technologies.

 Supporting a permanent extension of the existing research and development 
tax credit.

 Directing federal agencies to explore regulatory approaches that will 
encourage advancements in environmental technology.

""The NEPD Group recomemnds that the President direct federal agencies to 
provide greater regulatory certainty relating to coal electricity generation 
through clear policies that are easily applied to business decisions.""

""The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the Administrator of the 
Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy 
and other relevant agencies, to review New Source Review regulations, 
including administrative interpretations and implementation, and report to 
the President within 90 days on the impact of the regulations on investment 
in new utility and refinery generation capacity, energy efficiency, and 
environmental protection.""

""The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the Attorney General to 
review existing enforcement actions regarding New Source Review to ensure 
that the enforcement actions are consistent with the Clean Air Act and its 
regulations.""

""The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct federal agencies to 
support continued research into global climate change; continue efforts to 
identify environmentally and cost-effective ways to use market mechanisms and 
incentives; continue development of new technologies; and cooperate with 
allies, including through international processes, to develop technologies,

Subject: help with neighborhood

Steve,

I am having a problem with the drainage in our easements in my neighborhood 
and Kevin Hannon suggested I email you.  I live in Garden Oaks (which is 
located off of the 610 North Loop between Shepherd and Yale near the 
Heights).  Our neighborhood was built in the early 1940's, and the city put 
in open drainage (which is basically ditches in the front of all the 
properties).  Over the past 60 years the drains have filled in and leveled 
which is preventing the water from flowing correctly to the sewers, and this 
in turn causes minor flooding and BIG headaches.  

My address is 236 W. 30th Street and the area of 30th Street I am asking the 
city to regrade is between Ashland and Yale (approximately 2,500 feet).  I 
have been calling the City of Houston Public Works Department 713-247-1000 
for about the last 4 years (generally once a month) to ask them to please 
come out and regrade our ditches.  (The Public Works Department only has 
records over the last year because they changed their computer system and 
lost many files including mine.)  For the last year or so I have been 
receiving a more positive response when I call which is: ""This is a Code 1 
priority and will schedule as work load allows.""  Although this response is 
encouraging, I still feel that my request is falling on deaf ears.  

Kevin suggested that perhaps a call or letter to a city council person might 
help expedite this work request.  I would be extremely grateful if there is 
anything you could do to help me and my neighbors.

Steve, 

Sorry for the delay in tracking down this rumor on a potential ad campaign.
I left a message with Maureen this afternoon and subsequently talked with
Smith's staff person.  She said she was not aware of any ad campaign but she
would talk with the Senator about it when he is back on Monday. 

Have a good weekend and I will call you on Monday.

While the more-open gas market may have more tools available than in electric

The WSJ report of 8-23 on the power/price situation in Con Ed's territory 
contains the following: ""And the tools to hedge prices, such as those that 
exist in other commodities markets, aren't fully developed yet for th 
fledgling deregulated electricity industry.""
That might be worthy of comment in my talk. Anything I should see on the

Subject:	Monthly Billing - Detail Class 845 / s100105.xls

Year 2000 changes:
Phone charges:  Phones are being charged to the person's company and cost 
center where possible, otherwise rent as before.  The description will start 
with People\ or Room\ unless it was entered manually at the source.
Data connections:  One connection is being charged for each room instead of 
one connection for each port in a room.

Attached  are spreadsheets with the detail supporting the expenses for 
telephones, data ports, EDI, Enterprise LAN, Enterprise Help Desk, video 
conferencing, Internet access, email, and other services provided to Enron 
business units by Enron Information Services. 

EIS billings for items attached to the room, such as phones and data ports, 
and people specific services for contractors, such as LAN ID's and AT&T 
calling cards, are billed to the same company and cost center as room rent in 
EB or 3AC.  For Omaha, EIS uses a phone database maintained by Tammy Anderson 
for this purpose.  

People specific services for employees are billed to the company and cost 
center corresponding to the employee's HR company and department. Video 
conference usage, data circuits, Ardmore usage, EDI, and web site billings 
are based on a company and cost center furnished by the person requesting the 
service.

EIS bills services on a one month lag.  We take a snapshot of the Corporate 
Administrative Services rent file for each room in EB and 3AC, of the Omaha 
phone database for each room in Omaha, and of the HR company and department 
for each employee.  This snapshot is taken at the end of each month for use 
as a source for billing information.  

Please examine these billings for accuracy.  If our billings are incorrect, 
generally speaking either the rent should be corrected by contacting 
Corporate Administrative Services or the person should be moved to the 
correct HR department by contacting your HR representative.  If the room 
number is incorrect on the phone or long distance billings, this may be 
corrected by sending the room number along with the telephone number to Notes 
Mail ID ""Move-Team"".",Monthly Billing - Detail Class 845 / s100105.xls,4,Logistic Arrangements

Steve and Mark:  

I arrived in the US on Saturday with a good feeling about what appears to be 
a successful resolution of the Chorety crisis.  Under Steve Hopper's 
leadership, the Chorety spill became a non-issue by Friday.  During the 
crisis, I collaborated with my counterpart from Shell/London, Michael 
Megarry, in developing a Key Messages and Internal Q&As document (attached).  
At the daily meeting/conference call, there was an Operations Report from the 
site, an analysis of the day's newspaper articles (which I handled), and 
discussions on how to respond to media that were reporting or airing 
inaccurate information that was damaging Transredes' image.   

I also developed a Stakeholders Action Plan (attached) for the Incident 
Commander to use in organizing and monitoring team member actions taken in 
response to stakeholder concerns.  The Plan was updated daily by the 
Transredes PR Office and given to team members prior to every 
meeting/conference call.   The Stakeholder Report is intended to complement 
the Operations Report.  

I also want to acknowledge the support of Karen and Dennis during the early 
stages of the crisis.  It was extremely helpful.

Another agenda item

I got a call today from Bob Pease, Attorney with Market Oversight and Enforcement at FERC, 202-208-0131, to invite Enron to a meeting called by Chairman Wood at the CAISO offices on 24-25 Sep 01.  The purpose of the meeting is to try to get the FERC, CAISO, DWR and other market participants to work out issues related to reliability that have arisen in recent months.  Issues include those that that affect operations and reliability such as the must-offer requirements, ramping, etc.  He was not clear as to whether they would address creditworthiness issues.  From the FERC staff ""non-decisional"" employees will attend.  He invited solutions/proposals in advance of the meeting.  Enron needs to decide who to send.

Do we need to specifically rebut this?  Enron did file a study to support the natural markets of the SE, and, while we generally have stated responses to his issues in various forums, do we need to respond item by item?  (FYI--I have never heard the ""lake"" analogy before -- his characterization of it as the opponent position helps his case, but it is incorrect because as far as I know, there is no one proposing a system that ignores constraints).

Also, we have not focused much recently on the transmission pricing issues.  This may be an opportunity to discuss this in context.  He seems to use it as a reason against the Southeast RTO.

Below is a link to Southern Co. CEO Allen Franklin's prepared testimony at the Barton hearing last week (October 10).  He says they favor wholesale competition, but he then goes on to talk about the virtues of geographically smaller RTOs, with a phased approach of smaller RTOs that could later merge to become larger (although the Barton discussion draft would prevent such mergers).  The statement also chronicles their involvement in the Southeast mediation process.

In his oral testimony, Franklin kept ephasizing the lack of FERC cost/benefit studies on RTOs and the similar (alleged) lack of studies and analysis to support the 4 RTO model.

The statement also chronicles their involvement in the Southeast mediation process. In his oral testimony, Franklin kept ephasizing the lack of FERC cost/benefit studies on RTOs and the similar (alleged) lack of studies and analysis to support the 4 RTO model. -----Original Message----- From: Nersesian, Carin Sent: Monday, October 15, 2001 4:59 PM To: Shelk, John Subject: Southern Co.'s Testimony http://energycommerce.house.gov/107/hearings/10102001Hearing387/Franklin647.htm",1,"Company Business, Strategy, etc."

Following up on last night's e-mail, here are some specific suggestions to strengthen the draft EPSA letter on the Barton RTO draft.

The second paragraph and the first few bullets after it should be rewritten as follows to make it clear that the current legislative proposal on RTOs is far off the mark as opposed to being fixed by ""technical corrections"" as the draft letter now states:

You have identified RTOs as critical to the development of a well-functioning transmission system, and we wholeheartedly agree.  We commend you for including all transmission-owning utilities in the RTO provisions and for requiring that transmission be conducted on an open-access basis.  However, to accomplish the RTO and transmission goals we share, it is essential that any legislation on RTOs not slow down the process already underway at FERC.  Unfortunately, the discussion draft as issued on October 9th does not meet this test.  Specifically, the proposal

Establishes a lengthy and cumbersome process that will delay the formation of RTOs by imposing procedural requirements that advantage those who oppose properly functioning RTOs, including evidentiary hearings and court appeals review under standards of judicial review not normally applicable to Federal Power Act cases.  

Removes the ability of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to deal with an evolving marketplace by statutorily freezing market and operational structures in place as of date of enactment regardless of changed circumstances.

[rest of the bullets as in the draft letter]

We appreciate the opportunity to offer these suggestions to strengthen the draft letter.  Please call with any questions or comments before the Legislative Affairs Committee meeting tomorrow.  Thanks.

GOVERNOR DAVIS PRESSES FERC FOR ACTION ON WHOLESALE POWER RATES: Calls on
Federal Regulators to Reduce Prices, Issue Refunds

GOVERNOR DAVIS NAMES KAHN CHAIR OF THE GOVERNOR'S CLEAN ENERGY GREEN TEAM



OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 12, 2000

GOVERNOR DAVIS PRESSES FERC FOR ACTION ON WHOLESALE POWER RATES
Calls on Federal Regulators to Reduce Prices, Issue Refunds

SAN DIEGO - At a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) hearing today
in San Diego, Governor Gray Davis reiterated his call to federal regulators
to intervene ""to the fullest extent possible"" to lower electricity prices in
California.

""FERC bears responsibility to ensure that a workably competitive market
exists before California consumers and California's economy are subjected to
unconstrained, market-based electricity prices,"" said Governor Davis in a
statement read by Energy Oversight Board Chairman Michael Kahn.
""Consequently, I renew my prior request that the Commission act with utmost
speed to intervene to the fullest extent possible to restore wholesale
prices to fair levels and to remedy harms that have resulted from the
exercise of market power.""

Governor Davis noted that he and state lawmakers have taken dramatic action
in recent weeks to provide rate relief. ""While these actions should provide
short-term rate predictability and longer-term benefits to customers in
terms of improved supplies, the fundamental problem of exorbitant wholesale
prices still exists and remains the responsibility of FERC to address,"" said
the governor. ""No combination of state actions can substitute for federal
action to ameliorate the problems of California's wholesale markets.""

Governor Davis has taken the following actions in reaction to rising
electricity prices in San Diego:

On June 14, he called for emergency reduction of electricity use by all
state facilities in the San Francisco Bay area in response to electricity
emergency and rolling blackouts.

On June 15, he called on chairpersons of the Public Utilities Commission
(PUC) to analyze the conditions that led to electricity shortages in the San
Francisco Bay area the previous day, including a statewide perspective on
the price and delivery of electricity. Report was completed, submitted to
the governor and released on August 2.

On July 27, 2000, Governor Davis called on federal and state regulators to
take swift action to extend the caps on wholesale electric rates in
California and provide San Diego ratepayers with million of dollars in
refunds.

In letters written by the governor to two state regulatory agencies and two
California-based panels charged with overseeing California's power market,
he called for a coordinated state effort to urge federal regulators to take
strong measures to reduce power rates in both the short- and long-term.

On August 2, 2000, Governor Davis issued three Executive Orders designed to
reduce energy consumption by state government and speed up the time it takes
new power generating facilities to win approval from state agencies.

On August 9, 2000, Governor Davis called on the Public Utilities Commission
(PUC) to establish a two-year plan that would cut electricity rates by
nearly half for residential and business customers of San Diego Gas &
Electric.

The governor also reached an agreement with the California Grocers
Association that will save enough electricity to provide power to between
50,000 and 60,000 homes during periods of peak demand, as grocers agreed to
reduce power consumption by 10 percent during Stage One emergencies.

On August 10, 2000, Governor Davis wrote a letter to President Clinton
urging him to expedite FERC's investigation to determine whether current
electric rates in San Diego were unjust.

On August 22, 2000, Governor Davis called on President Clinton to release
emergency funds from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)
to the state to help low-income Californians pay their rapidly-rising
electricity bills.

On August 23, 2000, President Clinton responded to Governor Davis' request
by releasing $2.6 million in emergency funds to help low-income Southern
Californians cope with the surge in their electricity bills. The President
also asked federal regulators to speed up their investigation into the
operation of U.S. power markets and urged the Small Business Administration
to use its credit programs to help small firms hurt by the price increases.

On August 23, 2000, Governor Davis reached agreement with legislators on
legislation to provide relief to San Diego ratepayers. The governor signed
two bills into law on September 6, 2000.

Please see attached letter (below).

SEPTEMBER 12, 2000

STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS

TO THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION CONCERNING ITS INVESTIGATION OF
WHOLESALE PRICE ESCALATION IN CALIFORNIA

The Summer of 2000 has confronted California with an electricity crisis that
seriously threatens the safety, health and well being of citizens and
businesses throughout the state. At the heart of the crisis is the
extraordinary run up in prices for wholesale electric energy and ancillary
services, accompanied by deteriorating service and reliability. In San
Diego, electric customers' bills have more than doubled this summer,
threatening permanent harm to businesses and the health and welfare of
residential customers in the warm southern climate. All remaining California
electric consumers are faced with similar prospects as their legislated rate
freeze periods come to an end. In San Francisco we saw rolling blackouts for
the first time in our history.

As soon as the dimensions of the crisis became evident, I directed
California regulators, including the Public Utilities Commission and the
Electricity Oversight Board, and the Independent System Operator, to take
immediate steps to identify and implement specific measures to mitigate the
damage, including restoring price caps at Summer 1999 levels. I am happy to
report that those measures have been adopted, although not without
considerable resistance from self-interested parties.

In recent weeks, I have worked with the California Legislature to enact
further relief within the existing framework of options now available to the
state. These include provisions to stabilize retail rates, expedite
generation licensing where possible, implement targeted demand reduction and
demand response and remove constraints in transmission and distribution
systems. I have also established a task force comprised of key state
officials which is developing measures to increase energy efficiency and
alternative supplies and to expedite permitting by state agencies.

While these actions should provide short-term rate predictability and
longer-term benefits to customers in terms of improved supplies, the
fundamental problem of exorbitant wholesale prices still exists and remains
the responsibility of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to address.
No combination of state actions can substitute for federal action to
ameliorate the problems in California's wholesale markets.

A joint report submitted to me on August 2nd by the Chairman of the
California Electricity Oversight Board and the President of the California
Public Utilities Commission concluded that exorbitant wholesale prices in
California result from wholesale market dysfunction and the exercise of
market power by sellers. Subsequent reports by the Market Analysis
Department and the Market Surveillance Committee of the California
Independent System Operator reach the same conclusions. Subsequent behavior
of wholesale electric prices during August confirms their conclusions, and
subjects California to further economic damage. While I remain hopeful that
California wholesale markets may ultimately become competitive and become
capable of serving the interests of consumers and the public, I cannot and
will not accept the liabilities to California that result from the current
situation for even a short period. I intend to take any and all steps
necessary to restore economic stability to the electric service
infrastructure of California.

FERC bears the responsibility under its organic act to assure just and
reasonable wholesale electric rates. FERC bears responsibility to ensure
that a workably competitive market exists before California consumers and
California's economy are subjected to unconstrained, market-based
electricity prices. Consequently, I renew my prior request that the
Commission act with utmost speed to intervene to the fullest extent possible
to restore wholesale prices to fair levels and to remedy harms that have
resulted from the exercise of market power.

The signing of AB 970 established the Governor's Clean Energy Green Team,
which works to streamline the process of creating new power plants to ensure
that an adequate supply of power will exist to make a deregulated
marketplace work. The Team does this by working with local governments,
identifying environmental impacts, developing recommendations for low
interest financing programs for renewable energy and obtaining input on
natural gas supply, emission offsets and water supply.

Members do not receive a salary. This position does not require Senate
confirmation.

The complaint,albeit brief, filed May 1 in San Diego Superior Court by 
Strategy Integration, Inc versus Michael Aguirre and the other Hendricks  
plaintiffs' attorneys is quite extraordinary in its disclosure. A hard copy 
is being faxed. The expert firm alleges they were ""retained...to explain, 
research, and investigate potential claims of gaming and collusion by energy 
providers who supply electricity to the California Energy Market ...[and] 
...retained to perform utility and energy consulting services."" After 
alleging that the Hendricks attorneys ""refused to pay Plaintiffs' first 
billing""  it is alleged that""defendants' refusal may have resulted from the 
conclusions Plaintiff drew in its analysis."" We should consider if there is 
there a way to get this filing to Senator Dunn's office or a more friendly 
Senator  without identifying us as the source,.They can see what some expert 
in the field  hired by the plaintiffs'  class action lawyers apparently 
concluded on their own about the claims of gaming and collusion. I suspect 
that  Sen Dunn has no interest but some Republican Senator might have some 
use for it. It could  have some value if the hearings go forward. This is not 
urgent timewise but I wanted to bring it to your attention.

Today's focus: McVeigh video really a virus

By Jason Meserve (write me at jmeserve@nww.com)

You knew someone would take advantage of the recent execution
of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh to spread a virus.
According to a number of computer security types, a purported
video of the McVeigh execution circulating the 'Net is actually
a virus that drops the SubSeven backdoor onto infected systems.

For those who don't know, SubSeven can be used to take over
control of the infected machine and be used in distributed
denial-of-service attacks. The good news is that most updated
antivirus scanners already detect this virus, so if your
systems are up to date, you should be safe.

For more on this, check out this wire story posted on
DigitalMass.com:
http://digitalmass.boston.com/news/2001/06/14/mcveigh_virus.html


Today's bug patches and security alerts:


* SQL security hole lets attackers take over

A security flaw in Microsoft's SQL Server 7.0 and SQL Server
2000 Gold can allow an attacker to take control of a targeted
server, the company said in a security bulletin late Tuesday
night. Microsoft issued a patch for the flaw at the same time
it released the bulletin.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2001/0613sqlhole.html
IDG News Service, 06/13/01

For a patch and more information from Microsoft:
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-032.asp


* Microsoft has third go at Exchange hole

Microsoft has issued a third version of a patch intended to
plug a security hole that could allow hackers access to
mailboxes on Exchange Server Versions 5.5 and 2000. The second
patch contained outdated files, Microsoft said in an updated
security bulletin issued Wednesday.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2001/0614exchangehole.html
IDG News Service, 06/14/01

For a third try at getting the correct patch, click to:
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-030.asp


* HP warns of potential DoS vulnerability in kmmodreg

Hewlett-Packard is warning its HP-UX operating system users of
a potential denial-of-service vulnerability in the kmmodreg
command, which is executed each time the system is booted. The
problem with the package also could be used to increase
privileges on the affected system. HP-UX users can download a
patch for the kmmodreg problem by logging on to HP's IT
Resource Center at:
http://itrc.hp.com


* Xinetd patch released by Linux OS vendors

Many Linux vendors have released a patch for the xinetd package
that fixes a flaw in the way the application deals with TCP
WAIT commands. The problem prevents the linuxconf-web
application from working properly. Another flaw in the xinetd
package creates world-writeable files that can be used in a
symlink attack. Linux-Mandrake users can download the new patch
from:
http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/ftp.php3

Red Hat users can get more information and links to patches
from:
http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-075.html

Immunix OS 7.0-beta and 7.0 users can get the appropriate patch
from:
http://download.immunix.org/ImmunixOS/7.0/updates/RPMS/xinetd-2.1.8.9pre15-2

_imnx.i386.rpm


* Linux-Mandrake patches tcpdump

Linux-Mandrake has issued a patch for its tcpdump package that
fixes a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. The flaw could
be used in a remote attack on the tcpdump process. This patch
also fixes a previous vulnerability that could allow a remote
user to run arbitrary code on the affected system without root
privileges. The new patch can be downloaded from:
http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/ftp.php3


* Linux-Mandrake fixes imap flaw

According to an alert from Linux-Mandrake, several flaws have
been found in the UW-IMAP package that could allow an
authenticated user to gain greater shell command access. This
is particularly problematic for e-mail systems that do not
normally provide shell access. Patches can be downloaded from:
http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/ftp.php3


* Conectiva patches exim

A printf vulnerability exists in exim, a mail transfer utility.
The flaw in the code deals with the way exim check e-mail
headers without protecting against a printf format attack.
Conectiva users can download the appropriate patch from:
ftp://atualizacoes.conectiva.com.br/6.0/SRPMS/exim-3.16-4U60_1cl.src.rpm
ftp://atualizacoes.conectiva.com.br/6.0/RPMS/exim-3.16-4U60_1cl.i386.rpm
ftp://atualizacoes.conectiva.com.br/6.0/RPMS/exim-doc-3.16-4U60_1cl.i386.rpm

ftp://atualizacoes.conectiva.com.br/6.0/RPMS/exim-mon-3.16-4U60_1cl.i386.rpm



* Red Hat issues patch for ispell

According to an alert from Red Hat, the ispell program uses
mktemp() to open temporary files, which makes it vulnerable to
symlink attacks. For more information and to download a patch:
http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-074.html


* GnuPG patch available for Red Hat Linux users

GnuPG, an open source version of PGP, contains a number of
flaws that could leave a user's private key exposed. The
problem is a format string vulnerability in GnuPG's code. For
more information and links to the appropriate download:
http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-073.html


* Red Hat: LPRng fails to drop supplemental group membership

According to an alert from Red Hat, LPRng fails to drop
supplemental group membership at init time, though it does
properly setuid and setgid. The result is that LPRng, and its
children, maintain any supplemental groups that the process
starting LPRng had at the time it started LPRng. This is a
security risk. Download the appropriate patch from:

Red Hat Linux 7.0:
alpha:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/7.0/en/os/alpha/LPRng-3.7.4-23.alpha.rpm
i386:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/7.0/en/os/i386/LPRng-3.7.4-23.i386.rpm

Red Hat Linux 7.1:
i386:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/7.1/en/os/i386/LPRng-3.7.4-23.i386.rpm


* ScreamingMedia patches SiteWare vulnerability

A flaw in ScreamingMedia's SiteWare Web server could allow a
user to view all documents in the SiteWare Web hierarchy. A
similar problem could allow any file to be retrieved from the
system. More information and a patch can be found at:
http://www01.screamingmedia.com/en/security/sms1001.php


Today's round up of virus alerts:


* Simpsons worm hits Macs

When the Mac vs. PC wars start up, as they inevitably do, on
Usenet or Web message boards or just around the office, Mac
partisans always tout the dearth of viruses for their chosen
computer as one of the main benefits in adopting Apple's
operating system. And though, technically, there still may not
be very many viruses for the Mac, a new Mac e-mail worm has
recently been discovered and is making its way across iMacs and
Powerbooks everywhere.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2001/0611simpsons.html
IDG News Service, 06/11/01


* Virus hoax warns people to delete AOL

Perhaps the greatest thrill for any prankster is to have his
hoax taken as truth. Just such a thing has happened to Ray
Owens, who runs a Web site called Joke A Day. Owens sent an e-
mail to the 342,000 of his subscribers on June 5 (after an
initial mailing on June 2 to another list) warning them of a
new virus, called AOL.EXE. Warning your customers of a virus
seems like a nice thing to do, except that AOL.EXE isn't a
virus at all; it's the AOL application that provides Internet
access to millions of people worldwide.
http://www.nwfusion.com/net.worker/news/2001/0611aolhoax.html
IDG News Service, 06/11/01

* WM97/Myna-AR - A Word macro virus with no malicious payload.
(Sophos)

* XM97/Laroux-OC - This Excel macro virus spreads by creating a
file called ""BINV.XLS"" in the XLSTART directory. (Sophos)

* WM97/Opey-AU - This Word macro virus removes the macros
section of the tools menu and disables the Visual Basic Editor.
It also displays five different messages on five different
dates. (Sophos)

* XM97/Barisada-Y - An Excel macro virus that spreads via a
file called ""KHM.XLS"" in the XLSTART directory. Unlike its
predecessors, this one does not contain pop-up messages.
(Sophos)

* VBS/Lovelet-CE - Yet another variant of the infamous
LoveLetter virus. This one comes with a subject line of ""News
Email Beta Run1.01"" and a file attachment called
""NEWSEMAIL.VBS."" (Sophos)


>From the interesting reading department:


* Hackers taunt EC with site defacement

Dutch hackers on Tuesday evening defaced SaferInternet.org, a
Web site sponsored by the European Commission that promotes a
safer Internet. Security at the site had been increased just
last week after other hackers raised a red flag about possible
vulnerabilities.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2001/0613hackers.html
IDG News Service, 06/13/01


* Microsoft plugs seven Telnet security holes in Windows 2000

If the Telnet service included with Microsoft's Windows 2000
operating system has looked suspiciously like Swiss cheese
recently, that might be because it has seven security holes
that need patching. Microsoft has acknowledged the holes and
issued a patch late last week.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2001/0611msplug.html
IDG News Service, 06/11/01


* When private peering arrangements go bad: Cable & Wireless
shuts out 14 ISPs, including PSINet

Cable & Wireless likely didn't make any new friends on the
Internet last week when it started enforcing its newly revised
peering policy, cutting off service to more than a dozen ISPs.

Portland, Ore.-Based Firm Says California Has Capacity for Electricity Needs
Dan McSwain , North County Times, Escondido, Calif.

( October 17, 2000 )



Oct. 13--PORTLAND, Ore.--A private investigation of state power markets has 
come to the conclusion that California had plenty of electricity generating 
capacity this summer.

The state enjoyed a 32 percent reserve margin even as wholesale prices soared 
and the state's power manager declared 36 separate ""power emergencies"" 
because California was thought to be in the grips of a critical shortage, 
according to the investigation.

The author of the investigation's preliminary report, Portland-based 
economist and utility industry consultant Robert McCullough, said at a 
conference of analysts, power traders and electricity industry regulators 
Thursday that he has found evidence that generators and trading companies 
manipulated the production of power from June through August to create a 
false shortage and push up prices.

The Encina power plant in Carlsbad provides a stark example: it ran at well 
below its full capacity for much of June, even though wholesale power prices 
---- and consumer electricity bills ---- shot to well above the generating 
plant's cost of production.

The actual production of electricity by the plants was determined by an 
analysis of data from the Environmental Protection Agency, which monitors 
emissions.

""We are seeing a lot of under-generation,"" McCullough said. ""This is market 
power in action.""

Market power is a term used by economists to describe the ability of market 
participants -- in this case suppliers -- to influence prices.

Many of the industry experts present at the conference Thursday reaffirmed 
their belief that supply shortages were very real this summer, and 
contributed to high prices, but several participants said deregulation has 
reduced the amount of market information that is available to analysts. 
Mainstream economists have questioned the accuracy of data from federal 
agencies, including the EPA.

Conventional explanations for the low energy production observed in San Diego 
County are scant.

Encina's operators, a joint venture of energy giants Dynegy Inc. and NRG 
Energy Inc. called Cabrillo Power, confirmed that the power plant had no 
abnormal maintenance problems. The San Diego Regional Air Quality Board said 
Wednesday that the power plant was well within its state-mandated pollution 
limits.

But David Lloyd, the corporate secretary of Cabrillo, denied that the Encina 
plant has been used to game the San Diego County power markets.

""That can't possibly be right,"" Lloyd said of McCullough's analysis. ""In 
North County, we were right on the ragged edge of being off (an emergency 
shutdown because of heavy output).

""Without knowing the specific details of time and which units were on or off, 
I can't comment,"" Lloyd said.

""We certainly don't want to be accused of anything wrongful,"" he said. ""We 
don't have that much power in California, and for us to be shutting down in 
California to push up the price somewhere else doesn't make sense for us. We 
want to run all we can when the prices are high.""

Electricity prices have soared to record levels since May, resulting in a 
doubling and tripling of power bills this summer for the 1.2 million 
customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Co. and causing an estimated $5 billion 
in losses for Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric.

State lawmakers have intervened on behalf of San Diego County consumers with 
a retail rate cap, but the law in turn created a looming IOU that could grow 
beyond $300 million if high wholesale prices persist.

No fewer than five private, state and federal investigations are under way to 
assess the competitiveness of power markets in the interconnected Western 
states. The investigations also seek to answer charges that the companies 
which produce and trade electricity have either figured out how to exploit 
deregulated markets to outmaneuver regulators or have engaged in outright 
manipulation in order to increase profits.

Inquiries by the California Public Utilities Commission, Electricity 
Oversight Board and attorney general, along with a Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission investigation, were launched in July and August. Staff 
investigators of the state and federal commissions said this week that they 
are still in the process of issuing subpoenas and gathering market data.

McCullough was hired in late May by the Seattle city utility and a consortium 
of large industrial power consumers in the Pacific Northwest to investigate 
the price spikes. His effort is thought to be the first to complete an 
exhaustive analysis of state and federal information that tracks the amount 
of electricity that was available and compares it to the amount of power that 
was actually used.

Chief among McCullough's findings was that demand for power was lower this 
summer than what was forecasted by the Western Systems Coordinating Council, 
a federal agency that is charged with ensuring the stability of the vast web 
of power transmission lines that connect California to 13 other Western 
states, British Columbia and northern Mexico.

McCullough provided a copy of his preliminary findings Tuesday to the North 
County Times, and the initial reaction of the state's energy community was 
one of deep skepticism.

""EPA data is notoriously unreliable,"" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford professor 
and the chairman of the market surveillance committee of the California 
Independent System Operator, the agency that manages the state grid and which 
has paid enormous sums for emergency power this summer. To gauge the actual 
output of power plants that burn fossil fuel, McCullough used emissions data 
from the EPA.

""Greed would get the best of anybody,"" Wolak said. ""I found a lot of hours 
where in-state generators were exceeding nameplate capacity. These guys were 
cranking it out.""

Wolak, in a study of power markets for the system operator, did conclude, 
however, that exercise of market power by power generators and traders was 
the major cause of higher prices this summer.

At the conference in Portland, most of the panelists did not openly criticize 
McCullough's analysis, but implicitly disputed his conclusions by attributing 
higher prices and the presumed exercise of market power to a very real 
shortage of electricity generating capacity among the Western states.

Low hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest and high temperatures 
in the Southwest were blamed for limiting California's ability to import 
electricity.

Others said state and federal regulators, along with market participants 
themselves, won't really know what happened until more experts look at hard 
market information that is in short supply.

Ron Eachus, the chairman of the Oregon Public Utilities Commission, said 
market information is routinely withheld from regulators, the public and 
buyers of electricity, but is shared among power generators and trading 
companies.

""If the market is sharing it with themselves, but not us, I don't buy that,"" 
Eachus said.

Tim Belden is the vice president of West Trading for Enron North America, the 
largest marketer and trader of electricity in the world. Enron takes the 
unique stand that more information which has been labeled ""proprietary"" by 
companies, such as when a plant is being run and how much the electricity is 
selling for, should be made available instantly to the markets.

""Is there a smoking gun out there or are market participants behaving 
rationally?"" Belden said.

""California is characterized by secret, black box market models that nobody 
understands,"" he said. ""If you've got nothing to hide, release the data.""

Last night I attended the National Republican Senatorial Committee's 
reception at Senator Frist's home in DC.  (Frist is the NRSC chairman this 
cycle.)  Enron, including Jeff and Linda, had been invited to the reception, 
the purpose of which was to introduce ex-RNC chairman Haley Barbour as the 
NRSC's National Finance Chairman.  Present were over a dozen Republican 
senators, including Minority Leader Lott, Whip Nickles, and Sens. Kay Bailey 
Hutchison, Bunning (KY), Fitzgerald (IL), Cochran (MS), Inhofe (OK), Bond 
(MO), Crapo (ID), Voinovich (OH), Allen (VA), and Chafee (RI).

The ""news"" from our perspective is that Haley Barbour singled out Ken Lay for 
praise as the first person to step to the plate and agree to help with their 
new ""Majority Makers"" program.  This is the effort that Barbour will head up 
to raise $21 million for this election cycle by concentrating on events 
outside DC that would target businesses and business leaders without a DC 
presence.  Barbour said that Ken had agreed to organize and chair a Houston 
fundraiser to raise $1 million toward the $21 million total.  Ken was the 
first name he mentioned.  The only others were the DeVos family in Michigan 
and Julie Finley, a major GOP fundraiser based in DC.

Needless to say, I was suddenly quite ""popular"" after Haley made his remarks 
to the assembled group.  Haley said he looked forward to working with us on 
this project.

As you know from a previous e-mail, Pat Shortridge had earlier seen our 
mutual friend Mitch Bainwol, the executive director of the NRSC, who had told 
Pat at lunch last week that Haley had spoken with Ken, but last night was the 
first I had heard a dollar figure -- and a big one at that -- linked to the 
effort.  While it was not stated, I assume from the location and size of the 
event's goal that the President would be involved (but this is only an 
educated assumption on my part).

Later I saw Karen Hughes of the White House staff, but I do not think she was 
present when Haley made his comments.","Ken Lay Mention At NRSC Reception Last Night. Last night I attended the National Republican Senatorial Committee's reception at Senator Frist's home in DC.

Dear Mr. Skilling,

On behalf of Mayor Willie L. Brown, Jr. (San Francisco), it is my
pleasure to invite you to meet with him regarding energy issues in
California.

Mayor Brown wishes to meet with you in his capacity as a trustee of the
Board of Administration of the California Public Employees Retirement
System (CalPERS).  As you know, CalPERS is the largest public pension fund
in the
nation and is a sizeable investor in domestic energy stocks, bonds,
debentures, etc.  The Board has appointed Mayor Brown to lead a
delegation of trustees to meet with the CEOs of CalPERS' largest energy
holdings.  Enron represents one such holding.

The Mayor would be pleased to host you in his office at the newly
renovated City Hall in San Francisco or arrange an alternative location at
your earliest convenience.  I
will await your response.

Sincerely,

Monique Moyer
Director, Mayor's Office of Public Finance
City & County of San Francisco

 He keeps saying that he ""needs"" the $15 million.  Maybe it's a budget thing. 
I think he really just wants to renegotiate the deal.  I don't think he

Please think about this proposed project and keep involved with suggestions and information as you receive such.  Be prepared to discuss proposal at the next ""Round Table"" and offer remarks via e-mail to any appropriate Enron person, but particulars to Walter Coffer.

""Current Transmission Project""

Initial concept of Mandate and Plan of Action

1) Pinpoint restrictions in the Transmission system and then develop a strategy for profiting by mitigation or other actions.  

This is an effort that should be spread company wide with everyone who works with Transmission or learns a detail that relates to Transmission.

2) Use our ""Transmission Round Table"" to gather the knowledge and ideas that we need to formulate our strategy.

Share this knowledge through a website to be set up.

Activate all who work with Transmission or have any good ideas on the subject.

3) Develop a team to do the required work under a mandate from Dave Duran; directed by Walter Coffer.

4) Develop strategies for working with each type of competing regional Transmission entities. (ISO, Transco, RTO)

5) List pertinent Enron web pages, what should be on them, and who to talk to about the information contained in each.

Steve and Cindy,

Attached is the electronic ""Save the Date"" memo for the Management Conference.  We are preparing to send it out next week.  Please let me know if you have any comments or concerns on the e-mail.  

As for distribution, we've worked with HR on the distribution list for VPs; but will circle back with David Oxley's team to ensure we have the most up-to-date list.  Since some VPs in redeployment will most likely find positions within Enron by November, I don't plan to exclude them from the distribution ... unlike United Way, where we are not soliciting employees in redeployment for a contribution.

I look forward to any feedback.

Dear Mr. Skilling,

On behalf of Mayor Willie L. Brown, Jr. (San Francisco), it is my
pleasure to invite you to meet with him regarding energy issues in
California.

Mayor Brown wishes to meet with you in his capacity as a trustee of the
Board of Administration of the California Public Employees Retirement
System (CalPERS).  As you know, CalPERS is the largest public pension fund
in the
nation and is a sizeable investor in domestic energy stocks, bonds,
debentures, etc.  The Board has appointed Mayor Brown to lead a
delegation of trustees to meet with the CEOs of CalPERS' largest energy
holdings.  Enron represents one such holding.

The Mayor would be pleased to host you in his office at the newly
renovated City Hall in San Francisco or arrange an alternative location at
your earliest convenience.  I
will await your response.

Sincerely,

Monique Moyer

Manager's Journal: Heir to Greatness
By Gary Hamel

09/18/2000

Sometime in the next few months, the board of General Electric will anoint a 
successor to the world's most
celebrated corporate leader. Running GE may be, as Jack Welch claims, the 
best job in the world, but his
successor may find it to be one of the toughest as well -- not because 
anything is going wrong at GE, but because
so much is going right, and has been for so long. 

Mr. Welch's successor will inherit a company that is already stupendously 
valuable, that has already shed most of
its unwanted pounds, and has already set a string of performance records. How 
do you do better than that?

This is more than a rhetorical question for GE's next chairman. Pity, for a 
moment, a few other heirs to greatness.
Doug Ivester was gone just 25 months after following the legendary Roberto 
Goizueta at Coca-Cola. Dale Morrison
lasted less than four years at Campbell Soup after taking over from 
cost-cutter extraordinaire David Johnson. British
Airway's Bob Ayling got pushed out after he had struggled unsuccessfully to 
fill the shoes of Colin Marshall. And
Durk Jager prematurely stepped down as Procter & Gamble's chairman after 
failing to live up to the lofty standards
set by earlier P&G leaders. 

Pretenders 

None of the pretenders succeeded in building greatness on top of greatness. 
In three of these cases, the board
brought back a recently retired CEO or chairman to shore up investor 
confidence. Sadly, Goizueta, who died in
October 1997, could not reprise his earlier success at Coca-Cola. 

GE's next chairman will have to exceed Mr. Welch's near-mythic 
accomplishments if GE is to continue to fly high.
Like Cisco, Intel, Wal-Mart, Nokia and any other company that is exploring 
the outer atmosphere, GE must struggle
ever harder to resist the laws that threaten to flatten the arc of success: 
the law of large numbers, the law of
diminishing returns, and the law of averages. 

-- The law of large numbers: Over the past decade GE's market value has 
multiplied eleven-fold -- to more than $560
billion from $50 billion at the end of 1990. Sustaining such a breathtaking 
pace of value growth gets progressively
harder as a company gets bigger. As the most valuable company on the planet, 
GE would need to grow its market
cap to nearly $3 trillion over the next five years to match the 42% 
compounded annual growth rate it has achieved
over the past half-decade. 

One way of escaping the law of large numbers is to divide big things into 
small things. One option for GE would be
to spin out its low-growth businesses as separate companies. Over the past 
five years, profits in two sectors --
appliances and plastics -- were essentially flat. Holding these businesses 
may generate a positive return on
invested capital, but no investor would keep them inside a growth portfolio. 
Why should GE? 

If GE's next chairman can't muster the courage to leave the dawdlers behind, 
perhaps he -- or she -- should spin out
the stars. Of the eight large business segments for which GE reports results, 
two -- GE Capital and NBC -- account
for nearly 50% of GE's five-year profit growth. Sure, GE Capital has 
benefited from its parent's dirt-cheap cost of
capital, but from an investor's point of view, these advantages may be more 
than offset by the drag of laggardly
earnings growth in other GE businesses. Looking beyond capital and 
broadcasting, there are probably a dozen
other high-growth candidates for spin-outs in GE's other sectors. 

Mr. Welch's successor shouldn't be afraid to disassemble GE. After all, the 
goal is not to make GE the ""world's
most valuable company,"" but to make its shareholders the world's most richly 
rewarded. Shareholders don't care
whether GE's stock appreciates or whether it's the stock of companies that GE 
has disgorged. Breaking up is hard
to do. But Mr. Welch's successor may find that turning GE into the world's 
first $3 trillion company is even harder. 

-- The law of diminishing returns: Even the most successful strategies lose 
their potency over time. For most of Mr.
Welch's tenure, GE's strategies of choice have been cost cutting and 
acquisitions. From its unflinching approach to
downsizing in the mid-1980s, to its more recent dedication to e-business, Mr. 
Welch's GE has been imaginative
and unrelenting in excising waste. At the same time, GE's top line has been 
buoyed up by a tidal wave of
acquisitions -- more than 300 in the past three years, many outside the U.S. 

The payoff to all this cutting and deal making has been steadily accelerating 
earnings growth. Net earnings grew
10.8% in 1996, 12.7% in 1997, 13.3% in 1998 and 15.3% in 1999. Looking 
forward, power dieting and binge buying
may not be enough to keep GE's earnings escalator rising ever skyward. 

There are already signs that GE may be nearing the asymptotic end of the 
efficiency curve. Between 1981 and
1990, GE's revenue per employee increased by 187%. Yet over the last decade, 
revenue per employee grew by a
more modest 55%, and has been essentially flat since 1996. And while 
operating margins in GE's manufacturing
businesses have been steadily improving, GE's net profit margin, after all 
adjustments, has remained pretty much
unchanged over the past five years. 

What about acquisitions? While industry consolidation still has a way to run, 
particularly outside the U.S., it seems
inevitable that it will become harder and harder for GE to find under-priced, 
under-managed fixer-uppers. After all, at
the current furious pace of corporate coupling, the U.S. would be left with a 
single company by 2010. 

That leaves ""e."" E-commerce will drive new efficiencies into GE's business 
processes, but GE is not alone in
striving to e-enable its businesses. E-commerce is rapidly becoming an 
information technology arms race -- with
competitors making tit-for-tat investments to reap tit-for-tat efficiency 
gains. And while efficiency-besotted CEOs are
counting on the Internet to shrink procurement costs, savvy customers will be 
just as creative in using the Net to
beat down prices. Whether GE's enthusiasm for all things ""e"" produces 
long-lasting, peer-beating profit growth
remains to be seen. 

GE's next chairman may want to borrow a lesson or two from Enron, which has 
been voted America's most
innovative company five years running and displaced GE as the ""best managed 
company"" in Fortune magazine's
last ""most admired"" survey. Forty percent of Enron's $63 billion market value 
comes from businesses the company
wasn't even in three years ago -- all of them are homegrown. 

Forget acquisitions. With GE's powerful brand, global reach and fearsome 
capacity for execution, there's no reason
GE shouldn't surpass Enron as a business-building champ. It is entirely 
reasonable to expect that GE could create
10 to 20 new businesses over the next few years -- with each adding an 
average of $5 billion to GE's market value. 

Sooner or later GE is going to need an entirely new genre of wealth-creating 
strategies -- and a much more
aggressive commitment to internally generated new business development may 
well be the most promising
candidate. 

-- The law of averages: Over the past five years, GE's price/earnings ratio 
has tripled, from just over 16 to more than
48. The company is currently selling at a 65% premium to the market average 
P/E. But being a standout performer
for more than a few years at a time is a daunting challenge for any company, 
large or small. It seems that no
company can forever escape the steady tug of mediocrity. 

At the end of 1999, the Standard & Poor's 500 included 326 companies that had 
been in the index for the entire
decade. Fifty-five of these companies, among them GE, managed to deliver top 
quartile shareholder returns in as
many as four years out of the previous 10. GE's top quartile results came in 
1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999. If GE's
new chairman manages to extend this streak for another four years, GE will 
set a new world record, for none of the
326 S&P veterans achieved top quartile returns in as many as eight years out 
of 10 during the '90s, and only four
companies -- Oracle, Home Depot, Intel and Cisco -- cleared the bar seven 
years out of 10. 

If GE can fire up the entrepreneurial spirit in each of its employees, it 
just might beat the odds. Like most large
companies, GE seems to be reluctant to encourage employees to start new 
businesses by giving them equity
stakes in new ventures. While this isn't the only way to build businesses, 
it's one that can't be ignored in a world
where talented employees are often lured away by the promise of a big chunk 
of equity in a start-up. GE already
invests in start-ups via GE Equity -- to the tune of $1.5 billion in 1999. 
Last year GE also repurchased $1.9 billion of
its own stock. One wonders just what kind of new wealth GE's own employees 
might have been able to create if
they had been backed by this kind of capital? 

To have any hope of escaping Mr. Welch's shadow, and matching his success, 
GE's next chairman will have to
keep a simple truth in mind: If you're trying to achieve unprecedented ends, 
you're going to need unprecedented
means. A break-up, a few major spin-outs, a bottom-to-top initiative focused 
on making GE as good at creating bold
new businesses as it is at improving existing businesses, an absolute 
commitment to doubling or tripling GE's
internal growth rate -- these are all potential candidates for the next big 
thing at GE. 

Maybe, just maybe, GE will continue to fly high with its current success 
recipes. One could argue that as long as
there are companies around the world that aren't as well-managed as GE, Mr. 
Welch's magnificent buy-and-improve
engine will have plenty of fuel. Or that GE's Web-smitten executives will 
discover Net advantages no one else has
yet dreamed of. 

After 20 years under Mr. Welch, GE is habituated to meeting new challenges. 
Moreover, GE has a long history of
organizational and managerial innovation -- it was among the first to 
decentralize along business unit lines, embrace
disciplined strategic planning, delayer its hierarchical organization, and 
commit itself to becoming Webified from
stem to stern. Like the Internet, GE is diverse, global, flat, meritocratic 
and non-hierarchical. 

Maybe all of this will help GE to become one of the first companies to marry 
the rule-busting, business-building
ethos of the ""new economy"" with the ""old economy"" virtues of scale, 
efficiency and quality. If GE succeeds, there
will be no more talk of new economy and old economy, for GE will have managed 
to create a perfect synthesis of
old and new. And the most perfectly developed specimen of the industrial age 
will have become the archetype for
the post-industrial corporation -- a company that uses its size and 
operational excellence to crush the upstarts, and
its industry-transforming innovation to constantly surprise the old farts. 
This is a worthy, and necessary, aspiration
for the next leader of America's pre-eminent corporation.

Spiraling energy costs creating near-crisis situation 
The heat is on consumers

Abreast of the Market
S&P Index Seemed Tranquil This Year, but...
By E.S. Browning
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

09/18/2000
The Wall Street Journal

Amid the storm that has swept the Nasdaq Composite Index this year, the 
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index
looks like a sea of tranquility. 

Since Jan. 1, it has gone almost exactly nowhere, starting the year at 
1469.25 and closing Friday at 1465.81.

But beneath the quiet surface, a furious battle is raging among the S&P's 
components, with some of last year's
losers becoming this year's winners. 

Some of the most amazing performers are the natural-gas companies, which are 
up about 70% as a group so far
this year. ""The natural-gas index looks like an Internet stock from a year 
ago,"" says Richard Bernstein, chief
quantitative strategist at Merrill Lynch. 

El Paso Energy is up 70% so far this year. KeySpan Energy is up almost 60%. 
On top of its stock gain, KeySpan
offers something some investors aren't familiar with: a 5% dividend. 

Now the big question is, should investors be plowing their money into the 
recent winners, which also include drug
stocks, brokerage-firm stocks and bank stocks? Or is their surge a flash in 
the pan that will evaporate as investors
get over their jitters in the fall? 

Higher oil prices helped send utility stocks up on Friday, and most other 
stocks down. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average fell 1.45%, or 160.47 points, to 10927.00, leaving the blue-chip 
index down 2.62%, or 293.65 points, for the
week. 

The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 2.01% on the day and 3.6% on the week. 
The Dow Jones Utility Average,
however, rose 1.52%, or 5.94 points, on Friday to a record 397.04, leaving it 
up 2.78% on the week. 

The S&P 500, still the broadest of the major market indexes, dropped 1% on 
Friday. But it is just 4% off its record
of 1527.46, set March 24. In contrast, the technology-heavy Nasdaq index is 
down 24% from its March 10 high. 

Within the S&P 500, though, there have been some dramatic moves. Utilities 
are up an astounding 40%, just in the
time since the S&P peaked on March 24, according to Ned Davis Research. 
Financials and drug stocks are up
about 16% each -- again, since the S&P hit a record. 

Communications stocks, on the other hand, have fallen 25% in that period. The 
S&P 500's big tech stocks are
down more than 19%. 

Some analysts think the move that is under way is broader than a sector 
rotation. Some of the least-wanted stocks
of 1999 have become desirable this year. As huge stocks, such as Qualcomm and 
Yahoo!, have sagged, smaller,
once-neglected S&P companies, such as Reebok and Allied Waste, have soared. 

The switch can be seen in an index called the Value Line Arithmetic Index. 
That index tracks about 1,700
companies and doesn't give any extra weight to the ones with a larger market 
value. It is a closer reflection of the
average company, rather than the biggest companies. 

So far this year, it is up 13%, eclipsing the S&P 500. The S&P 500 is 
weighted according to its members' market
value, which means that it is dominated by the larger stocks. The Value Line 
index's strength compared with the
S&P 500 is a clear indication that some of the smaller stocks are making a 
comeback, at least for now. 

Some of the gains do seem to reflect special circumstances. Utilities have 
been helped by an explosion in
natural-gas prices and by a search for stable investments in a turbulent 
stock market. Many banks and brokerage
firms have benefited from takeover speculation: Merrill Lynch is up 66% so 
far this year; Lehman Brothers is up
69%. 

If takeover expectations fade, the brokerage stocks risk a slide. And energy 
companies depend on oil and gas
prices, which can make them volatile. Natural-gas bulls note, however, that 
natural-gas prices are expected to
remain high for some time, which could keep propelling that group ahead. 

""Very few people thought energy prices would remain this high for as long as 
they have,"" notes Donaldson, Lufkin &
Jenrette investment strategist Thomas Galvin. ""So you still have people 
underweighted both areas, energy and
utilities."" 

That means that there still are plenty of skeptics out there. If gas prices 
stay high, the stocks have room to rise as
skeptics are won over. 

But the real trick during the coming months may not be to be in the right 
sector, but to be in the right stock, both
men say. 

At a time when the economy is slowing and earnings growth will be more 
difficult, ""you probably want higher-quality
stocks, because they have more stable earnings,"" Mr. Bernstein says. 

When tech stocks or utility stocks are in favor, it is enough to buy a stock 
from the group and your stock will go up.
Now investors need to be more selective. 

""El Paso and Duke Energy are extremely well managed,"" says Mr. Galvin, ""as is 
Enron. But the rising tide in
utilities has lifted all boats, and not all utilities are well enough managed 
to take advantage of all opportunities."" 

The key is choosing the stocks that will withstand the more difficult times 
to come, and that won't be easy. People
who bought Intel or Oracle at the start of this year probably feel as if it 
wasn't that bad a year for tech. Both, despite
a recent sag, still are up almost 40% this year. Those who chose Microsoft or 
Dell, however, took a bath: Microsoft
is down 45% since the year began, and Dell is down almost 30%. 

Mr. Galvin thinks tech stocks will stage a fourth-quarter rally, as investors 
look for companies that can continue to
build profits in a slowing economy. He points out that analysts expect tech 
to post 38% earnings growth next year,
only a bit less than this year's 41%. But benefiting from any rally would 
require picking the stocks that will have the
good earnings. 

Another way of looking at the uncertain future, says Bob Bissell, president 
of Wells Capital Management, is that
there could be some unexpected events. Companies whose stock prices have 
fallen could be acquired, or forced to
restructure, which could provide a payoff for investors. 

""I am thinking of companies like AT&T,"" he says. ""Something has got to give 
there. The stock is down to the low
30s,"" 47% down from its 52-week high of 61. ""Something has got to happen. Do 
you fragment the company?"" 

He also points to midcap stocks, another of the year's strongest performers. 
""I call the category `the forgotten
prince,' "" he says. The S&P Midcap 400 index is doing even better than the 
Value Line index, up 22% since the
year began. 

Some midcap companies deserve to be forgotten, of course. But the index also 
contains some smaller banks that
could be takeover targets, and it has some fast-growing tech companies too. 
""It is getting stronger as the
technological revolution moves companies rapidly from smallcap to midcap,"" 
Mr. Bissell says.

Friday's Market Activity 

Soaring energy prices knocked market averages sharply lower. 

American Express lost $1.50 to $59.31, Chase Manhattan dropped 1.66 to 49, 
and General Electric, which has an
exposure to the group through its financial-services operations, gave up 2.13 
to 56.69. 

The group also suffered from a cooling in takeover speculation. Lehman 
Brothers, for example, fell 8 to 142.50,
Goldman Sachs lost 4.25 to 124.75 and Bear Stearns gave up 4.75 to 65. 

Higher oil prices helped Exxon Mobil rise 3.60 to 88.88. It reached a 52-week 
high, its first since Dec. 9, while
Amerada Hess climbed 4.56 to 73.25, and touched a 52-week high of its own. 

Database software company Oracle (Nasdaq) fell 6.63 to 78.31, with 60 million 
shares changing hands. Despite
Oracle's announcement of strong quarterly earnings Thursday after the end of 
normal trading, some analysts said
they were disappointed with the company's revenue growth. 

Siebel Systems (Nasdaq), an Oracle competitor, added 4.19 to 99. However, i2 
Technologies fell 3.69 to 172.19,
while Ariba lost 5.13 to 152.44, both on Nasdaq. 

Red Hat (Nasdaq) lost 4.06 to 21.19. The Research Triangle Park, N.C., 
developer of open-source software products
posted a narrower-than-expected second-quarter loss, but left some analysts 
disappointed. 

Avon Products eased 50 cents to 41.19. The New York beauty-products marketing 
concern said late Thursday the
Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating a $10 million charge the 
company took in 1999 related to the
write-off of computer software. 

Adobe Systems (Nasdaq) moved up 7.25 to 132.63. The San Jose, Calif., 
software developer reported fiscal
third-quarter earnings that topped forecasts. 

Maytag fell 2.19 to 33.63, after the Newton, Iowa, home-appliance maker 
warned about second-half earnings. 

Ivax rose 2.38 to 43.63. The Miami pharmaceutical maker received final 
approved from the Food and Drug
Administration for its generic equivalent of Bristol-Myers Squibb's cancer 
drug Taxol. 

Carnival Corp. gained 1.75 to 22.88, while rival Royal Caribbean Cruises 
advanced 1.75 to 24.50. The stocks rose
on hopes that the withdrawal from the market of a smaller competitor will 
ease excess capacity.

The Homestretch

The Gore and Bush campaigns will argue over which did better in the debate 
over debates, but one winner is clear:
PBS news anchor Jim Lehrer. Not only will he moderate all three presidential 
debates sponsored by the bipartisan
Commission on Presidential Debates, but, under an agreement completed over 
the weekend, he will do so under
rules giving him more flexibility than ever before. He will be free to bore 
in on a specific subject and extend
discussion of it, rather than simply move on to other questions as in the 
past. Under the debate agreement, the two
candidates will stand behind lecterns at the opening debate Oct. 3, sit 
around a table in talk-show fashion on Oct.
11, and debate in a town-hall format on Oct. 17. 

In other campaign developments:

-- Housing policy? In the closest thing yet to a campaign debate on housing 
issues, the Republican party's Web
site is trying to entice listeners to dial in to radio talk shows and charge 
that Democrats are running ""The Slumlord
Ticket."" Why? On top of a recent controversy over complaints by tenants of a 
rental house in Tennessee owned by
Vice President Gore, the Web site touts the story of a similar headache now 
faced by running mate Joseph
Lieberman. An immigrant mother was evicted when she was injured and fell 
behind in rent payments at a property
owned by the estate of Mr. Lieberman's wealthy late uncle; Mr. Lieberman is 
executor of the estate. 

-- A fish story: To the list of the perils of holding public office, now add 
the danger of flying fish. Just ask Rep. Helen
Chenoweth-Hage, an Idaho Republican, who was pelted with rotting salmon 
thrown by a 20-year-old protester at a
hearing on Western wildfires held in Montana over the weekend. The protester 
cried out that the conservative
congresswoman is ""the greatest threat to the forest"" and uncorked the salmon. 
She wasn't hurt, but the Associated
Press reports that ""the hearing was recessed while she cleaned salmon from 
her hair and jacket.""

GE Tops Fortune's Ranking of the World's Most Admired Companies; Key To 
Staying Ahead of the Pack Is Innovation

09/18/2000
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2000, Business Wire)

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 18, 2000--For the third straight year, 
General Electric, on the strength of its
management team and innovative global strategy, is No. 1 on FORTUNE's ranking 
of the most admired companies
in the world. FORTUNE's third annual list of Global Most Admired Companies 
consists of 379 companies in 27
industries, with 25 selected as ""all-stars"" for exemplifying leadership on a 
global scale. Cisco Systems came in at
No. 2 on the all-star ranking (up from No. 8 in 1999); other repeat 
performers in the top ten include Microsoft, whose
battles with government regulators on one flank and perceptions of a 
foundering Internet strategy on the other
caused it to slip to No. 3 from No. 2; Intel (No.4); and Wal-Mart Stores, 
which moved up to No. 5 from No. 7. The
complete list of FORTUNE's Global Most Admired Companies appears in the 
October 2 issue of FORTUNE and is
available at www.fortune.com as of Monday, Sept.18, at 8:30 a.m. 

According to Nicholas Stein's article, ""The World's Most Admired Companies,"" 
the schizophrenic market conditions
of the past year offer one reason why the Most Admired list looks so 
different this year. As Stein writes: ""The
winners are companies that demonstrated a new-economy style growth strategy 
while maintaining an old-economy
approach to fiscal responsibility."" And, as Vicki Wright, global managing 
director of the Hay Group consultancy that
helped produce the list with FORTUNE notes: ""There is something new this year 
in how we perceive companies. It
is the emphasis on how much companies are capable of looking forward. In a 
year when old-economy companies
have not seen their share price perform, those that have managed to weather 
both the old- and new-economy
storms will flourish.""

Notable changes among this year's Global Most Admired list include Home Depot 
leaping from No. 20 to No. 9,
Toyota moving up from No. 16 to No. 10, and Citgroup advancing from No. 25 to 
No. 18. Strong demand for Sony's
flat-screen TVs, digital cameras, and PlayStation game consoles helped the 
company move up from 14 to 6.
Newcomers to this year's list -- Enron, Nokia, Charles Schwab, UPS, and 
Goldman Sachs -- all embody business
strategies that bridge the old and new economic worlds. Companies that lost 
their all-star status -- IBM,
Hewlett-Packard, AT&T, Procter & Gamble, DaimlerChrysler -- have been plagued 
with difficulties integrating new
business concepts. 

Many of the industry categories also experienced significant turnover. Among 
airline companies, Singapore Airlines,
which didn't even make last year's list, took the top spot from Southwest. 
British Airways, hobbled by internal
conflict and heightened competition, fell from third to seventh. Though Intel 
held on to the top ranking in the
computer hardware and software category, Sun Microsystems rode the dot-com 
revolution to second place, up from
sixth last year, while Dell, facing a wireless (and PC-less) future, fell 
from fifth to eighth. And in the white-hot
network communications and Internet technology sector, all-star newcomer 
Nokia edged Cisco Systems for top
billing. 

To find out what unique management qualities set these companies apart from 
their peers, the Hay Group surveyed
the Most Admired Companies and their less admired peers about the performance 
measures they use to chart the
progress of their companies. 

According to their findings, Most Admired companies set more challenging 
goals, link the compensation of their
executives more closely to the completion of those goals, and are generally 
more oriented toward long-term
performance. 

To complete the list of the world's most admired companies, FORTUNE consulted 
the experts: the business
executives who run companies, and the analysts who study them. Global 
companies were rated according to eight
criteria: quality of management; quality of products or services; 
innovativeness; long-term investment value; financial
soundness; ability to attract, develop and retain talent; community 
responsibility; and use of corporate assets. To
reflect this list's international scope, a ninth category was added: global 
business acumen. A company's overall
ranking is the average of the scores of all nine attributes. Companies are 
ranked within their industry, and the top 25
-- the All-Stars -- are culled from across all industry groups. 


The October 2 issue is available on newsstands beginning September 25. For

Is there anything we can tell them about the rates they should expect from 
the utility?  I think that will be the biggest concern and we can reduce 
backlash if we can provide them some information.

Subject: Idea


AEP, ComEd, Duke and CP&L announced last week that they would be 
collaborating on a new version of a net based system better than OASIS.  I 
think that Enron should consider joining with these utilities on this.  There 
may be substantial Enron upside to such a venture from added information 
disclosure and standardization and streamlining for easier use:

On 7/14, FERC issued an Advance NOPR asking for input by 2/15/01 on OASIS 
Phase II (the new OASIS proposal).  In particular, FERC states that this new 
OASIS should address: (i) communication of critical market information (like 
transmission rights); (ii) posting of ATC, TTC, and CBM; and (ii) seams 
issues between RTOs (transmission service across multiple RTOs).  FERC says 
that the new OASIS should make use of Internet, interactive displays, etc.  
FERC also asks for information on dynamic notification (where the OASIS 
automatically alerts the customer to changes in ATC, reservations, etc.)  
This type of functionality would allow Enron to determine if it wants to stay 
in a queue when transmission becomes available (rather than getting kicked 
out after the first denial for lack of ATC.)  FERC also wants information on 
whether generator-run status should be included on OASIS; electronic 
scheduling (which can now be done via etag); and business practices that 
should be standardized.
Enron could have significant input to force these utilities to propose a 
good, customer friendly system that provides valid and helpful data on ATC, 
TTC, and CBM, rather than the total lack of substantive information that is 
available today.  (Recall that Enron proposed that CBM use be posted--FERC 
has not adopted that idea yet.)
Because these are critical utilities, any system that they propose may be 
very likely to be adopted (with some changes).  I think it is better to be in 
on the front end.  Enron's participation would also give validity to their 
system.
Dan Larcamp told me that he would like more ""classes"" for his staff from 
Enron and that we should give joint classes with AEP because Susan Tomasky 
told Dan L. that ""AEP has nothing to hide.""  This type of venture would allow 
AEP one venue to make good on that statement.
Steve K. asked us to pursue the idea that Enron build a computer system.  
This may be a good way to have significant input while leveraging these 
companies' money and promoting Enron's congestion model ideas, etc.

Sandeep,

This is the list of the groups  that have access to Research directory.
Martin compiled this list.

Please, review it and let's talk about the recommendations regarding

Please find attached an Excel workbook listing different access groups for Research.  I have marked some users for keeping and deleting.  I'm not sure how you wish to proceed.  You can edit the list as you see fit.  Perhaps we can contact those who have particular groups (e.g. Weather) for updates on their list.

I am generally of the opinion that the lists should be as short as possible.  A directory that Lance and I share with the power group was deleted yesterday but nobody knows who did that.  I hope after this audit is done, we are much less at risk of something that like happening again.

Steve, I'm not sure if you remember me, but I was the gentleman that talked 
to you at the Floor Meeting on April 18th for ETS personnel.

If you remember, I mentioned that some of our engineering people had 
transferred to EES last year and that now they all want back due to the mass 
confusion in that organization such as billings being done on Excel 
spreadsheets, no one being allowed to talk to other groups, etc. etc. 

Today, one of these employees, Linda Uselman, paid me a visit to inform me of 
her resignation from EES.  I mentioned to Linda about my discussion with you 
and she said she would very much like to share with you what is going on in 
EES.

Linda was one of our best employees.  While we hated to see her go to EES, we 
thought this was for the good of Enron.  Now we see that everyone lost on 
this deal.

Thanks, Norm

The EPSA leg. affairs cmt. met today during the fall meeting.  The speakers were Howard Useem, Republican counsel to the Senate Energy Committee, and Jimmy Glotfelty, senior policy advisory to the Secretary of Energy.

Useem said Senate Energy Committee Republicans were meeting later this morning to finalize their energy proposal.  (We later learned that they opted against including any electricity provisions, not even the PURPA, PUHCA and reliability issues that Howard thought might be included when he spoke before the senators met; this is good news since it makes it less likely that anti-FERC provisions will be added.) (Howard said now is the best time to legislative on electricity because the Supreme Court has not yet acted on the bundling/unbundling issue.)

On RTOs, in some what of a surprise, Useem said that there is general support among Senate Republicans for RTOs, including consolidating them into a few RTOs of large scope (surprising since this is not what we have heard in meetings with individual Senate offices).  While he said that, he also said that support is stronger in the abstract than in specifics.  He said the biggest opposition was coming from very vocal state regulators (EPSA staff did a good job of pointing to state regulators, mainly in the Midwest, who support larger RTOs).  Most importantly, Howard said none of the senators on his committee take a ""not over my dead body"" approach to RTOs.

Jimmy Glotfelty explained to several EPSA members who asked questions just why it is that the Administration wants Congress to be silent on RTOs.  He said while they would prefer a sentence or two affirming FERC's authority, they do not believe this is what would come out of the legislative process.  They are not willing to run that risk.  He stressed that the president wants to include other electricity issues.  He said they were very close to an agreement with Western governors on regional transmission siting.  

Jimmy further said that the Administration also wants silence on incentive rates, another issue where FERC can act now.  They continue to talk to Barton and his staff in an attempt to get them to back away from the restrictive approach to RTOs in the Barton discussion draft.  (He said Pat Wood spent several hours with Barton and other House committee staff yesterday.)

Of concern, Jimmy said something like ""could be 4 RTOs, could be 8 RTOs,"" what is important is getting standard design.  He also said DOE will make sure that PMAs are included in RTOs.

Subject: RE: Draft of Market rate filing


          Marcus: Here are the others points I wanted to make, just briefly:

                1.  I still think I need to talk to FERC staff before we file.
     Here's why:  
                    - - FERC, as you know, is about to issue a new rule 
                       on market-based rate eligibility.
                    - - In the meantime, they've been kicking out a very 
                      high percentage of MBR applicants for trumped up
                    reasons.  I.e., issuing deficiency letters on issues we 
                    know they don't care about.  I think the real reason 
                    is they don't want to issue a lot of approvals until the 
                    new rule comes out.
                      - -  No matter how perfect our filing is, we're liable
                     to get kicked out, too.  They might not want to give
                     MBR to a new Enron entity until they see the new
                     rule.
                     - -    The best way to deal with that is to sit down with 
                     staff, go over the draft page by page, and see
                     what more they want.  But that would take too long,
                     because of staff's schedule.
                     - -   The second best way is for me to call Dan 
                    Larcamp or Mike Coleman, at FERC; tell them that 
                    we're not in a huge hurry, but we really don't want a
                    deficiency letter; read him the language in the draft
                    about how we'll comply with the new rule, and see if 
                    that's good enough.  If he suggests different 
                    language, we'll have to put it in there.
                     - - Alternatively, if we really want to try to slide this 
                    through without saying anything to FERC in 
                    advance, we can file it, and just hope that the 
                    language we have about complying with the new 
                    rule  is good enough.   But that's really not what I 
                    would recommend. 

         If we do decide to call FERC, I could call right away, and probably get an answer in time to file today.  If not, then certainly tomorrow. Otherwise, we're pretty much ready. 

             2.  I really do think that we could ask for 30 days without raising any eyebrows. 

                                  Good luck, and I'll talk to you soon.

Attached is a mark up of suggested changes to the filing as per my

In addition we will need to confirm whether Sandhills is a subsidiary of
Enron Corp.
We will be adding two contacts from our Regulatory Group.

Marcus,

  The attached revised draft ""fixes"" the ESVL/EVSL error.  Also, we
tried to catch the reference to ENA.  We will work on that further
tomorrow.  I wanted to send this draft to you now, however, so that you
could review it without constantly being distracted by seeing EVSL
throughout the document.  I know that would distract me.  I hope this
helps.

ESVL Corp will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. not Enron
North America Corp. In addition I see that some of the letters have
become transposed and ESVL often reads EVSL.
	
With ESVL Corp being a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. there may
well be other changes that need to be made.
	
Will speak tomorrow.

The draft filing is attached.  We are working on adding headers to the
rate schedule and code of conduct.  

Thank you for the information on New Albany.  I removed all references
to New Albany because we recently worked with Susan, Stuart and Robert
on that transaction.  Also we removed the references to five other
peakers Enron sold recently - we worked with Stuart to get those FERC
approvals.  In addition, we did not include a reference to North
Carolina Power Holdings, L.L.C. made in earlier filings.  We are aware
that Enron received 203 authorization to sell that entity earlier this
year.  We am uncertain about whether that transaction closed but we
assumed it did and removed it but need to confirm with you that it is
appropriate to remove it.  

Thank you for the suggestion about updating the information from the
triennial filing.  We will certainly double check to make sure the
companies we have listed in the attached draft have not been sold.
Also, we refer to exhibit 2 to the triennial filing made on January 14,
2000 rather than listing the names of Enron's generating units with
market-based rate authorization whose output is dedicated under
long-term contracts.  We will confirm that this information is still
accurate as well.  

Thanks again,

Cathy

In addition to Sandhills Enron also made a 203 filing this year in
respect of the sale of the New Albany plant to Duke. You will probably
need to run a check on Enron at FERC to ensure that between us we have
identified any changes to the three year update for EPMI which was
prepared at the beginning of this year.

Here's why: - - FERC, as you know, is about to issue a new rule on market-based rate eligibility. - - In the meantime, they've been kicking out a very high percentage of MBR applicants for trumped up reasons. I.e., issuing deficiency letters on issues we know they don't care about. I think the real reason is they don't want to issue a lot of approvals until the new rule comes out. - - No matter how perfect our filing is, we're liable to get kicked out, too. They might not want to give MBR to a new Enron entity until they see the new rule. - - The best way to deal with that is to sit down with staff, go over the draft page by page, and see what more they want. But that would take too long, because of staff's schedule. - - The second best way is for me to call Dan Larcamp or Mike Coleman, at FERC; tell them that we're not in a huge hurry, but we really don't want a deficiency letter; read him the language in the draft about how we'll comply with the new rule, and see if that's good enough. If he suggests different language, we'll have to put it in there. - - Alternatively, if we really want to try to slide this through without saying anything to FERC in advance, we can file it, and just hope that the language we have about complying with the new rule is good enough. But that's really not what I would recommend. If we do decide to call FERC, I could call right away, and probably get an answer in time to file today. If not, then certainly tomorrow. Otherwise, we're pretty much ready. 2. I really do think that we could ask for 30 days without raising any eyebrows. Good luck, and I'll talk to you soon. >>> ""Nettelton, Marcus"" <Marcus.Nettelton@ENRON.com> 10/30/01 09:35AM >>> Catherine Attached is a mark up of suggested changes to the filing as per my voicemail earlier this morning.

Also we removed the references to five other peakers Enron sold recently - we worked with Stuart to get those FERC approvals. In addition, we did not include a reference to North Carolina Power Holdings, L.L.C. made in earlier filings. We are aware that Enron received 203 authorization to sell that entity earlier this year. We am uncertain about whether that transaction closed but we assumed it did and removed it but need to confirm with you that it is appropriate to remove it.

We will certainly double check to make sure the companies we have listed in the attached draft have not been sold.

RTO Week

=20

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

=20

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices=20

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy =
Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Chr=
istiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC Gene=
ral Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnes=
ota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Co=
mpany.

=20


General Observations


=20

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left la=
te in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, t=
he commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of=
 all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; =
much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seeme=
d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo=
rward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover for=
ward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha=
t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t=
o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was d=
iscussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the=
 reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticea=
ble conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two org=
anizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20

=20


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=
eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =
felt was critical. =20

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panel=
ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=
y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=
ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varie=
d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=
or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=
ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=
followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=
nt situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=
t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=
 throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue =
a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you=
 need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =
wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=
o say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=
 little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=
t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=
he need for cautious investigation. =20

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=
heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=
e ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the que=
stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=
os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =
a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=
ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =
questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=
r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=
s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=
 be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=
edule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=
ing from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are a=
llowed)?=20


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =
services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues=
 to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=
ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=
re those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?=
 Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=
, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=
dules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =
in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary=
 services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=
ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? =
 Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=
ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=
ly unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=
d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =
non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=
reat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=
l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =
to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=
, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will t=
ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financi=
al hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =
about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =
to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=
red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=
on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=
 said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =
believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=
hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=
ion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=
tting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a bea=
uty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=
l short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants cont=
inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=
ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=
SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and=
 did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=
sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were=
 they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=
ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=
g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=
t, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m=
an.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos=
ed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =
likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulti=
ng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments=
 in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show=
 the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=
, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =
talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=
ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=
rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=
omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would=
 say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, t= he commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of= all questions. There was a general consensus that standards were needed; = much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seeme= d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo= rward and how far they needed to go. Panelists urged the need to mover for= ward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha= t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t= o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward. There was d= iscussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the= reins in the future. On an interesting tangential note, there was noticea= ble conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two org= anizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20 =20 FERC Deliverables A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne= eded from the Commission. Staffers probed all panelists to find what they = felt was critical. =20 The first major topic was ""How many RTOs? What is their scope?"" All panel= ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b= y FERC, in strong definitive language. N o one offered any specific langua= ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement. The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?"" Panelists varie= d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent. Some urged f= or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta= ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (= followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre= nt situation. The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha= t the industry needed to move forward. They continually visited this topic= throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue = a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you= need us to provide?"" General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they = wanted strong leadership in this areas. Kormos and Burkes went so far as t= o say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a= little further."" Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu= t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t= he need for cautious investigation. =20 One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc= heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th= e ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the que= stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design. Korm= os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying = a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry. The se= ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following = questions: ? Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu= r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i= s nonetheless efficient? Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there= be others that must be accommodated? ? Transmission Service - Are transmission services required to sch= edule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect= ing from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are a= llowed)?=20 ? Loop Flows - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission = services appropriate? If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues= to be addressed? ? Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr= ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti= re those contracts? Are there other solutions? ? Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?= Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)= , be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche= dules), or will they be required at all? ? Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed = in standard ways? Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary= services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina= ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)? ? Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? = Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce= ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical= ly unwieldy? ? Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate= d into the new world? Should systems be designed with the assumption that = non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO? Or should they be designed to t= reat each NJE as a separate entity? Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica= l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which = to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions= , pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will t= ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financi= al hedging instruments"") will take only months. The Commission asked Mike = about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible = to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed. Now for a funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer= red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati= on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest. Kormos flat out= said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't = believe that that statement is true."" He then backpedaled a bit and said t= hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert= ion by the Northwest interests was false. NERC and GISB A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se= tting organization. Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a bea= uty contest between NERC and GISB?"" Cook and Boswell then went into severa= l short polite jabs at each other's organizations. Other participants cont= inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization. Interesting= ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI= SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and= did not focus on its history. Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a= sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were= they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?). GISB was easily a= ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin= g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin= t, Brownell. Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m= an. He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos= ed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag. If staffers have tenure, they will = likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulti= ng in several filings and interventions. We may also wish to file comments= in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show= the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction. There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues= , but general consensus was that I could not be done. There was also some = talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB. The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur= ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade= rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward. NERC s= omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position. In general, I would= say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top. Let me know if you have any questions.

Your assessment makes perfect sense to me.  What do you think about having 
Nels make the call to Lundquist just to find out what his status is, what he 
might look for when his current assignment is over, etc.  (obviously without 
identifying us -- presumably Nels would have reason to talk to him anyway in 
the normal course of business)?  I am not wedded to the idea but am inclined 
toward at least getting the information, unless you see a problem.

I got your message about Andrew.  He would be an excellent catch.  However, I 
see a couple of significant problems.  My guess is that Andrew is too senior 
for this position, particularly after having chaired the Cheney task force.  
Also, I would not anticipate that he would be available for several months, 
if then.  We should fill this position immediately.  We are already missing 
opportunities because this position is vacant. 

As for our search, using Korn Ferry, I have narrowed the field to two very 
good candidates.   I am setting up time for Rick to interview these 
candidates next Monday.  The first candidate is Drew Maloney with Rep. Tom 
Delay's office.  Drew would give us enormous visibility in House Republican 
leadership circles, seems trustworthy, and capable of learning most of the 
substance of the energy portfolio.  Drew has strong networking skills, which 
I think would nicely fit with Tom's strategic and technical skills.  The 
second candidate is John Shelk, whom I have known for nearly 15 years.  John 
was the lead Republican staff on the House Energy and Commerce Committee 
under Norm Lent.  John left the Committee in 1992.  Since then John has 
worked in the financial services and gaming industries, where he has enhanced 
his political and Republican networking skills.  John in very short order 
would have extremely strong technical skills, atlhough he has been away from 
the industry for eight years.  I believe both candidates bring different but 
very strong talents to the job.  I have a second opening for an enviromental

California Changes Stance on Refunds 
Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks 
By Peter Behr
Washington Post Staff Writer
Friday, July 6, 2001; Page E01 
California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to 
recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity, saying 
they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 
billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year.
Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is 
seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term 
contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for 
Davis. 
""We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get 
us $8.9 billion,"" Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. 
""You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you 
want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion.""
The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a 
California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close 
to the negotiations.
Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the 
amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach 
a compromise.
""What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood,"" Wagner told 
reporters. ""In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I 
may offer a preliminary assessment."" The settlement conference is set to 
conclude on Monday.
Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides 
toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. 
Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California's largest utility, 
drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at 
sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on.
Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn, 
chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid 
manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in 
refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said.
Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for 
all sides, is closed to the public and media.
Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and 
his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a ""joke"" that the 
parties might as well wear ""clown suits,"" according to a Dow Jones report 
confirmed by sources close to the talks.
But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant 
Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for 
failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers 
have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off 
various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said. 
Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's 
commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but 
now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California's 
electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher 
refund figure, some energy analysts believe.
Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an 
overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have 
to pay for energy under those deals.
California's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed 
deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at 
volatile ""spot market"" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so 
did the state's electricity bills. 
In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating 
long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so 
far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power 
for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. 
That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was 
paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and 
considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy 
analysts say.
A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political 
pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's 
controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that 
reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count 
as a ""refund"" because the deals were reached ""under commercial duress,"" 
according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations.
Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. 
""There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be,"" said 
Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. 
The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a ""just and reasonable"" 
standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the 
overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure.
""It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate,"" 
said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight 
committee for the California grid.
Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room 
""billions of dollars apart,"" as the talks approached their final weekend, 
sources said.

All,
Lee asked me to forward this.  I'm still awaiting additional suggestions from
anyone on speakers.

I guess Lee's e-mail changes things.  If the business school wants to go 
forward
with a conference anyway then it may be a bad idea to have a separate one.  
Jeff
has said he likes the idea of coordinating.  Bill and Allen, what do you 
think?
I will chime in that Carl Shapiro is very much a big wig, as a former chief
economist at DOJ.  As for the Frank Wolak suggestion, Frank is a Stanford

anyone else on electricity market design performance, regarding the UK,

If the business school wants to go forward with a conference anyway then it may be a bad idea to have a separate one. Jeff has said he likes the idea of coordinating. Bill and Allen, what do you think? I will chime in that Carl Shapiro is very much a big wig, as a former chief economist at DOJ. As for the Frank Wolak suggestion, Frank is a Stanford economist who is an outstanding analyst and has published probably more than anyone else on electricity market design performance, regarding the UK, Australia, and California.

Charges of Gouging as Power Costs Skyrocket
Energy: Critics say tactics allowed in the deregulated market, which let
suppliers reap big profits, illustrate flaws in the system. As the
state's booming economy taxes the ability to meet electricity demands, a
federal investigation is underway.

   With Southern Californians reeling from skyrocketing electric bills,
critics charge that fewer than a dozen power suppliers are reaping far
greater profits than are justified by the recent surge in wholesale prices
of the natural gas they use to create electricity.



  Their behavior is a major focus of a formal investigation announced
last week by federal regulators. Among those under scrutiny are power
merchants including <B>Duke</B> <B>Energy</B>, <B>Dynegy</B>,
<B>Reliant</B> <B>Energy</B>, Calpine,
Southern Co. and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Critics
say the companies are earning huge windfalls selling energy to the two
state agencies charged with distributing power in California.

   The power merchants themselves deny any profiteering, describing their
market moves as legal business practices and welcoming the investigation.
   The underlying cause of California's energy turmoil is a severe
shortage of power-generating capacity to meet the soaring energy demands
of the state's booming economy. This summer the state at times has had to
import more than 20% of its energy needs, a shortfall equal to the output
of about 20 medium-size power plants. No plants of any size have been
built in the state in 10 years.
   But the problem goes beyond a supply-and-demand imbalance. The
so-called merchant power companies' ability to bend the market to their
advantage--using what appear to be legal strategies--illustrates what
many say are serious flaws in the state's deregulated energy market.
   One major flaw is that sellers do not have to participate in the
state's main electricity auction--the so-called ""day forward"" sale held
one day before electricity is delivered to the state's residences and
businesses. Instead, generators are withholding power until the day of
delivery, when desperate state agencies are willing to pay steep prices
to keep the power flowing.
   The upshot has been a doubling of electric bills for the 1.2 million
customers in San Diego Gas&Electric's coverage area, and Southern
California Edison and Pacific Gas&Electric customers may be facing
higher prices once their rates are unfrozen in 2002.
   There is little prospect for short-term relief; with no additional
power generation due for a year, the prices of natural gas and crude oil
are still rising. In fact, state officials expect the market to become
tighter over the next year as demand and fuel prices rise.
   In pointing the finger at the power merchants, Gov. Gray Davis, some
academics and utility executives charge that California consumers are
being victimized by sophisticated trading techniques that take advantage
of the market system to extract huge profits.
   Deregulation ""only works if people act responsibly. It won't work if
people say their only goal is to make as much money as humanly possible,""
Davis said last week.
   This brokering takes place on the California Power Exchange and the
Independent System Operator, two agencies created by the 1996 legislation
that ostensibly opened up 70% of the state's power market--represented by
the PG&E, SCE and SDG&E service areas--to competition. To create that
competition, lawmakers ordered the utilities to sell power plants to
independent companies, which now are selling electricity to the state.
   The Power Exchange is a clearinghouse for the bulk of energy trading
that is completed a day in advance of delivery, which normally fills most
of the state's energy needs. The ISO, the nominal traffic cop arranging
deliveries over the power grid, also has the authority to hold same-day
power auctions for immediate delivery in the event of unexpectedly high
demand.
   The Power Exchange is subject to a price cap of $250 per
megawatt-hour, a ceiling imposed earlier this summer as prices began to
soar. But the ISO has the authority to pay as much as it has to for
supplementary power if the previous-day purchases prove insufficient to
keep the state's lights on.
   And it is the secondary ISO market where power suppliers, leveraging a
seller's market, are holding sway. By withholding their energy from the
Power Exchange and opting instead to bid their supply to the ISO, they
are betting that same-day shortages will generate prices as close to the
price cap as possible, possibly even above it.
   It's apparently working.
   On some days, the ISO has ended up buying one-fifth of the state's
energy needs, not the 5% to 10% maximum originally envisioned. In the
process, desperate to meet demand, the ISO is paying premium prices and
those prices are being passed along to consumers.
   The problem with the market apparently defies easy solutions. At an
emergency meeting Friday to discuss ways of dealing with the crisis, the
ISO board rejected a staff proposal to force energy merchants to allocate
at least 90% of the electricity they intend to sell in the ""day forward""
auction held by the Power Exchange, instead of holding back until the day
of delivery.
   Although ISO Chief Executive Terry Winter said the measure would
restore some market order, the board rejected it on fears that it might
create unforeseen ramifications, possibly even power suppliers abandoning
the state altogether.
   As the market stands now, independent power companies have been able
to exploit the power shortages and the market's quirks to charge the
state higher rates than the increases in the price of natural gas would
seem to warrant, said Severin Borenstein, a UC Berkeley professor and
energy specialist.
   With fellow UC Berkeley professor James Bushnell and Stanford's Frank
Wolak, Borenstein studied the Power Exchange over a 15-month period ended
in September and found evidence of ""market power,"" or the power
generators' ability to raise prices above competitive levels for
sustained periods.
   Unless there is collusion among two or more power providers, the
exercise of market power is not illegal, experts say. But if prolonged,
it is a symptom of a seriously dysfunctional market.
   ""I think [market power] has probably gotten worse this year. There are
players big enough to move the price and move it a lot. Prices are
clearly way above their costs,"" Borenstein said.
   Edison CEO John Bryson and Stephen Baum, head of SDG&E parent Sempra
Energy, have similar criticisms. Their claims will be investigated by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the latest of five probes underway
into California's worsening energy predicament. ""We'll see whether there
are alternative market rules that should be adopted to have a better
functioning, more efficient market,"" said Daniel Larcamp, FERC's director
of market tariffs and rates. ""Looking at market power issues is an
important focus of our investigation.""
   Power suppliers Duke Energy and Calpine denied any market
manipulation, saying the bulk of their energy is sold on long-term
contracts and is not used to unduly sway day-ahead prices on the Power
Exchange or same-day sales on the ISO.
   ""No way are we manipulating the market, and we have welcomed
investigation into our business practices,"" said Tom Williams, spokesman
for Duke Energy's California regional office in Morro Bay. ""It's easy to
point fingers at someone who controls only 4% of the market, much of
which has already been sold in the forward market months ago.""
   Calpine spokesman Bill Highlander said the high prices are simply a
case of demand far outstripping the state's ability to meet it. ""Ten
years ago, you had more supply than demand. Now you have a skyrocketing
demand from population growth, a robust economy and Internet-fed
additions to demand,"" Highlander said.
   Charles Cicchetti, a USC professor of government, business and the
economy, agrees and said the market is performing exactly as expected,
given supply shortages. He objects to the limited price ceilings opposed
by state officials.
   ""The choice should be to either regulate the whole thing, go back to
where we were or let the market work,"" Cicchetti said. ""This hybrid is
causing problems to get worse.""
   But something appears to be worsening an already bad pricing
situation, and critics believe it is market manipulation. In the FERC
order initiating its investigation, the agency noted that California's
wholesale electricity costs on June 29 were $340 million--a sevenfold
increase over the same date in 1999. Over the same period, natural gas
prices only doubled.
   FERC will look at other aspects of the state's energy deregulation as
well--at the fact that utilities have no choice but to purchase power
from the central power exchange and have only limited power to hedge or
make bilateral deals on their own with outside firms.
   In an interview last week, the FERC's Larcamp said his agency is
reserving the right to roll back rates, order refunds or even impose a
new market framework to replace the Power Exchange and ISO.
   Larcamp said the FERC's probe will contrast California's troubled
power market with the Pennsylvania-Maryland-New Jersey system, which
gives end users more freedom to cut their own deals with suppliers. The
result is that Pennsylvania has more than 130 power suppliers competing
for the state's business, versus no more than 15 in California.

I attended Cmmr. Wood's two-day hearing on Wholesale Markets, which concluded 
today (8/24) in San Diego.  Three Commissioner's were present (Wood, Lynch 
and Neeper) with Duque and Bilas participating by phone.  Administrative Law 
Judge Wetzel was present and a transcript was taken.  The quasi-legislative 
hearing was the beginning of a record developed for the investigation into 
the workings of wholesale/retail markets.  This session focused on Wholesale 
markets.  There will be subsequent sessions on retail issues, market 
structure and other related issues in the future.  My conclusion from this 
session is that Wood is looking for support for increasing regulatory 
intervention in the market.

Dan Larcamp, Director of the Office of markets, Tariffs and Rates, FERC, was 
present.  He relayed FERC's concern of this matter and a desire to hold 
hearings in San Diego.  He also relayed that Hoecker held a press conference 
announcing the opening of a 206 investigative proceeding into the operation 
of the wholesale markets in California, which carried with it refund 
authority.

The format of the hearing was to respond to pre-filed questions developed by 
Wood/Lynch.  Each member of the panel would respond to the questions and any 
questions posed by the Commissioners, the Judge or the CPUC Attorney.  No 
questions were posed by members of the audience.  Yesterday's panel of 
academics were comprised of:

1.  Dr. Timothy Duane-UC Berkley
2.  Dr. William Hogan-Harvard
3.  Dr. Frank Wolak-Stanford (ISO Market Surveillance Committee)
4.  David Marcus-Energy Consultant for the Coaltion of Utility Employees
5.  Dr. Gene Coyle
6.  Dr. Jean-Michel Glachant, Universite Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne

The panel was asked to speak as individuals and not on behalf of any 
institutions they may represent.  While the purpose of the panel seemed to be 
to determine that market power was being exercised and that prices were too 
high and therefore not just and reasonable, the panelist stopped short of 
blaming generators and market participants in behaving illegally.  The 
concensus generally was that market power did exist at various times, but the 
mere existence did not constitute bad behavior.  None, with the exception of 
Dr. Wolak who is in the process of doing a study using recent data as part of 
his role for the Market Surveillance Committee, had done a study.  There was 
some discussion, though not much, of the monopsony power of the utilities.  I 
think ultimately the group conceded that scarcity of supply amplified 
concerns about the exercise of market power, as even the increase in gas 
costs did not fully explain the recent spikes.  Wolak believes that encourage 
utilities to enter into forward purchases will reduce the exercise of 
real-time market power. 

Hogan seemed to be there with Sempra's interests in mind.  He continued to 
promote expansion of the ISO's abilities to dispatch load as well as maintain 
system reliability.  There was alot of discussion about forward purchase 
ability for utilities so as to be less subject to volatile market prices.  
The concerns were also discussed about the appropriateness of a distribution 
utility making purchasing decisions on behalf of its customers.  This 
included discussion of separation of these functions and the default provider 
role.  

Most everyone agreed that rolling back to a regulated market was not feasible 
without raising other major and serious concerns, however there seemed to be 
support for some interim measures where cost-of-service regulation may be a 
good idea and that was during peak periods.  All agreed that a demand 
response, and price signals, are important in the long-run, although not to 
the extent currently experienced in San Diego.

Today's panel included representatives from SDG&E, SCE and PG&E, TURN, UCAN 
and ORA.  

While yesterday's panel maintained objectivity as to whether or not 
generators were exercising market power to the detriment of the system, 
today's panel made no bones about the generators being to blame.

SCE/PG&E indicated their need for relief for recovery of market costs in 
excess of the rate freeze.  SDG&E was still on the hot seat for their 
inaction in hedging any of their supply.  SDG&E brought up their failed PBR 
proposal and ORA and UCAN thought that that may be one way to incent the 
utility to be more responsible with their purchases.

UCAN discussed the Governor's direction and the potential for putting rate 
caps into affect for residential and small commercial.  He mentioned that C&I 
customers are experience difficulties as well.  

TURN raised the need for cost-based bid caps and cost-based peaking 
contracts.  Mike Florio, TURN, urged against any further divestitute of 
assets and alleged market concentration on those assets that had been 
divested.  In fact, TURN urged the Commission to seek legislation to clarify 
the Commission's authority to order retention of assets.

Neeper urged that part of the solution should be changing the current 
requirement to use the PX as the only authorized exchange, although TURN 
disagreed.

Subject: Daily Update/ Legislative activity - 08/24/00

Siting related bills

1. Good new - The Williamson Act passed the Senate 34-1, It should be heard 
at the assembly Saturday or Monday if it is not redirected to a Committee 
hearing.

2. There was a long meeting with Ducheny with regards to AB 970. The enviro's 
boycotted, they want to draft a bill with Keeley. Labor was obstructionist - 
they wanted to gut all the expediting siting  language with regards to all 
facilities except for the peaking plants.  

Rate Cap related bills
1. The Edison Language on Rate Stabilization may not go anywhere. Edison has 
not found an author because of the efforts of Enron and others lobbying 
against it. Furthermore there are signs that Gov. Davis opposes it.

2. The Governor's office has issued a proposed language for a rate cap bill. 
The language however is not available as of yet. It may be released today or 
tomorrow. SDG&E has shown concerns over the content of the bill. They seem to 
think that it is worse than initially proposed by the Governor in his press 
release. 
The bill includes retroactive rate caps through 6/1/00. 
The rate cap could reflect Wood's rate cap proposal (6.5 cts cap on the 
energy component
The bill does not specify who or how the costs associated with the cap will 
be recovered. (The reasoning is that UDCs will be more cautious in their 
procurement if there is uncertainty on who is responsible for the costs.)
All of this is speculative. We hope to see the actual language soon.

3. Enron has been working with the Republican leadership to promote a rate 
cap proposal similar to the amended language we have proposed for AB2290.
The bill focuses only on SDG&E customers and our major principals are the 
following. 
The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to residential and small commercial 
customers, plus specific institutions that have a significant public role, 
such as schools and hospitals.  
The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to the period ending December 31, 2001.
The Interim Rate Cap must be structured so that any undercollection is 
eventually recovered from the same customers who benefit from the lower rates 
provided by the rate cap.  

","Re: Daily Update/ Legislative activity - 08/24/00. I attended Cmmr. Wood's two-day hearing on Wholesale Markets, which concluded today (8/24) in San Diego. Three Commissioner's were present (Wood, Lynch and Neeper) with Duque and Bilas participating by phone. Administrative Law Judge Wetzel was present and a transcript was taken. The quasi-legislative hearing was the beginning of a record developed for the investigation into the workings of wholesale/retail markets. This session focused on Wholesale markets. There will be subsequent sessions on retail issues, market structure and other related issues in the future. My conclusion from this session is that Wood is looking for support for increasing regulatory intervention in the market. Dan Larcamp, Director of the Office of markets, Tariffs and Rates, FERC, was present. He relayed FERC's concern of this matter and a desire to hold hearings in San Diego. He also relayed that Hoecker held a press conference announcing the opening of a 206 investigative proceeding into the operation of the wholesale markets in California, which carried with it refund authority. The format of the hearing was to respond to pre-filed questions developed by Wood/Lynch. Each member of the panel would respond to the questions and any questions posed by the Commissioners, the Judge or the CPUC Attorney. No questions were posed by members of the audience. Yesterday's panel of academics were comprised of: 1. Dr. Timothy Duane-UC Berkley 2. Dr. William Hogan-Harvard 3. Dr. Frank Wolak-Stanford (ISO Market Surveillance Committee) 4. David Marcus-Energy Consultant for the Coaltion of Utility Employees 5. Dr. Gene Coyle 6. Dr. Jean-Michel Glachant, Universite Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne The panel was asked to speak as individuals and not on behalf of any institutions they may represent. While the purpose of the panel seemed to be to determine that market power was being exercised and that prices were too high and therefore not just and reasonable, the panelist stopped short of blaming generators and market participants in behaving illegally. The concensus generally was that market power did exist at various times, but the mere existence did not constitute bad behavior. None, with the exception of Dr. Wolak who is in the process of doing a study using recent data as part of his role for the Market Surveillance Committee, had done a study. There was some discussion, though not much, of the monopsony power of the utilities. I think ultimately the group conceded that scarcity of supply amplified concerns about the exercise of market power, as even the increase in gas costs did not fully explain the recent spikes. Wolak believes that encourage utilities to enter into forward purchases will reduce the exercise of real-time market power. Hogan seemed to be there with Sempra's interests in mind.

The first meeting relative to the SB 27x fix to the suspension of da 
contained in AB 1x was held at the Capitol today.  Present were ESPs, 
consumer groups, business interests, the utlities and representatives from 
the Department of Finance, the DWR and Finance's Bond Counsel.  The meeting 
was led by Laurence Lingbloom from Senator bowen's office.

Aaron Thomas led off with an articualtion of the AReM/business coalition 
proposal. Successive presentations were given by interests who submitted 
either correspondence or draft proposals- the details of which can be 
discussed in tomorrow's conference call.

Of particular note, and the greatest obstacle facing the future of da, was 
the presentation by the attorney representing the Dept. of Finance.  He 
expressed concern over broad exemptions from exit fees (ie: all residential 
and small commercial customers < 100kw) and broad authority to opt out will 
make it extremely difficult to actually sell the bonds.  

We need to follow up with Finance, their counsel and DWR to allay their 
fears- the sooner the better.  We need to be able to speak their language on 
bonding particulars and we need to be able to articulate our position in 
terms relavant to their bonding requirements.  We can discuss this further in 
the call tomorow.

Finally, Lingbloom said he will circulate a proposal of his own by midweek 
next.  The general tenor at the conclusion of the meeting was not good- we 
have our work cut out for us.

Until tomorrow.

Ray Alvarez brought to my attention today a news item indicating that the Congressional Budget Office released a report earlier this week entitled ""Causes and Lessons of the California Electricity Crisis.""  The 30+ page report is available on the home page of the CBO's web site at www.cbo.gov.  I have quickly read through the summary and it is largely favorable.  For example, the summary says:

""Much of the blame for California's electricity crisis attaches to the state's restructuring plan -- but not to its objective, electricity deregulation. (...)  But deregulation itself did not fail; rather, it was never achieved.""

""The restructuring plan did not remove sufficient barriers on both the supply and demand sides of the market to allow competition to work -- in part because it was not designed to.""

""Even without restructuring, California's electric utilities would have faced a difficult challenge in meeting the demand for power and holding down prices in 2000.""

""Consequently, wholesale electricity prices were higher than they probably would have been in either a traditionally regulated market or a more fully deregulated market.""

""Long-term solutions to California's electricity problems will most likely require three changes: removing barriers to the addition of generating capacity, eliminating bottlenecks in the electricity transmission system, and removing regulatory restrictions on the sale of power throughout the broad western market.""

On the negative side, the report summary does state that ""some generators may also have withheld supplies at certain times to boost prices even more"" and ""the plan's auction system for the spot market appears to have created strong incentives for suppliers to bid strategically in a way that raised wholesale prices.""

Michael,

I received today the attached letter from Jonathon Rosenthal of Saybrook
Capital.

Based on the conversation you and I had yesterday, I think that a proper
counter proposal would be to meet in LA, organize a credit committee,
and instruct Saybrook to seek funding from PG&E and SCE.  But, I would
be interested in hearing your thoughts.

Dan Douglass summarized this.  This really puts CA and the ISO on notice that 
they cannot confiscate the power as they seem ready to do -- FERC reiterates 
that the generators can sell power wherever they want because the cap is a 
cap on ISO purchases.  ANd if the ISO want to set a sale price cap it has to 
file with FERC, wait 60 days and amend its contract

Subject: FERC Order on Morgan Stanley Complaint Against ISO


We have good news on the ISO price caps front.  The FERC has made it
clear that ISO does not have the ability to mandate that generators sell to 
ISO at its price caps and that the proper response to inadequate supply is to 
lift the price caps.

On Friday, the FERC issued its Order on Complaint in connection with the July 
10 complaint filed by Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. (""MS"").  As you may 
recall, MS requested FERC to issue a stay of the ISO's maximum purchase price 
authority and to direct the ISO to reverse any price cap reductions.  MS 
sought Fast Track processing pursuant to Rule 206(h), which was granted by 
FERC on the grounds that the complaint ""warrants expeditious action.""

As a quick background summary for you, last November, FERC issued an order 
approving Tariff Amendment 21 which extended ISO's price cap authority 
through 11/15/00.  That order stated that the ISO ""maximum purchase price was 
not a cap on what the seller may charge the ISO, but a cap on what the ISO 
was willing to pay.""  The Commission said that sellers dissatisfied with the 
price cap could ""choose to sell those services into the California Power 
Exchange or bilateral markets.""

FERC notes in Friday's Order that the 6/28 the ISO's Board resolution lowered 
the caps to $500 and ISO further directed that, ""To the extent permitted by 
law, regulation and pre-existing contract, Management shall direct generators 
to bid in all their capacity when system load exceeds 38,000 MW.""

The MS complaint alleged that the cap reduction was unlawful and would, 
""threaten the stability and integroty of the marketplace.""  MS also requested 
an emergency technical conference to examine ISO's justification for the 
price cap reduction.

FERC denied the MS stay request, as well as its request that the $750 maximum 
purchase price be reinstated.  The Commission reiterates that it is not 
approving a cap on sellers' prices, because they can sell at whatever price 
they want.  Rather ISO has simply stated the maximum price it is willing to 
pay.  ""Because sellers are not required to sell to the ISO, the ISO cannot 
dictate their price.""

Importantly, however, FERC also states that, ""ISO has no more or less ability 
to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these services....if 
the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced 
purchase price ceiling (because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they 
choose), it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to 
meet its needs.""  [Emphasis added]  FERC then notes that this may lead to an 
increase in Out of Market (""OOM"") calls and that OOM calls are not subject to 
a maximum purchase price.

Also, with regard to the ISO's resolution stating that generators must bid 
their capacity into the ISO markets when system load exceeds 38,000 MW, FERC 
states clearly that, ""such a requirement is not permitted by our November  12 
Order and the ISO tariff.""  [Emphasis added]

FERC goes on to say that any requirement to sell to ISO in conjunction with a 
maximum purchase price would require significant revisions to ISO's market 
rules, which could not be made effective without a corresponding amendment to 
ISO's tariff.  This would require 60 days' advance notice, ""and could not be 
implemented prior to Commission approval.  As stated above, our November 12 
Order was clearly based on the premise that the proper response to inadequate 
supply (due to a low maximum purchase price) is to raise the maximum purchase 
price.""

ISO is then ""put on notice that any amendment to mandate sales must be 
accompanied by a demonstration that this extreme measure is the proper 
response to low supplies in the ISO markets.""

Concurrences were filed by Commissioners Massey and Hebert.  Massey suggests 
that the state has to facilitate solutions to market issues, such as risk 
management tools, removing constraints on hedging opportunities, introducing 
real time pricing through real time metering and expediting approval of new 
generation and transmission projects in California.  Hebert says that the 
previous November Order tried to ""straddle the fence"" and that, ""Today, the 
Commission at least starts to lean slightly in the right direction of 
recognizing that we have a role.""  He then reiterates his preference for 
removing all price caps.  He also suggests that, ""Getting to the bottom of 
the problem, in my view, requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our 
approval of the ISO as operator of the California grid.  The record supports 
such a move.""  He refers approvingly to the Collins resignation letter, 
stating that it, ""thoughtfully outlines consequences to the market of a 
return to 'command and control.' ""  Hebert states that, ""The independence of 
the ISO's governing structure stands threatened.  We should 'stand up,' to 
quote the resignation letter.""  Hebert advocates opening a section 206 
proceeding now, as part of the recently announced inquiry into bulk power 
markets, ""including the California markets.""

This decision makes it clear that ISO cannot lower the caps at tomorrow's 
meeting and expect that sellers will be required to sell to it at that 
price.  This is an important development and very good news in our ongoing 
efforts to seek economic sanity at the ISO.

Please call if you have any questions.

Dan

Carolyn and Cynthia,

       You should write this letter on your letter head and direct it to Joe
Jaso and copy Tom DeLay, Jim Ellis, and myself. All funds where money could
be left in the State of Texas from corporate and personal should be included.

Dear Joe:

       Enron, Mr. Ken Lay and Mr. Skilling are requesting that their
contribution be matched per our understanding from the fax and verbal
communications from Warren RoBold. This totals $100,000 between both
individuals and the Corporation for the RNSEC matching funds program. We want
these funds matched in time for the Texas State deadlines. It was our
intention from the onset of this program to have our funds go to this
account. The various points of contact from the RNC caused some minor
confusion so checks went to Texas instead of DC. This is very important to
Mr. Lay and Mr. Shilling.
        Let us know if we need to request these funds returned and new checks
written and mailed to you at your DC address. You may call me if you have any
questions.

Two more say Duke withheld power: The company says it was responding to the 
state grid operator.
By Kevin Yamamura
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published July 6, 2001) 
Two more former workers from a Duke Energy power plant came forward Thursday 
to bolster recent claims by colleagues that the power generator withheld 
production to drive up prices. 
But Duke attributed witness accounts of fluctuating generation to 
instructions from the state's transmission-grid operator. 
Richard J. Connors, an auxiliary operator, and E. Robert Edwards, an 
electrician, said generation units at Duke's Chula Vista plant sat idle 
during emergency periods for no apparent reason. 
Three of their former co-workers -- two mechanics and a control room operator 
-- told lawmakers two weeks ago that Duke had disposed of new parts and 
varied its production. 
While that testimony drew significant attention, it was countered Monday by a 
report released by the state's Independent System Operator that showed the 
ISO had in fact ordered Duke's up-and-down output Jan. 16-18. 
On Thursday, the Charlotte, N.C.-based company leaned on the ISO report in 
its defense. 
""The ISO could have dispatched those units at will,"" said Duke spokesman Tom 
Williams, referring to unused equipment. 
But Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, who has filed a lawsuit against generators, 
contended that the ISO had based its orders on Duke's dubious bidding 
history. 
""These ISO orders came only after Duke had continuously manipulated the 
market with price-gouging schemes forcing the ISO to regulate production,"" 
Bustamante said. 
Connors and Edwards each worked more than 20 years at the South Bay plant in 
Chula Vista. 
For most of that time, the plant was owned by San Diego Gas & Electric. Two 
years ago, Duke purchased South Bay and retained Connors and Edwards under 
state-mandated agreements that ended in April. 
Edwards said that during power blackouts in January, he saw a 225-megawatt 
unit off-line. Other units, he said, were operating far below capacity. 
""Our No. 1 priority in life was to make money,"" Edwards said. 
Williams rebutted the claims as observations from those ""who did not have the 
complete picture."" 
""It's dead on, dead true that there are times when that plant is not running 
at full capacity and there is a Stage 3,"" Williams said. ""There may be 
blackouts in San Francisco. But the reason why it's not running is because 
the power can't move up Path 15 (a north-south bottleneck)."" 
Bustamante, however, maintained that Duke has continued to manipulate the 
market, calling Connors and Edwards the ""tip of the iceberg"" in the 
price-gouging investigation. 
State Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, chairman of the Senate committee 
investigating price manipulation, said Connors and Edwards may testify before 
lawmakers after further evaluation. 
Dunn added that his committee has talked to potential whistleblowers from 
other power generators who said they have seen production decreases and 
suspicious activities. It is undetermined whether they will testify, he said.

Lockyer seeks SEC investigation of PG&E's financial transfers 
By Ed Fletcher
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published July 6, 2001) 
State Attorney General Bill Lockyer on Thursday asked the federal Securities 
and Exchange Commission to scrutinize financial transfers made to PG&E Corp. 
from its subsidiary that has filed for bankruptcy protection. 
""SEC scrutiny is essential to protect the public interest, ratepayers and the 
people of the state of California,"" Lockyer said in a prepared statement. 
Charges that PG&E Corp. hastened the bankruptcy filing of Pacific Gas and 
Electric Co. have been made before, responded Greg Pruett, a vice president 
of PG&E Corp. 
""That is an issue that has been investigated multiple times by the Public 
Utilities Commission earlier this year, by an Assembly oversight committee, 
and in each of these audits there has been no conclusion that the transfers 
were inappropriate or that they were injurious to PG&E Co.,"" Pruett said. 
In its filing with the SEC, the attorney general's office said that ""without 
meaningful review by the SEC, it cannot be determined what impact the 
transfer of assets ... may have on the financial condition of the bankrupt 
utility."" 
An SEC spokesman said the commission has yet to examine the petition. 
Among other concerns raised by Lockyer's office is the transfer of more than 
$4 billion from 1997 to 1999 to PG&E Corp. from PG&E Co. 
The majority of the $4 billion came from the sales of PG&E power plants, as 
was required by deregulation. 
""The bulk of the money went to pay debt that was incurred to actually build 
those plants,"" Pruett said. 
The rest of the transfers were to pay stockholder dividends, he said. 
PG&E filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April after having run up 
$6.6 billion in debt.

California State Seeks SEC Probe of PG&E Transfers

California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer on Thursday asked the Securities and 
Exchange Commission to investigate PG&E Corp. for potential abuses of its 
responsibilities as a utility holding company. 
At issue is a series of transactions over the last several years in which 
PG&E Corp. transferred funds from its utility, Pacific Gas & Electric Co., 
which now is operating under Bankruptcy Court protection. The money--more 
than $4 billion since 1997--flowed to the parent company and to unregulated 
sister companies of the utilities. 
The transfers have been scrutinized by the California Public Utilities 
Commission and the state Legislature with no finding of wrongdoing, said PG&E 
Corp. spokesman Greg S. Pruett. 
The SEC currently exempts PG&E from almost all requirements of the Public 
Utility Holding Company Act because the San Francisco utility operates 
primarily within California . That law regulates transactions between holding 
companies and their utility subsidiaries. 
Lockyer wants the SEC to withdraw PG&E's exemption, citing $13 billion in 
PG&E assets outside of California . 
""All the primary evils addressed by PUHCA are relevant to PG&E Corp.,"" 
Lockyer's petition to the SEC stated. 
In Bankruptcy Court on Thursday, PG&E said it is close to reaching an 
agreement with Calpine Corp. to pay more than $267 million it owes the San 
Jose-based power generator and to preserve contracts for 453 megawatts of 
relatively cheap electricity . 
In all, PG&E buys about 2,600 megawatts of electricity from nearly 25 
alternative generators, which are seeking repayment and release from their 
contracts through Bankruptcy Court.

THE NATION Little Progress on Energy Rebate, Judge Hints

WASHINGTON -- The federal mediator seeking a settlement for billions of 
dollars in alleged electricity overcharges in California signaled Thursday 
that the talks are in trouble, and analysts said hope for a deal seems to be 
fading. 
Curtis L. Wagner Jr., chief judge of the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission, said he may issue a report on the closed-door talks as early as 
today if he sees no progress. 
""The judge will perhaps issue a preliminary assessment of the talks,"" said 
Tamara Young-Allen, a spokeswoman for FERC. ""He will do this only if he feels 
the talks aren't moving along as he sees fit."" 
Originally, a preliminary report from the judge was not part of the plan. 
Wagner had previously said all sides would labor in private through the 
weekend to try to get a deal by Monday's midnight deadline. If that failed, 
the judge said he would take seven days to craft a proposed settlement for 
FERC's governing board. 
Kit Konolige, a power industry analyst with Morgan Stanley in New York, said 
Wagner's announcement on Thursday amounted to a judicial distress signal. 
""The judge wouldn't say something like this if the parties were close to a 
settlement,"" said Konolige. ""I suppose he may be trying to jump-start things, 
but I think most people believed the sides were so far apart going into the 
talks that it seemed like a long way to go to reach a settlement."" 
Although Wagner has imposed a gag order on participants, several people with 
knowledge of the negotiations said Thursday that major power generators and 
California officials have not budged from dug-in positions since the talks 
began last week. 
They also said the judge is extremely frustrated with the state and with 
several large power suppliers. 
California is demanding $9 billion in refunds. According to sources, the 
generators have offered less than $1 billion. And some major power sellers 
are insisting they do not owe anything. 
Many experts say California has little hope of obtaining the $9 billion since 
only $5.4 billion of that is attributable to sellers under FERC's 
jurisdiction. On the other hand, it seems clear from statements by FERC 
commissioners that the board is prepared to extract significant refunds from 
generators. 
Wagner is said to be probing for a compromise figure between $1 billion and 
$9 billion. It could take the form of a mix of cash payments and discounts on 
long-term contracts for power. 
FERC's governing board ordered Wagner to hold the talks to see if a 
compromise could be struck on three big issues: refunds, guarantees that 
generators will be paid, and ways to shift more of the state's power 
purchases to long-term contracts. 
The board also made clear that it would impose its own settlement if the 
state and power sellers were unable to come to an agreement. 
Wagner said Thursday that if he issues a preliminary report today, he will 
give all the parties a chance to respond publicly on Monday. Such a report 
might embarrass some of the key players, since Wagner is known for his 
plain-spoken conclusions. The judge would then prepare a settlement 
recommendation for the FERC board by July 16. 
However, he also said he is willing to work through the weekend to reach a 
settlement if it appears within striking distance. 
The talks are in a large hearing room on the second floor of the FERC 
building near Washington's Union Station. Access is strictly controlled and 
special badges have been issued to the more than 140 lawyers participating. 
Some people with knowledge of the negotiations said Wagner's threat to issue 
a report may be a bid to see if one of the parties will make a move. 
""It was like a shot across the bow,"" said one source.

Davis energy team denied pay 
State controller says work for Edison is a conflict of interest

Sacramento -- State Controller Kathleen Connell is refusing to pay two former 
Clinton- Gore campaign operatives hired by Gov. Gray Davis, even though one 
of the consultants dropped his Southern California Edison contract amid 
conflict-of- interest allegations. 
Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane were collectively known as the ""Masters of 
Disaster"" for their work in the Clinton White House during various federal 
investigations. They also worked for Vice President Al Gore during the 2000 
presidential campaign. 
Because of their work for Davis, Connell says the contract Fabiani and Lehane 
signed with Edison is a conflict of interest under state ethics rules. Davis 
is negotiating with Edison on a bailout for the utility. 
Late last week, at the bottom of a press release, Davis announced that 
Fabiani was no longer a communications consultant because his work had been 
""successfully implemented."" Lehane, on the other hand, has dropped his 
contract with Edison and signed a new agreement with Davis. 
Lehane's new contract includes reimbursement for travel and meal expenses, 
which he didn't have before, and requires him to work a maximum of 66 hours a 
month at $150 an hour. His total payments are capped at $76,000 for work from 
June 26 to Nov. 20, 2001. 
In his release, Davis said Lehane would be paid the same amount as former 
communications director Phil Trounstine, about $9,900 a month. But Connell, 
like Davis a Democrat, said Trounstine undoubtedly worked more than 66 hours 
in a month for his $9,990. 
""We don't intend to be paying it,"" Connell said of the contract for both men. 
""They represented Southern California Edison. You have to have a singular 
relationship with the state of California and not show a conflict."" 
Previously, the Davis administration said there was no conflict because 
Edison and Davis wanted the same things out of their negotiations. Earlier 
this week, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said attorneys had different 
opinions over whether the two consultants had violated ethics rules. 
Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said the governor had signed an executive 
order allowing him to enter into consulting contracts with anyone he believed 
could help him solve the state's energy crisis. She said Lehane had been 
working full-time on public policy, even though his contract caps his salary. 
The National Tax-Limitation Committee, a Sacramento group that mostly 
monitors legislation, sued last month alleging that Fabiani and Lehane were 
violating the state Political Reform Act because of the Edison contract. 
In a recently filed disclosure statement, Fabiani also listed more than $10, 
000 worth of consulting work for Cisco Systems, another company that 
frequently brings issues before state authorities, including Davis. 
The state Fair Political Practices Commission also is looking into a 
complaint filed by GOP Secretary of State Bill Jones that Fabiani and Lehane 
violated state ethics rules.

Ex-staff speaks out against Duke 
Two more charge prices manipulated 
Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau
Friday, July 6, 2001

N122949.DTL 
Sacramento -- Two more former employees at Duke Energy's Chula Vista power 
plant came forward yesterday with allegations that the company manipulated 
the energy market to drive up prices, although they offered no hard proof and 
little new information. 
Their accusations bring to five the number of Duke plant workers who say they 
observed suspicious behavior, including the disappearance of parts needed for 
repairs, the idling of generators for no apparent reason, and continual 
stopping and starting that critics of Duke suspect was designed to withhold 
power and artificially increase prices. 
E. Robert Edwards, a 50-year-old electrician, related one conversation with a 
Duke foreman sometime in January that prompted suspicion. 
""I asked the foreman why Unit 4 wasn't running,"" Edwards said yesterday at a 
press conference. ""We had a 225-megawatt generator sitting there, and he just 
shrugged his shoulders and said, 'I really can't tell you. I'm not privy to 
that information.' "" 
State lawmakers have been focusing on whether Duke manipulated prices during 
three days in January, when the company at one point offered a single 
megawatt of power for a record-shattering $3,880. Duke says it was following 
orders from the Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power 
grid, 
when it repeatedly turned its generators on and off during those three days. 
An ISO memo recently released by Duke confirms the company's contention it 
was under orders. But January logs from the ISO and the generators don't 
offer an explanation for every allegation of price manipulation, since Duke 
has refused to release a detailed list of the prices it offered and paid 
during that period. 
The two workers who came forward yesterday, Edwards and 46-year-old Richard 
J. Connors, both worked more than 20 years in the business. They left the 
South Bay Plant in Chula Vista in April, two years after Duke purchased it 
from San Diego Gas & Electric as part of deregulation. 
SOME SHIFTS UNPOPULAR
""It is true units were taken offline, mostly on the weekends for whatever 
reason,"" said Connors, a former auxiliary operator. ""It got to the point as 
an operator that you were dreading working swing shifts on Sunday or 
graveyard Monday morning because you knew you were going to be running around 
putting units back online."" 
Edwards said he had seen a company warehouse eventually emptied of parts that 
are used to repair broken generators, although he didn't know where the parts 
went. Forcing a longer wait for repair parts was designed to dry up the power 
supply and push prices higher, lawmakers and other investigators suspect. 
Edwards, however, admitted the warehouse was being cleaned out even when 
SDG&E ran the plant. Duke contends the workers weren't familiar with Duke's 
inventory system and couldn't possibly know why parts were being moved. 
Duke and other energy companies are facing scrutiny by two legislative 
committees, a 19-member Sacramento County grand jury, state Attorney General 
Bill Lockyer, the California Public Utilities Commission and federal 
regulators. 
BUSTAMANTE ALSO SUING
Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, who introduced Edwards and Connors yesterday, also 
is suing a variety of generators in state court for alleged price 
manipulation and bad business practices. He said Edwards and Connors 
""reiterated what we've know all along -- Duke has been gouging California 
consumers through its use and abuse of the South Bay Plant."" 
Duke offers a variety of defenses for its actions during the three days in 
January and throughout the energy crisis. Tom Williams, a spokesman for Duke, 
said Edwards and Connors had offered nothing new yesterday. 
Beyond the ISO's 37 separate orders to stop and start generators during the 
three days in January, Williams said state air regulations required the 
company to shut the plant at certain times because it was running out of 
emissions credits that limit the amount of air pollution it can put out. 
Duke, which controls about 5 percent of the state energy market, also 
contends the state's power transmission lines can't always handle an increase 
in load. 
""Yes, it's true there are times when that plant is not running at full 
capacity, and there is a Stage Three (alert), and there may be blackouts in 
San Francisco,"" Williams said. ""The reason why it's not running is the power 
cannot move up Path 15,"" the transmission line bottleneck near Los Banos.

Vallejo to produce its own energy 
Conservation, generators expected to make city self-sufficient

Vallejo leaders, looking to escape mounting gas and electric bills, are 
planning to build enough new power generators that the city government will 
be self-sufficient when it comes to energy. 
City officials said they believe that Vallejo is the first city in the nation 
to take such an approach. 
""This is going to be a showplace,"" said Scott Sossen, the chief executive 
officer of Edge Capital Group, a funding agency based in Orange County. Edge 
will be supervising the work along with O'Hara Energy Corp. of Nevada. 
The plan comes at a time when the city expects to see its energy costs double 
next year if it continues buying its power from PG&E. 
""It couldn't be more timely,"" said Mayor Tony Intintoli. 
Vallejo leaders are in the process of contracting with private business to 
build new wind, solar and microturbine generators. Construction of a one- 
megawatt solar generator could start within 30 to 60 days. 
Conservation is also part of the plan, and energy-efficiency improvements are 
already under way at Vallejo City Hall and the fire and police stations. 
City officials hope to add enough sources of power generation to make all 
city offices -- which consume about 10 megawatts a year -- self-sufficient by 
the end of the year. 
The Vallejo City Council gave tentative approval to the project late last 
month and will continue its discussions on the plan next week. 
Vallejo taxpayers won't have to pay any money in advance, because Edge will 
finance the project's first $50 million in capital costs. 
In return, a portion of the city's projected financial savings will be shared 
with the Edge and O'Hara. 
""This is a fairly sizable project,"" said Kevin Chambers, the chief executive 
officer at O'Hara. ""Energy-efficient capital is difficult to find because it 
is such a new field."" 
O'Hara is installing high-tech energy management systems at all city-owned 
property to reduce energy consumption. Final sites for the construction of 
new wind, solar and microturbine generators have not been chosen. 
In recent years, the energy bill for Vallejo city government has averaged 
between $2 million and $3 million per year. That includes the police and fire 
departments, City Hall and water-pumping stations. 
Vallejo is part of a group of 50 local governments in Northern California 
that pooled their resources to buy electricity and natural gas, keeping 
prices down. But the group's current contract expires Dec. 30. 
As a result, the city expects its energy bill to double next year, from 9.2 
cents per kilowatt hour to 20 cents per kilowatt hour. 
""It's been very positive what we've been doing, and it hasn't cost us 
anything,"" said City Manager David Martinez. ""We're going to be very 
optimistic that this is going to be a good thing for the city."" 
City officials hope to eventually extend the plan to Vallejo's 4,500 
businesses and 37,000 households.

SEC asked to see if PG&E Corp. violated law with subsidiary 
Published Friday, July 6, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News 
BY JENNIFER BJORHUS 

Mercury News 


California Attorney General Bill Lockyer asked the federal Securities and 
Exchange Commission on Thursday to step in to investigate whether PG&E Corp. 
violated federal law in taking billions of dollars from its bankrupt 
subsidiary. 
``SEC scrutiny is essential to protect the public interest, ratepayers and 
the people of the state of California,'' Lockyer said in a statement. 
More than $4 billion flowed from the Pacific Gas & Electric utility to parent 
PG&E Corp. from 1997 to 1999, according to Lockyer's petition, representing 
nearly 70 percent of the cash that flowed to the parent company during that 
period. PG&E Corp. spent $2.7 billion to buy back its stock, $1.5 billion to 
pay dividends to shareholders and invested $800 million in its other 
subsidiaries, according to the petition filed Thursday in Washington. 
Those figures are similar to figures from a state-ordered independent audit 
of PG&E Corp.'s finances released in late January. 
By moving assets from the utility to other businesses, the company 
potentially harmed the utility and violated the federal Public Utility 
Holding Company Act in several ways, according to the petition. 
The SEC is the nation's top cop for publicly held companies. But the 
commission has not reviewed PG&E Corp.'s asset movements, saying the company 
is exempt from scrutiny under the Public Utility Holding Company Act because 
it's mainly a California operation and such intrastate operations are exempt. 
The attorney general's office argues that PG&E Corp., with more than $13 
billion of its assets outside the state, can no longer claim it is primarily 
an intrastate company. The SEC should step in, it argues. 
The petition surprised PG&E Corp. officials, who said they had no idea the 
attorney general's office had an issue with the company's exemption from the 
federal law, said company spokesman Greg Pruett. 
Pruett said PG&E Corp.'s actions were appropriate because the federal utility 
law only applies if a company has one or more of the following activities in 
several states: electric transmission and distribution, gas distribution or 
utility-owned generation. 
``We have none of those things except in California,'' Pruett said, adding 
that the National Energy Group, a PG&E Corp. affiliate, ``has natural gas 
transmission but no distribution.'' 
``The power plants that NEG owns or operates are not part of a utility and 
thus aren't regulated by PUCHA, and it has an energy-trading arm that is also 
not regulated by PUCHA,'' he said. 
The petition further asks the SEC to order PG&E Corp. to cooperate fully with 
the California Public Utilities Commission. The state commission is 
investigating whether PG&E Corp.'s corporate structure and its relationship 
with its bankrupt utility violate state utility regulations. 
The petition states it expects a response from the SEC within 60 days. 
But SEC spokesman John Heine said there's no statutory deadline for a 
response. He said he had not seen the petition and could not comment.

Judge may speed up electricity refund talks

Los Angeles Times 


WASHINGTON -- A federal mediator seeking a settlement for billions of dollars 
in alleged electricity overcharges in California signaled Thursday that the 
talks are in trouble. 
Curtis L. Wagner Jr., chief judge of the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission, said he may issue a report on the closed-door talks as early as

Davis keeps state addicted to fossil fuels 
Published Friday, July 6, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News 
BY JOE COSTELLO 
BEFORE this year's energy ``crisis,'' Gray Davis wanted to be known as the 
education governor. However, Davis and his advisers' energy teachings have 
revealed alarming failures, setting back state energy policy not one or two 
years, but one or two decades. 
While George W. Bush proposed an energy policy tied to fossil fuels, 
disproportionate building of centralized generation plants, too little energy 
efficiency, lowering environmental standards and increased global warming 
emissions, Davis enacted it. 
First, Davis has tied the state for the next decade or longer to contracts 
with facilities that are exclusively fossil fuel generation. Second, he has 
encouraged an unprecedented surge in the building of new centralized fossil 
fuel plants. Finally, he has pushed the lowering of environmental standards 
to increase production from the dirtiest fossil fuel facilities. 
The state's new energy purchasing department has spent zero on renewable 
generation. David Freeman, the governor's energy czar, giving lip service to 
alternatives, has negotiated close to $50 billion in long-term contracts with 
fossil fuel generators. 
By comparison, the governor has authorized investment of only $13 million in 
expanding solar generation. Photovoltaic cells produce electricity directly 
from the sun's energy, offering a clean, efficient solution to the state's 
future peak energy demand. While the governor talks a lot about energy 
efficiency, the state's funding of demand programs is about 1 percent of the 
funding for supply. Most egregious, the vast majority of state energy 
efficiency money is funneled back to the utilities. 
While environmentalists deride the Bush administration proposals, in 
California organizations such as the Natural Resources Defense Council 
actively support Davis' fossil fuel energy policy. 
The Davis energy policy has stuck California with the same old electric 
system for at least the next decade. Money has literally been burned instead 
of invested in innovation and creation of a cleaner and more efficient 
system. The best hedge against price spikes is a diversity of fuel sources, 
unfortunately California's electric system is now tied to an even greater 
degree to fossil fuels. 
After binding the state economy to the past, the Davis end game is logical. 
Davis and his energy advisers want to spend tens of billions of dollars for 
the utilities' restoration -- the very companies that for so long stifled 
industry innovation and remain most responsible for California's energy 
fiasco. 
There is still an opportunity to make the best out of a bad situation. 
Instead of bailing out the utilities, they should be dismantled and sold off. 
A combination of a dozen or so local government and publicly owned companies 
should be created with a goal of innovating the industry. An auction could be 
held that would sell customer blocks and with it the state's long-term 
contracts. Choice should be reinstated with the lifting of the suspension on 
direct access to alternative suppliers. 
Instead of moving the state to the next level of energy development, the 
education governor's remedial energy teachings will force California to 
repeat its energy lessons.

Business 
Economics fuels power solution in California Price relief gains political 
support
Robert Gibbons, BridgeNews

(Copyright 2001 by the Chicago Tribune) 
Political pressure coming from the U.S. Congress and politicians from Western 
states seems to have influenced the approach to the power crisis, despite 
opposition to price caps in the Bush administration. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in June expanded price mitigation 
measures on wholesale electricity sales in California during periods when 
blackouts are possible. 
The measures encourage generators to sell power into the state to prevent 
emergency alerts from being declared, which trigger price caps. The move came 
with support growing in Congress, especially among representatives of Western 
states on both sides of the aisle, for legislation that would have capped 
wholesale prices in the region. 
The macroeconomic force may have been the difference between the $7 billion 
cost of power for California in 1999 and its rise to approximately $27 
billion in 2000. The cost is estimated to reach between $50 billion and $70 
billion in 2001. 
With that kind of money at stake, suddenly the concern becomes less a 
question of who is responsible for the problem, but rather, how it can be 
solved quickly to prevent harsh political consequences. 
California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer has conducted an investigation into the 
actions of power generators and offered multimillion dollar rewards to 
whistleblowers to provide evidence of price manipulation by independent power 
generators. The state is seeking refunds of $8.9 billion, the amount it 
estimates independent power generators overcharged California 's troubled 
utilities. 
The U.S. General Accounting Office has released a report criticizing the FERC 
for not finding evidence of power generators using plant outages to drive up 
prices in California . 
""FERC's [February] study was not thorough enough to support its overall 
conclusion that audited companies were not physically withholding electricity 
supply to influence prices,"" the GAO found. 
Of the major independent power generators and marketers, like Reliant Energy, 
Dynegy, Duke Energy and Enron, only Williams and its CEO Keith Bailey came 
out in April in favor of some sort of short- term price relief for California 
. 
""The political dynamic out there is much more Draconian than what we're

Financial 
California Changes Stance on Refunds; Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks

California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to 
recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity , saying 
they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 
billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. 
Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is 
seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term 
contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for 
Davis. 
""We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get 
us $8.9 billion,"" Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. 
""You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you 
want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion."" 
The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a 
California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close 
to the negotiations. 
Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the 
amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach 
a compromise. 
""What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood,"" Wagner told 
reporters. ""In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I 
may offer a preliminary assessment."" The settlement conference is set to 
conclude on Monday. 
Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides 
toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. 
Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility, 
drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at 
sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. 
Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn, 
chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid 
manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in 
refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said. 
Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for 
all sides, is closed to the public and media. 
Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and 
his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a ""joke"" that the 
parties might as well wear ""clown suits,"" according to a Dow Jones report 
confirmed by sources close to the talks. 
But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant 
Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for 
failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers 
have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off 
various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said. 
Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's 
commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but 
now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's 
electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher 
refund figure, some energy analysts believe. 
Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an 
overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have 
to pay for energy under those deals. 
California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed 
deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at 
volatile ""spot market"" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so 
did the state's electricity bills. 
In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating 
long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so 
far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power 
for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. 
That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was 
paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and 
considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy 
analysts say. 
A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political 
pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's 
controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that 
reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count 
as a ""refund"" because the deals were reached ""under commercial duress,"" 
according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. 
Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. 
""There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be,"" said 
Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. 
The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a ""just and reasonable"" 
standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the 
overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. 
""It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate,"" 
said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight 
committee for the California grid. 
Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room 
""billions of dollars apart,"" as the talks approached their final weekend, 
sources said.

U.S. Hearing Officer May Impose Pact
To End California Power-Overcharge Case

WASHINGTON -- With settlement talks apparently stalled, a federal hearing 
officer said he may propose his own solution to settle billions in alleged 
electricity overcharges tied to the California power crisis. 
Curtis L. Wagner Jr. said he was still ""optimistic"" California officials and 
several power companies could come to terms on $8.9 billion in disputed 
electricity charges the state has incurred over the past year. 
Absent more-meaningful progress, he said he would offer his own ""preliminary 
assessment"" and recommendation as soon as today. 
In that event, Mr. Wagner also said, he would convene a hearing Monday where 
the two sides would be given the chance to comment on his plans. Mr. Wagner 
has previously indicated he feels California is due some refunds, but far 
less than the total the state claims. California is also indebted to the 
power companies for billions in previous deliveries; those debts could at 
least partially offset any refunds. Mr. Wagner has also said long-term 
contracts that would insulate the state from the sort of price shocks it has 
experienced over the past year could be part of any resolution. 
An administrative-law judge with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 
Mr. Wagner was named by the panel two weeks ago to broker a peace of the 
overcharge dispute. 
Commission officials have given the parties until Monday to reach an 
agreement behind closed doors. After that, absent a settlement, the 
commission has ordered Mr. Wagner to report back with his findings and 
recommendations within a week. 
At that point, the commission has said it will impose a settlement of its own 
liking. 
The overcharge issue has been a flash point in the California debacle, with 
the state's governor, Gray Davis, calling the energy companies ""pirates"" and 
""marauders."" 
The industry considers itself a scapegoat for a bungled state deregulation 
effort.

By Kevin Yamamura Bee Capitol Bureau (Published July 6, 2001) Two more former workers from a Duke Energy power plant came forward Thursday to bolster recent claims by colleagues that the power generator withheld production to drive up prices. But Duke attributed witness accounts of fluctuating generation to instructions from the state's transmission-grid operator. Richard J. Connors, an auxiliary operator, and E. Robert Edwards, an electrician, said generation units at Duke's Chula Vista plant sat idle during emergency periods for no apparent reason. Three of their former co-workers -- two mechanics and a control room operator -- told lawmakers two weeks ago that Duke had disposed of new parts and varied its production. While that testimony drew significant attention, it was countered Monday by a report released by the state's Independent System Operator that showed the ISO had in fact ordered Duke's up-and-down output Jan. 16-18. On Thursday, the Charlotte, N.C.-based company leaned on the ISO report in its defense. ""The ISO could have dispatched those units at will,"" said Duke spokesman Tom Williams, referring to unused equipment. But Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, who has filed a lawsuit against generators, contended that the ISO had based its orders on Duke's dubious bidding history. ""These ISO orders came only after Duke had continuously manipulated the market with price-gouging schemes forcing the ISO to regulate production,"" Bustamante said. Connors and Edwards each worked more than 20 years at the South Bay plant in Chula Vista. For most of that time, the plant was owned by San Diego Gas & Electric. Two years ago, Duke purchased South Bay and retained Connors and Edwards under state-mandated agreements that ended in April. Edwards said that during power blackouts in January, he saw a 225-megawatt unit off-line. Other units, he said, were operating far below capacity. ""Our No. 1 priority in life was to make money,"" Edwards said. Williams rebutted the claims as observations from those ""who did not have the complete picture."" ""It's dead on, dead true that there are times when that plant is not running at full capacity and there is a Stage 3,"" Williams said. ""There may be blackouts in San Francisco. But the reason why it's not running is because the power can't move up Path 15 (a north-south bottleneck)."" Bustamante, however, maintained that Duke has continued to manipulate the market, calling Connors and Edwards the ""tip of the iceberg"" in the price-gouging investigation. State Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, chairman of the Senate committee investigating price manipulation, said Connors and Edwards may testify before lawmakers after further evaluation. Dunn added that his committee has talked to potential whistleblowers from other power generators who said they have seen production decreases and suspicious activities. It is undetermined whether they will testify, he said. The Bee's Kevin Yamamura can be reached at (916) 326-5542 or kyamamura@sacbee.com. Lockyer seeks SEC investigation of PG&E's financial transfers By Ed Fletcher Bee Capitol Bureau (Published July 6, 2001) State Attorney General Bill Lockyer on Thursday asked the federal Securities and Exchange Commission to scrutinize financial transfers made to PG&E Corp. from its subsidiary that has filed for bankruptcy protection. ""SEC scrutiny is essential to protect the public interest, ratepayers and the people of the state of California,"" Lockyer said in a prepared statement. Charges that PG&E Corp. hastened the bankruptcy filing of Pacific Gas and Electric Co. have been made before, responded Greg Pruett, a vice president of PG&E Corp. ""That is an issue that has been investigated multiple times by the Public Utilities Commission earlier this year, by an Assembly oversight committee, and in each of these audits there has been no conclusion that the transfers were inappropriate or that they were injurious to PG&E Co.,"" Pruett said. In its filing with the SEC, the attorney general's office said that ""without meaningful review by the SEC, it cannot be determined what impact the transfer of assets ... may have on the financial condition of the bankrupt utility."" An SEC spokesman said the commission has yet to examine the petition. Among other concerns raised by Lockyer's office is the transfer of more than $4 billion from 1997 to 1999 to PG&E Corp. from PG&E Co. The majority of the $4 billion came from the sales of PG&E power plants, as was required by deregulation. ""The bulk of the money went to pay debt that was incurred to actually build those plants,"" Pruett said. The rest of the transfers were to pay stockholder dividends, he said. PG&E filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April after having run up $6.6 billion in debt. The Bee's Ed Fletcher can be reached at (916) 326-5548 or efletcher@sacbee.com. Business; Financial Desk California State Seeks SEC Probe of PG&E Transfers NANCY RIVERA BROOKS ? 07/06/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page C-2 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer on Thursday asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate PG&E Corp. for potential abuses of its responsibilities as a utility holding company. At issue is a series of transactions over the last several years in which PG&E Corp. transferred funds from its utility, Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which now is operating under Bankruptcy Court protection. The money--more than $4 billion since 1997--flowed to the parent company and to unregulated sister companies of the utilities. The transfers have been scrutinized by the California Public Utilities Commission and the state Legislature with no finding of wrongdoing, said PG&E Corp. spokesman Greg S. Pruett. The SEC currently exempts PG&E from almost all requirements of the Public Utility Holding Company Act because the San Francisco utility operates primarily within California . That law regulates transactions between holding companies and their utility subsidiaries. Lockyer wants the SEC to withdraw PG&E's exemption, citing $13 billion in PG&E assets outside of California . ""All the primary evils addressed by PUHCA are relevant to PG&E Corp.,"" Lockyer's petition to the SEC stated. In Bankruptcy Court on Thursday, PG&E said it is close to reaching an agreement with Calpine Corp. to pay more than $267 million it owes the San Jose-based power generator and to preserve contracts for 453 megawatts of relatively cheap electricity . In all, PG&E buys about 2,600 megawatts of electricity from nearly 25 alternative generators, which are seeking repayment and release from their contracts through Bankruptcy Court. National Desk THE NATION Little Progress on Energy Rebate, Judge Hints RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR ? 07/06/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page A-30 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company WASHINGTON -- The federal mediator seeking a settlement for billions of dollars in alleged electricity overcharges in California signaled Thursday that the talks are in trouble, and analysts said hope for a deal seems to be fading. Curtis L. Wagner Jr., chief judge of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said he may issue a report on the closed-door talks as early as today if he sees no progress. ""The judge will perhaps issue a preliminary assessment of the talks,"" said Tamara Young-Allen, a spokeswoman for FERC. ""He will do this only if he feels the talks aren't moving along as he sees fit."" Originally, a preliminary report from the judge was not part of the plan. Wagner had previously said all sides would labor in private through the weekend to try to get a deal by Monday's midnight deadline. If that failed, the judge said he would take seven days to craft a proposed settlement for FERC's governing board. Kit Konolige, a power industry analyst with Morgan Stanley in New York, said Wagner's announcement on Thursday amounted to a judicial distress signal. ""The judge wouldn't say something like this if the parties were close to a settlement,"" said Konolige. ""I suppose he may be trying to jump-start things, but I think most people believed the sides were so far apart going into the talks that it seemed like a long way to go to reach a settlement."" Although Wagner has imposed a gag order on participants, several people with knowledge of the negotiations said Thursday that major power generators and California officials have not budged from dug-in positions since the talks began last week. They also said the judge is extremely frustrated with the state and with several large power suppliers. California is demanding $9 billion in refunds. According to sources, the generators have offered less than $1 billion. And some major power sellers are insisting they do not owe anything. Many experts say California has little hope of obtaining the $9 billion since only $5.4 billion of that is attributable to sellers under FERC's jurisdiction. On the other hand, it seems clear from statements by FERC commissioners that the board is prepared to extract significant refunds from generators. Wagner is said to be probing for a compromise figure between $1 billion and $9 billion. It could take the form of a mix of cash payments and discounts on long-term contracts for power. FERC's governing board ordered Wagner to hold the talks to see if a compromise could be struck on three big issues: refunds, guarantees that generators will be paid, and ways to shift more of the state's power purchases to long-term contracts. The board also made clear that it would impose its own settlement if the state and power sellers were unable to come to an agreement. Wagner said Thursday that if he issues a preliminary report today, he will give all the parties a chance to respond publicly on Monday. Such a report might embarrass some of the key players, since Wagner is known for his plain-spoken conclusions. The judge would then prepare a settlement recommendation for the FERC board by July 16. However, he also said he is willing to work through the weekend to reach a settlement if it appears within striking distance. The talks are in a large hearing room on the second floor of the FERC building near Washington's Union Station. Access is strictly controlled and special badges have been issued to the more than 140 lawyers participating. Some people with knowledge of the negotiations said Wagner's threat to issue a report may be a bid to see if one of the parties will make a move. ""It was like a shot across the bow,"" said one source. * RELATED STORIES Energy savers: College students help businesses cut waste. B1 SEC probe: The state urges a review of PG&E fund transfers.

Gray Davis, even though one of the consultants dropped his Southern California Edison contract amid conflict-of- interest allegations. Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane were collectively known as the ""Masters of Disaster"" for their work in the Clinton White House during various federal investigations. They also worked for Vice President Al Gore during the 2000 presidential campaign. Because of their work for Davis, Connell says the contract Fabiani and Lehane signed with Edison is a conflict of interest under state ethics rules. Davis is negotiating with Edison on a bailout for the utility. Late last week, at the bottom of a press release, Davis announced that Fabiani was no longer a communications consultant because his work had been ""successfully implemented."" Lehane, on the other hand, has dropped his contract with Edison and signed a new agreement with Davis. Lehane's new contract includes reimbursement for travel and meal expenses, which he didn't have before, and requires him to work a maximum of 66 hours a month at $150 an hour. His total payments are capped at $76,000 for work from June 26 to Nov. 20, 2001. In his release, Davis said Lehane would be paid the same amount as former communications director Phil Trounstine, about $9,900 a month. But Connell, like Davis a Democrat, said Trounstine undoubtedly worked more than 66 hours in a month for his $9,990. ""We don't intend to be paying it,"" Connell said of the contract for both men. ""They represented Southern California Edison. You have to have a singular relationship with the state of California and not show a conflict."" Previously, the Davis administration said there was no conflict because Edison and Davis wanted the same things out of their negotiations. Earlier this week, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said attorneys had different opinions over whether the two consultants had violated ethics rules. Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said the governor had signed an executive order allowing him to enter into consulting contracts with anyone he believed could help him solve the state's energy crisis. She said Lehane had been working full-time on public policy, even though his contract caps his salary. The National Tax-Limitation Committee, a Sacramento group that mostly monitors legislation, sued last month alleging that Fabiani and Lehane were violating the state Political Reform Act because of the Edison contract. In a recently filed disclosure statement, Fabiani also listed more than $10, 000 worth of consulting work for Cisco Systems, another company that frequently brings issues before state authorities, including Davis. The state Fair Political Practices Commission also is looking into a complaint filed by GOP Secretary of State Bill Jones that Fabiani and Lehane violated state ethics rules.

Page?A - 3 Ex-staff speaks out against Duke Two more charge prices manipulated Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Friday, July 6, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/07/06/M N122949.DTL Sacramento -- Two more former employees at Duke Energy's Chula Vista power plant came forward yesterday with allegations that the company manipulated the energy market to drive up prices, although they offered no hard proof and little new information. Their accusations bring to five the number of Duke plant workers who say they observed suspicious behavior, including the disappearance of parts needed for repairs, the idling of generators for no apparent reason, and continual stopping and starting that critics of Duke suspect was designed to withhold power and artificially increase prices. E. Robert Edwards, a 50-year-old electrician, related one conversation with a Duke foreman sometime in January that prompted suspicion. ""I asked the foreman why Unit 4 wasn't running,"" Edwards said yesterday at a press conference. ""We had a 225-megawatt generator sitting there, and he just shrugged his shoulders and said, 'I really can't tell you. I'm not privy to that information.' "" State lawmakers have been focusing on whether Duke manipulated prices during three days in January, when the company at one point offered a single megawatt of power for a record-shattering $3,880. Duke says it was following orders from the Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power grid, when it repeatedly turned its generators on and off during those three days. An ISO memo recently released by Duke confirms the company's contention it was under orders. But January logs from the ISO and the generators don't offer an explanation for every allegation of price manipulation, since Duke has refused to release a detailed list of the prices it offered and paid during that period. The two workers who came forward yesterday, Edwards and 46-year-old Richard J. Connors, both worked more than 20 years in the business. They left the South Bay Plant in Chula Vista in April, two years after Duke purchased it from San Diego Gas & Electric as part of deregulation. SOME SHIFTS UNPOPULAR ""It is true units were taken offline, mostly on the weekends for whatever reason,"" said Connors, a former auxiliary operator. ""It got to the point as an operator that you were dreading working swing shifts on Sunday or graveyard Monday morning because you knew you were going to be running around putting units back online."" Edwards said he had seen a company warehouse eventually emptied of parts that are used to repair broken generators, although he didn't know where the parts went. Forcing a longer wait for repair parts was designed to dry up the power supply and push prices higher, lawmakers and other investigators suspect. Edwards, however, admitted the warehouse was being cleaned out even when SDG&E ran the plant. Duke contends the workers weren't familiar with Duke's inventory system and couldn't possibly know why parts were being moved. Duke and other energy companies are facing scrutiny by two legislative committees, a 19-member Sacramento County grand jury, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer, the California Public Utilities Commission and federal regulators. BUSTAMANTE ALSO SUING Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, who introduced Edwards and Connors yesterday, also is suing a variety of generators in state court for alleged price manipulation and bad business practices. He said Edwards and Connors ""reiterated what we've know all along -- Duke has been gouging California consumers through its use and abuse of the South Bay Plant."" Duke offers a variety of defenses for its actions during the three days in January and throughout the energy crisis. Tom Williams, a spokesman for Duke, said Edwards and Connors had offered nothing new yesterday. Beyond the ISO's 37 separate orders to stop and start generators during the three days in January, Williams said state air regulations required the company to shut the plant at certain times because it was running out of emissions credits that limit the amount of air pollution it can put out. Duke, which controls about 5 percent of the state energy market, also contends the state's power transmission lines can't always handle an increase in load. ""Yes, it's true there are times when that plant is not running at full capacity, and there is a Stage Three (alert), and there may be blackouts in San Francisco,"" Williams said. ""The reason why it's not running is the power cannot move up Path 15,"" the transmission line bottleneck near Los Banos.

Johnson, Chronicle Staff Writer Friday, July 6, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/07/06/M N138966.DTL Vallejo leaders, looking to escape mounting gas and electric bills, are planning to build enough new power generators that the city government will be self-sufficient when it comes to energy. City officials said they believe that Vallejo is the first city in the nation to take such an approach. ""This is going to be a showplace,"" said Scott Sossen, the chief executive officer of Edge Capital Group, a funding agency based in Orange County. Edge will be supervising the work along with O'Hara Energy Corp. of Nevada. The plan comes at a time when the city expects to see its energy costs double next year if it continues buying its power from PG&E. ""It couldn't be more timely,"" said Mayor Tony Intintoli. Vallejo leaders are in the process of contracting with private business to build new wind, solar and microturbine generators. Construction of a one- megawatt solar generator could start within 30 to 60 days. Conservation is also part of the plan, and energy-efficiency improvements are already under way at Vallejo City Hall and the fire and police stations. City officials hope to add enough sources of power generation to make all city offices -- which consume about 10 megawatts a year -- self-sufficient by the end of the year. The Vallejo City Council gave tentative approval to the project late last month and will continue its discussions on the plan next week. Vallejo taxpayers won't have to pay any money in advance, because Edge will finance the project's first $50 million in capital costs. In return, a portion of the city's projected financial savings will be shared with the Edge and O'Hara. ""This is a fairly sizable project,"" said Kevin Chambers, the chief executive officer at O'Hara. ""Energy-efficient capital is difficult to find because it is such a new field."" O'Hara is installing high-tech energy management systems at all city-owned property to reduce energy consumption. Final sites for the construction of new wind, solar and microturbine generators have not been chosen. In recent years, the energy bill for Vallejo city government has averaged between $2 million and $3 million per year. That includes the police and fire departments, City Hall and water-pumping stations. Vallejo is part of a group of 50 local governments in Northern California that pooled their resources to buy electricity and natural gas, keeping prices down. But the group's current contract expires Dec. 30. As a result, the city expects its energy bill to double next year, from 9.2 cents per kilowatt hour to 20 cents per kilowatt hour. ""It's been very positive what we've been doing, and it hasn't cost us anything,"" said City Manager David Martinez. ""We're going to be very optimistic that this is going to be a good thing for the city."" City officials hope to eventually extend the plan to Vallejo's 4,500 businesses and 37,000 households.

Page?A - 23 SEC asked to see if PG&E Corp. violated law with subsidiary Published Friday, July 6, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News BY JENNIFER BJORHUS Mercury News California Attorney General Bill Lockyer asked the federal Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday to step in to investigate whether PG&E Corp. violated federal law in taking billions of dollars from its bankrupt subsidiary. ``SEC scrutiny is essential to protect the public interest, ratepayers and the people of the state of California,'' Lockyer said in a statement. More than $4 billion flowed from the Pacific Gas & Electric utility to parent PG&E Corp. from 1997 to 1999, according to Lockyer's petition, representing nearly 70 percent of the cash that flowed to the parent company during that period. PG&E Corp. spent $2.7 billion to buy back its stock, $1.5 billion to pay dividends to shareholders and invested $800 million in its other subsidiaries, according to the petition filed Thursday in Washington. Those figures are similar to figures from a state-ordered independent audit of PG&E Corp.'s finances released in late January. By moving assets from the utility to other businesses, the company potentially harmed the utility and violated the federal Public Utility Holding Company Act in several ways, according to the petition. The SEC is the nation's top cop for publicly held companies. But the commission has not reviewed PG&E Corp.'s asset movements, saying the company is exempt from scrutiny under the Public Utility Holding Company Act because it's mainly a California operation and such intrastate operations are exempt. The attorney general's office argues that PG&E Corp., with more than $13 billion of its assets outside the state, can no longer claim it is primarily an intrastate company. The SEC should step in, it argues. The petition surprised PG&E Corp. officials, who said they had no idea the attorney general's office had an issue with the company's exemption from the federal law, said company spokesman Greg Pruett. Pruett said PG&E Corp.'s actions were appropriate because the federal utility law only applies if a company has one or more of the following activities in several states: electric transmission and distribution, gas distribution or utility-owned generation. ``We have none of those things except in California,'' Pruett said, adding that the National Energy Group, a PG&E Corp. affiliate, ``has natural gas transmission but no distribution.'' ``The power plants that NEG owns or operates are not part of a utility and thus aren't regulated by PUCHA, and it has an energy-trading arm that is also not regulated by PUCHA,'' he said. The petition further asks the SEC to order PG&E Corp. to cooperate fully with the California Public Utilities Commission. The state commission is investigating whether PG&E Corp.'s corporate structure and its relationship with its bankrupt utility violate state utility regulations.

Judge may speed up electricity refund talks Published Friday, July 6, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News BY RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR Los Angeles Times WASHINGTON -- A federal mediator seeking a settlement for billions of dollars in alleged electricity overcharges in California signaled Thursday that the talks are in trouble. Curtis L. Wagner Jr., chief judge of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said he may issue a report on the closed-door talks as early as today if progress is not made. ``The judge will perhaps issue a preliminary assessment of the talks,'' said Tamara Young-Allen, a FERC spokeswoman. ``He will do this only if he feels the talks aren't moving along as he sees fit.'' Wagner had previously said all sides would labor in private through the weekend to try to get a deal by the deadline of Monday at midnight. If that failed, the judge said, he would take seven days to craft a proposed settlement for FERC's governing board. California is demanding $9 billion in refunds. According to sources, the generators have offered less than $1 billion. Wagner is said to be probing for a compromise figure that could take the form of a mix of cash payments and discounts on long-term contracts for power. Davis keeps state addicted to fossil fuels Published Friday, July 6, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News BY JOE COSTELLO BEFORE this year's energy ``crisis,'' Gray Davis wanted to be known as the education governor. However, Davis and his advisers' energy teachings have revealed alarming failures, setting back state energy policy not one or two years, but one or two decades. While George W. Bush proposed an energy policy tied to fossil fuels, disproportionate building of centralized generation plants, too little energy efficiency, lowering environmental standards and increased global warming emissions, Davis enacted it. First, Davis has tied the state for the next decade or longer to contracts with facilities that are exclusively fossil fuel generation. Second, he has encouraged an unprecedented surge in the building of new centralized fossil fuel plants. Finally, he has pushed the lowering of environmental standards to increase production from the dirtiest fossil fuel facilities. The state's new energy purchasing department has spent zero on renewable generation. David Freeman, the governor's energy czar, giving lip service to alternatives, has negotiated close to $50 billion in long-term contracts with fossil fuel generators. By comparison, the governor has authorized investment of only $13 million in expanding solar generation. Photovoltaic cells produce electricity directly from the sun's energy, offering a clean, efficient solution to the state's future peak energy demand. While the governor talks a lot about energy efficiency, the state's funding of demand programs is about 1 percent of the funding for supply. Most egregious, the vast majority of state energy efficiency money is funneled back to the utilities. While environmentalists deride the Bush administration proposals, in California organizations such as the Natural Resources Defense Council actively support Davis' fossil fuel energy policy. The Davis energy policy has stuck California with the same old electric system for at least the next decade. Money has literally been burned instead of invested in innovation and creation of a cleaner and more efficient system. The best hedge against price spikes is a diversity of fuel sources, unfortunately California's electric system is now tied to an even greater degree to fossil fuels. After binding the state economy to the past, the Davis end game is logical. Davis and his energy advisers want to spend tens of billions of dollars for the utilities' restoration -- the very companies that for so long stifled industry innovation and remain most responsible for California's energy fiasco. There is still an opportunity to make the best out of a bad situation. Instead of bailing out the utilities, they should be dismantled and sold off. A combination of a dozen or so local government and publicly owned companies should be created with a goal of innovating the industry. An auction could be held that would sell customer blocks and with it the state's long-term contracts. Choice should be reinstated with the lifting of the suspension on direct access to alternative suppliers. Instead of moving the state to the next level of energy development, the education governor's remedial energy teachings will force California to repeat its energy lessons.

Business Economics fuels power solution in California Price relief gains political support Robert Gibbons, BridgeNews ? 07/06/2001 Chicago Tribune North Sports Final ; N Page 3 (Copyright 2001 by the Chicago Tribune) Political pressure coming from the U.S. Congress and politicians from Western states seems to have influenced the approach to the power crisis, despite opposition to price caps in the Bush administration. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in June expanded price mitigation measures on wholesale electricity sales in California during periods when blackouts are possible. The measures encourage generators to sell power into the state to prevent emergency alerts from being declared, which trigger price caps. The move came with support growing in Congress, especially among representatives of Western states on both sides of the aisle, for legislation that would have capped wholesale prices in the region. The macroeconomic force may have been the difference between the $7 billion cost of power for California in 1999 and its rise to approximately $27 billion in 2000. The cost is estimated to reach between $50 billion and $70 billion in 2001. With that kind of money at stake, suddenly the concern becomes less a question of who is responsible for the problem, but rather, how it can be solved quickly to prevent harsh political consequences. California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer has conducted an investigation into the actions of power generators and offered multimillion dollar rewards to whistleblowers to provide evidence of price manipulation by independent power generators. The state is seeking refunds of $8.9 billion, the amount it estimates independent power generators overcharged California 's troubled utilities. The U.S. General Accounting Office has released a report criticizing the FERC for not finding evidence of power generators using plant outages to drive up prices in California . ""FERC's [February] study was not thorough enough to support its overall conclusion that audited companies were not physically withholding electricity supply to influence prices,"" the GAO found. Of the major independent power generators and marketers, like Reliant Energy, Dynegy, Duke Energy and Enron, only Williams and its CEO Keith Bailey came out in April in favor of some sort of short- term price relief for California . ""The political dynamic out there is much more Draconian than what we're proposing,"" Bailey told analysts in April, defending Williams' position supporting some limited, short-term price mitigation. What he was worried about was California Gov. Gray Davis using eminent domain powers to take over power plants and the state setting up a public power authority to build state-owned plants. Financial California Changes Stance on Refunds; Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks Peter Behr ? 07/06/2001 The Washington Post FINAL Page E01 Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity , saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis. ""We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get us $8.9 billion,"" Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. ""You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion."" The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close to the negotiations. Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise. ""What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood,"" Wagner told reporters. ""In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment."" The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday. Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility, drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn, chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said. Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides, is closed to the public and media. Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a ""joke"" that the parties might as well wear ""clown suits,"" according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks. But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said. Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure, some energy analysts believe. Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals. California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile ""spot market"" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so did the state's electricity bills. In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy analysts say. A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a ""refund"" because the deals were reached ""under commercial duress,"" according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. ""There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be,"" said Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a ""just and reasonable"" standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. ""It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate,"" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid. Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room ""billions of dollars apart,"" as the talks approached their final weekend, sources said. http://www.washingtonpost.com Contact: http://www.washingtonpost.com Politics & Policy U.S. Hearing Officer May Impose Pact To End California Power-Overcharge Case By Richard B. Schmitt ? 07/06/2001 The Wall Street Journal Page A10 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) WASHINGTON -- With settlement talks apparently stalled, a federal hearing officer said he may propose his own solution to settle billions in alleged electricity overcharges tied to the California power crisis. Curtis L. Wagner Jr. said he was still ""optimistic"" California officials and several power companies could come to terms on $8.9 billion in disputed electricity charges the state has incurred over the past year. Absent more-meaningful progress, he said he would offer his own ""preliminary assessment"" and recommendation as soon as today. In that event, Mr. Wagner also said, he would convene a hearing Monday where the two sides would be given the chance to comment on his plans. Mr. Wagner has previously indicated he feels California is due some refunds, but far less than the total the state claims. California is also indebted to the power companies for billions in previous deliveries; those debts could at least partially offset any refunds. Mr. Wagner has also said long-term contracts that would insulate the state from the sort of price shocks it has experienced over the past year could be part of any resolution. An administrative-law judge with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Mr. Wagner was named by the panel two weeks ago to broker a peace of the overcharge dispute. Commission officials have given the parties until Monday to reach an agreement behind closed doors. After that, absent a settlement, the commission has ordered Mr. Wagner to report back with his findings and recommendations within a week. At that point, the commission has said it will impose a settlement of its own liking. The overcharge issue has been a flash point in the California debacle, with the state's governor, Gray Davis, calling the energy companies ""pirates"" and ""marauders."" The industry considers itself a scapegoat for a bungled state deregulation effort.",1,"Company Business, Strategy, etc."

To: Jan Smutny-Jones, Steven Kelly, Katie Kaplan
Cc: IEP Board of Directors
From: Julee Malinowski-Ball, Edson + Modisette
RE: Legislative Status Report Week Ending 4/20


RECENT EVENTS:

-- IEP with the help of Chris Ellison has been at the negotiating table mos=
t
of the week dealing with the most recent amendments to SB 28x.  SB 28x
(Sher/Battin) makes various changes to the siting process including many
IEP-sponsored proposals.  As you will recall, two new provisions were added
to the bill at the last minute before going to the Assembly Floor dealing
with both retrofit schedules and environmental dispatch of generating
facilities.  Per the direction from IEP member companies, IEP has decided
not to negotiate on the environmental dispatch issue. If the provision
remained in the bill, IEP would continue to push the Republicans to hold
their opposed position. We were, however, given the authority to negotiate
on the retrofit issue as long as we were only talking about facilities that
already have retrofit requirements.  I will be faxing out the agreed upon
language which in essence says the ARB shall set a schedule for the
completion of any mandated retrofits.  It does not expand the authority of
the air districts and ARB to mandate retrofits under existing law. The
schedule would require completion of the retrofits by July 1, 2004 or such
later date as the ISO determines is necessary to maintain reliability.

With these amendments, including some clean-up language, SB 28x will be
voted-on on the Assembly floor on Monday and go to the Senate for
concurrence on Tuesday.  The final version will include the following
IEP-sponsored proposals:

? Conforming the timing of offsets for power plants to Clean Air Act
requirements
? Substituting CEQA-style hearings for the trial-like proceedings of the CE=
C
? Streamlining the permit process for the modernization of existing power
plant sites
? Giving consideration to the positive environmental impacts of a proposed
project.
? Improving the timeliness and coordination of state and local agency
review.
? Extending the current deadlines for the expedited review process
established in AB 970.

Since SB 28x is only a first step in making changes to the siting process,
IEP member should now be thinking about what is next.  IEP proposals still
on the table include:

? Permitting local agencies to make zoning changes or other decisions for
power plants contingent upon CEC CEQA Compliance
? Giving deference to other state and regional agencies
? Easing the threshold for override of local land use requirements.
? Making the ISO responsible for determining interconnection requirements

-- Bad news on the =01&California First=018 issue quickly followed the good=
 news.
The CEC staff analysis which said the State can't require builders of new
power plants to sell electricity here, even as a trade-off for expedited
permitting, was countered by another staff analysis that says the state can=
.
Both documents cannot be obtained due to attorney-client privilege.  This
issue is coming to a head next week with a decision pending by the CEC to
include a California First clause on the approval of an expedited AES power
plant project.

AB 60x (Hertzberg), which ties to the siting process the requirement that a
developer enter into a contract to sell power to specified California
entities, is still poised to be heard in the Senate Energy committee.  IEP
members company lobbyist should continue to lobby against this measure
regardless of the CEC=01,s decision on AES, although our arguments are
definitely strengthened if the addition of the clause at the CEC is denied.

-- IEP has finalized negotiations with Senator Burton=01,s office on amendm=
ents
attempting to solve our problem with the eminent domain provision in SB 6x
(Burton), which is the State Power Authority measure.  Attached is a copy o=
f
the bill in PDF form.  The agreed upon language, which clarifies that the
Authority=01,s purpose is to supplement existing generation activities, can=
 be
found on pages 6-7 (Section 3310), 13 (Section 3341.1) and 16-17
(Section3352). Considering the inflammatory remarks made by Senator Burton
in the press lately regarding seizing generation assets, this was most
likely the best we could get.

-- The first of Senator Dunn=01,s hearings with the Senate Select Committee=
 to
Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Market occurred this week.
This week and next week=01,s topics will be to go over previous investigati=
ons
into market power. The committee heard or will be hearing testimony from:
Frank Wolak, Chairman Market Surveillance Committee, CAISO; Eric
Hildebrandt, Manager Market Monitoring, CAISO; and, Elaine Howle, State
Auditor.

--  The Assembly Electricity Oversight Subcommittee met this week and
focused on the issue of natural gas collusion. Testifying before the
committee were representatives from Dynegy and El Paso, commenting on the
rise of natural gas prices and whether illegal market manipulation and
collusion occurred.  The subcommittee plans on putting together a package o=
f
bills related to natural gas issues, which would be the culmination of the
committee=01,s hearings over the last two months.  This package will be up =
for
consideration first by the whole special Assembly Energy committee.

-- Governor Davis came out this week supporting the construction of the
Calpine Metcalf Energy Center, the 600-megawatt power plant proposed for th=
e
San Jose region.  The Governor urged the CEC to approve the plant siting so
that construction can begin.

-- Two long-term contracting bills are scheduled for hearings next week.
IEP counsel is currently reviewing AB 57 (Wright) and SB 997 (Morrow) and
will comment on their provisions as soon as possible.

--  Attached is the most recent legislative tracking reports, both the
special session and regular session.  Please let me know if you need copies
of any of these bills.

Dear all,

We have developed analytical soulutions for weather-triggered commodity options.
We have also programmed those formulas into user-friendly Excel functions.

The original request came from the weather derivatives structuring desk, but the
model can be used in other situations --- generically it is a double trigger option deal.

See the documentation for more details.

My message was sent before I finished it.
I think it would be interesting to focus your attention on this interplay  
--  what policy changes have meant to companies (ie the winners and losers) 
and how explicit companies are about how government policy drives their 
business strategy in these industries.  I also think it would be fascinating 
to compare regulators' visions for the industry they are restructuring with 
the reality after the fact.  I believe you would find some similarities but 
also some substantial and interesting differences.
Good luck with your studies.
My best regards to Mike; I learned a great deal working for him.

I think the issue is that if they only have one client then they could be considered employees from a 'discrim/coverage' standpoint.  The issue is probably not in the area of insured plans but the qualified plans.  The 410(b) is our adequate coverage test for the pension plan.

Michelle, I was presented with some interesting information yesterday
and I wanted to run it by you . . . I was not told this by an ERISA
attorney but it was a person who works with Benefits frequently.  The
person told me that, if a company only had one customer, the company's
employees had to be included in the control group of the customer for
discrimination testing purposes on the benefits plans.  It sounded a
little iffy to me . . . could you verify?  Thanks.

Power Hogs May Get Hit In Pocketbook 
Davis favors tiered rate increases 
David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer

N30195.DTL 
Gov. Gray Davis, faced with the near inevitability of raising consumers' 
electricity bills, is leaning toward a rate system whereby those who use more 
power pay more than those who conserve, The Chronicle has learned. 
Sources close to the governor said he is being lobbied by his own staff 
members to accept a so-called structured rate system. 
Top officials from his own administration told lawmakers Friday that the 
state may end up spending more than twice the $10 billion previously 
estimated to purchase power on behalf of California's near-bankrupt 
utilities. 
If so, the officials warned that consumers' electricity rates could double. 
In the case of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., this would mean customers' 
average monthly power bills would rise from $60 to $120. 
Consumers throughout the Bay Area believe that at least some increase is on 
the way. 
""We're going to have to bite the bullet and pay the money,"" said Larry 
Webster, a retired Caltrans worker in Redwood City. ""We might as well admit 
that electricity is no longer a nickel. It's a dime. If you're going to use 
it, 
let's pay for it."" 
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, distanced himself yesterday 
from estimates that rates would double. The figures reported in the press, he 
said, ""were wildly high."" 
""The governor still believes he can live within the existing rate structure, 
"" Maviglio said. ""Until we know the results of the negotiations with the 
utilities, you can't conclude anything."" 
The state is negotiating a multibillion-dollar bailout package with PG&E and 
Southern California Edison Co. to relieve the utilities of about $13 billion 
in debt. 
PG&E and Edison have been saying for months that there is no way California 
can overcome its current energy woes without higher rates. The irony of the 
Davis administration now saying the same thing was not lost on the two 
companies. 
""The state is in the exact same position the utilities were in last fall,"" 
said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman. ""Either wholesale prices need to come 
down or retail prices need to go up. The disparity is too large."" 
Statewide blackouts last week drove home the precariousness of California's 
energy situation to ratepayers -- and may have served as a blessing in 
disguise for the governor. 
COST VS. OUTAGES
If given a choice between further outages and paying higher rates, many 
consumers said they would accept increases in their power bills. 
""I don't like either choice,"" said Janet Leroux, facing the possibility of a 
gooey mess if the air conditioning goes out at her downtown San Francisco 
candy store. ""But I guess I'd go with higher rates. I sure didn't like the 
blackouts."" 
Publicly, the governor has been insisting for weeks that rates will stay 
within ""the existing rate structure"" -- a stealthy way of saying that 
January's 9 percent increase and an expected 10 percent increase next year 
will remain in place. 
But privately, he and his staff are discussing additional rate increases that 
could be spread over as long as 10 years, sources said. 
Utility executives and power generators told The Chronicle last week that a 
minimum 30 percent rate increase lasting up to a decade is in the cards. 
""For the good of California, it's inevitable,"" said Gary Ackerman, executive 
director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a Menlo Park energy industry 
association. 
Sacramento resident John Hax observed that when temperatures soar in the 
Central Valley this summer, he'd be more than willing to pay a higher price 
for power if this keeps the air conditioners on. 
""It's like gasoline,"" he said. ""I don't like paying higher prices for 
gasoline, but that's the price of doing business."" 
Ratepayers draw the line, though, at any increase topping 10 or 20 percent. 
""If it was 20 percent, I'd probably do it,"" said Tracy resident Mark 
Dougherty. ""But if it was more, like 50 percent, I'd rather go with rolling 
blackouts."" 
""I'd rather have blackouts,"" agreed Jenny Soghomonian, owner of a shoe- 
repair shop in San Francisco's Financial District. ""I don't want to pay rates 
that are so much higher."" 
NOT EVERY COST PALATABLE
This is the tightrope that state officials and industry players now find 
themselves walking: While consumers may be willing to pay more to avoid 
blackouts, they aren't willing to swallow virtually any cost thrown their 
way. 
Yet if rates are not high enough, they may not prevent daily blackout threats 
this summer and beyond. 
""Higher rates are the price signal that it takes for conservation,"" said Tom 
Higgins, senior vice president of Edison International, parent company of 
Southern California Edison. 
Simply put, he meant that most consumers will not aggressively conserve 
power, and thus alleviate shortages, unless there is a financial incentive to 
do so. 
Rebates proposed by the governor have met with only a lukewarm response, 
requiring, critics say, too much effort on the part of individual ratepayers. 
But a sudden spike in monthly power bills almost certainly would prompt 
widespread conservation measures. 
""It adjusts consumer behavior,"" Higgins said. ""People want to get their bills 
back down."" 
RATES' EFFECT ON USAGE
He and other industry sources said higher rates are perhaps the only way 
Californians will achieve the 10 percent conservation goal sought by the 
governor -- a move seen as vital if blackouts are to be avoided this summer. 
""It's intellectually dishonest to think there's any other way out of this,"" 
Higgins said. 
Consumer activists' initial reaction to any talk of a rate increase comes 
across loud and clear: No, no, no. 
""No bailout. No rate increases. No secret deals,"" said Harvey Rosenfield, 
head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. ""We 
need to get back to a regulated system."" 
Rosenfield is the biggest fly in the governor's ointment. He has threatened 
to push through a ballot initiative re-regulating California's power market 
if Davis cannot find a consumer-friendly way out of the current fix. 
Because of Rosenfield's past success in writing a ballot measure on insurance 
rebates, which delivered about $800 million to consumers, his threat is taken 
seriously in Sacramento. 
""We've paid too much already,"" Rosenfield said. ""A fair price is what we were 
promised by deregulation, which was a 20 percent rate decrease."" 
However, when he was asked whether there was any room to discuss a structured 
rate increase such as the idea being promoted by the governor's staff, 
Rosenfield toned down his characteristic rhetoric. 
""Big users should pay more,"" he said after a moment's reflection. ""I'm open 
to a tiered system but only if it's fair."" 
Rosenfield quickly added that he would have to see how other consumer 
advocates felt about the matter before agreeing to negotiate such things with 
Davis. 
MOVE TOWARD STRUCTURED RATES
Clearly, though, momentum is building toward a system of structured power 
rates, which probably would include increases of varying sizes for consumers. 
The California Public Utilities Commission is scheduled to address January's 
9 percent rate increase on Tuesday. That increase originally was given only a 
three-month duration, but most observers expect it to be renewed for at least 
another three months, if not longer. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch declined to comment on the likelihood of rates 
going up but added her voice to those backing a structured system. 
""I am a fan of restructuring rates to exempt conservation,"" she said. ""People 
who use a whole lot of power should pay more."" 
The biggest electricity customer in the state is the state itself, now that 
California is purchasing power on behalf of its cash-poor utilities. The 
state already has spent about $4 billion buying electricity and has yet to 
determine how the cash will be recouped from consumers. 
San Francisco resident Rosita Magee accepts that for California to find its 
energy footing once more, rates will probably be heading up. ""That way, you 
have more convenience and electricity, more stability,"" she said. 
But Magee has come up with another solution, one that doesn't involve rate 
increases and rolling blackouts. 
She's moving to Texas.

Sorry for the delay.

Here are the next four descriptions.



Only the three liquids one waiting now.

I have sent these to David Forster in our Project group to review first 
before I send them to yourself.  If I don't get them back today I will send 
them over the weekend so they are there for you on Monday.

Could you please send me comments back on all the other descriptions today.  
Is your fax machine at your end OK?  It's just that the other fax you sent 
came through a dark background making the comments a little hard to read.

My fax is 44 171 316 5420.

the descriptions.  I understand your deadline is the end of the week.

When can I expect the remaining descriptions?

Yesterday, the Federal Trade Commission issued a staff report on electricity restructuring issues.  It is an update of the July 2000 report done at the request of House Energy Chairman Tauzin and Subcommittee Chairman Barton.  They requested the report be updated.  A summary of the report and the full 80+ page text is on the FTC web site at www.ftc.gov on the upper left side of the home page.

I read the summary and will read the balance.  So far, so good.  It basically says that even states that have opened up to retail competition are in transition with a hybrid of regulation and competition, thus the expected benefits of competition have not yet emerged.  However, the report states that nothing to date indicates that competition, once the transition period is over, will not produce additional benefits for consumers.  The report's major conclusion is that competitive wholesale markets are important to achieving effective competition in retail markets.  

The summary includes something that sounds promising on RTO policy, saying ""And as wholesale and retail markets become regional, governing policies and jurisdictional approaches also must move in that direction for wholesale and retail competition to be successful.""","FTC Staff Report on Electricity Restructuring.

Joe,

As you are probably aware, Jim Hoecker is considering leaving FERC
relatively soon.  The President will then name a new Chairman.  Bill Massey
is quite interested in receiving the nomination.

Please call to discuss.

Attached is a memo comparing the CEC's forecasted supply and a more realistic 
look at what additional resources might be available this summer.

The bottom line is that:

1.  The CEC significantly underestimates the outages that may occur this 
summer.  They estimate in their 5,000 MW supply deficit for the summer that 
expected outages will be around 3,000MW.  However, November and December saw 
significantly higher outage levels.  (7,265 MWs) The FERC has investigated 
these outages and found no improprieties- just that the plants are overtaxed 
from running at higher than normal capacities.

2.  There are a lot of uncertainties surrounding the 1,244 MWs of projected 
supply from rerating/restarting existing thermal and renewable projects.  It 
is very unclear how much of this will be able to come on line by this summer, 
if at all.  As evidenced by the e-mail I sent out this morning, local 
communities may be very opposed to restarting shut down units.  In addition, 
these units are likely to be uneconomical.

3.  In the existing resource pool, there are roughly 1,430 MWs of peaking or 
other generation units that are running up against their operating hour 
limitations from air quality regulations.  The Governor has ordered the local 
air quality districts to address these restrictions,  We are beginning to 
seem some movement; however, the US EPA has yet to weigh in on these relaxed 
standards.

4.  The distributed generation/back-up generation capacity to make up some of 
the shortfall is still an unknown.  While there has been some relaxing of the 
limitations on run hours for back-up generation at ""essential public 
services"" the increase in DG is expected from ""clean"" sources, not diesel 
emergency generators.

5.  The CEC is doing everything it can to get 50+ MW peaking units on-line by 
this summer.  They are promising a 21-day permit application approval process 
and are offering to pay half of the cost of offsets, for ""clean"" sources of 
generation in critical areas.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.

Earlier today, the Senate Energy Committee held the first of two days of hearings on Chairman Bingaman's ""white paper"" on electricity and the electricity provisions of other pending bills.  The hearings will continue tomorrow with all of the five FERC commissioners as witnesses plus private sector witnesses.

Today's hearing went well from our perpective, with support for Super RTOs and general support for expanding the grid both physically and from an access view point voiced by Senators and witnesses.  Sen. Craig Thomas even said four RTOs were too many -- there should be one national RTO to run a national grid.  Today's witnesses represented the Dept. of Energy, EPSA, EEI, NRECA, APPA, IBEW union, Alliance to Save Energy, ELCON, NERC, NARUC, NASUCA and the State of New Mexico.  We will provide a more detailed analysis after completing a review of the lengthy written testimony, but a summary of the DOE testimony and the first panel of private sector witnesses follows.

1.	DOE said they are working on electricity legislative language.  Should be done soon.  Chairman Bingaman said they needed to get it done in time for the Committee to consider it when the Committee takes up electricity as early as the second week in September.  Deputy Sec. Blake implied that their proposal was or would soon be shared with other Administration agencies for review.

2.	In response to questions, Blake said that legislative action on jurisdiction questions (fed v. state) would be ""useful"" but he stressed that they view any new legislation as clarifying that FERC has authority they feel already exists.  He said that while states have an important role to play, Congress must recongize the interstate character of the market and the need for open access to the interstate grid.  (In response to a question, Blake later said that FERC had largely addressed the access issue or would do so.)

3.	On reliability, he was given a chance to say that DOE supports th NERC ""consensus"" language, but instead repeated that the Administration favors ""enforceable reliability standards"" but wants to work with the Committee on the exact language.  I took this as confirmation of what we have heard informally from DOE in terms of key players there not being enamored of the NERC ""consensus"" approach, at least as it exists in its old, long form.

4.	Sens. Craig and Cantwell pushed Blake on why the Administration has not fully supported BPA's request for a debt limit increase to finance expansion of the BPA grid.  Blake said they support the BPA expansion projects, but that OMB feels BPA has enough borrowing authority through 2003.  This did not sit well with Craig and Cantwell.  I spoke with Sen. Craig in the hall, following up on a conversation I had with him the other evening about BPA, and he stressed that he is committed to getting BPA the debt limit it needs.  As you know, commercial has asked us to help BPA given matters pending between Enron and BPA.

5.	On the first private sector panel, even John Rowe, the Co-CEO of Exelon and past EEI chairman (testifying for his company and EEI), said several times that there should be strong RTOs that each cover a wide idea.  He said his board voted yesterday to sell its transmission assets IF a strong, independent operator could be found.  Rowe also said that RTOs should be ""encouraged"" (implying not mandatory?).  The APPA witness was strong on RTOs, saying that all entities will be part of RTOs even without legislation.  NRECA said that co-ops would oppose federal jurisdiction over them and that they favor voluntary RTOs.  EPSA made the usual case for competition, open access, RTOs, etc.","Report on Senate Energy Hearing Today. Earlier today, the Senate Energy Committee held the first of two days of hearings on Chairman Bingaman's ""white paper"" on electricity and the electricity provisions of other pending bills. The hearings will continue tomorrow with all of the five FERC commissioners as witnesses plus private sector witnesses. Today's hearing went well from our perpective, with support for Super RTOs and general support for expanding the grid both physically and from an access view point voiced by Senators and witnesses. Sen. Craig Thomas even said four RTOs were too many -- there should be one national RTO to run a national grid. Today's witnesses represented the Dept. of Energy, EPSA, EEI, NRECA, APPA, IBEW union, Alliance to Save Energy, ELCON, NERC, NARUC, NASUCA and the State of New Mexico. We will provide a more detailed analysis after completing a review of the lengthy written testimony, but a summary of the DOE testimony and the first panel of private sector witnesses follows. 1. DOE said they are working on electricity legislative language. Should be done soon. Chairman Bingaman said they needed to get it done in time for the Committee to consider it when the Committee takes up electricity as early as the second week in September. Deputy Sec. Blake implied that their proposal was or would soon be shared with other Administration agencies for review. 2. In response to questions, Blake said that legislative action on jurisdiction questions (fed v. state) would be ""useful"" but he stressed that they view any new legislation as clarifying that FERC has authority they feel already exists. He said that while states have an important role to play, Congress must recongize the interstate character of the market and the need for open access to the interstate grid. (In response to a question, Blake later said that FERC had largely addressed the access issue or would do so.) 3. On reliability, he was given a chance to say that DOE supports th NERC ""consensus"" language, but instead repeated that the Administration favors ""enforceable reliability standards"" but wants to work with the Committee on the exact language. I took this as confirmation of what we have heard informally from DOE in terms of key players there not being enamored of the NERC ""consensus"" approach, at least as it exists in its old, long form. 4. Sens. Craig and Cantwell pushed Blake on why the Administration has not fully supported BPA's request for a debt limit increase to finance expansion of the BPA grid. Blake said they support the BPA expansion projects, but that OMB feels BPA has enough borrowing authority through 2003. This did not sit well with Craig and Cantwell. I spoke with Sen. Craig in the hall, following up on a conversation I had with him the other evening about BPA, and he stressed that he is committed to getting BPA the debt limit it needs.

As I had mentioned this morning, Joao Neves is quite interested in joining

Please advise.

The letter looks good.  A couple of comments for your consideration:

On page three we describe the change to the definition of Public Utility and 
then argue that we don't fit into it.  Would it be worth explaining why that 
makes sense?  Specifically, the New Jersey restructuring law, like most 
efforts of its kind in other markets, is designed to separate the competitive 
from monopoly elements of the power (and gas) businesses.  Economic 
regulation would then be restricted to the remaining monopoly elements of the 
business (eg distribution).  The competitive market can not be solely relied 
upon to ""regulate"" the behavior of monopoly asset owners, such as 
distribution utilities.  Therefore, regulators continue to be called upon to 
set pricing and other terms of service.  What those regulators decide matters 
a great deal to those monopoly utilities and it consequently makes sense for 
lawmakers to be concerned about attempts by such entities to use campaign 
contributions to tacitly influence decision makers.  The same public policies 
simply do not apply to that portion of the market which is competitive.  The 
generation and sales business has a competitive structure (i.e. relatively 
low barriers to entry, multiple competitors etc.).  These components of the 
power and gas business can be ""regulated"" by the market with respect to rates 
and terms of service.  They do not require economic regulation any more than 
grocery stores, department stores, appliance sellers or other ""retailers"" 
(who presumably are not prohibited from making contributions.  Competition 
and markets discipline behavior and establish competitive prices and terms of 
service.  Because regulators don't set the prices and terms of service for 
such sellers, there is no reason to be concerned about campaign 
contribuitions from such organizations.  Indeed, the legislation, and the 
legislative history, clearly conform to this underlying policy rationale.
As a former practicing lawyer, I certainly understand the value of pleading 
in the alternative.  But, I question how certain of our arguments woud be 
perceived by the public if they ever came to light (which these documents 
have a habit of doing).. .  I can just see the press seizing on Enron's claim 
of ""ignorance or mistake"" or the fact that we pled for the favorable exercise 
of ""prosecutorial discretion"".  I suggest that we add whatever we feel is 
necessary to the very solid looking intent argument, not make specific 
reference to ""ignorance or mistake"", and not plead for the favorable 
esxercise of PD.  If we feel we need to write about this last item, perhaps 
we could suggest that it would be a waste of the public's resources to pursue 
a claim under such circumstances.","AG letter - privileged and confidential: request for legal advice.. The letter looks good.

I can just see the press seizing on Enron's claim of ""ignorance or mistake"" or the fact that we pled for the favorable exercise of ""prosecutorial discretion"". I suggest that we add whatever we feel is necessary to the very solid looking intent argument, not make specific reference to ""ignorance or mistake"", and not plead for the favorable esxercise of PD. If we feel we need to write about this last item, perhaps we could suggest that it would be a waste of the public's resources to pursue a claim under such circumstances.",1,"Company Business, Strategy, etc."

Office of the Chairman:

While traveling within Germany recently, I noticed that electric powered 
trains are popular and also provide a safe, reliable, affordable and 
comfortable means of transportation to the public.

This brought to mind a question to ask you:

Is Enron taking any action to promote development and implementation of 
electric trains or light rail in the USA and/or abroad, either through the 
Political Action Committee, Lobbying or through the efforts of the Business 
Development Offices?

I do believe that the commuters would benefit from having access to electric 
trains that provide safe, clean and comfortable transport. Enron could 
potentially benefit by supplying the power for these trains within the USA 
(and abroad as well). 

Just think if the city of Houston offered light rail as an option for 
commuting to and from work, as well as commuting to other locations - both 
interstate and intrastate. A person could take a train to Galveston, Austin, 
or elsewhere and arrive in short time with the high speed rail available. 
With the new Ballpark downtown and the revitalization of the downtown area, 
it would seem that a legitimate method of public transportation is the 
element that is missing from the Houston city model. Buses that run on diesel 
are clearly not the solution for mass transit.

Subject: EGEP Sale Announcement

On Friday (last night Houston time) we announced Enron's decision to sell 
Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd. (EOGIL), our subsidary that owns a 30% interest in 
the Panna, Mukta and Tapti concession areas.    We now have bankers involved 
and a data room is being prepared in Houston which  made it extremely 
difficult to keep the deal quiet any longer.  There were a rumors circulating 
through the office, but the reality of the announcement was still a shock to 
most of the employees in India and Houston.  Attached is a memo we handed out 
to employees, but basically we said the following:
 1) Selling assets or companies is a routine part of Enron's strategy to 
redeploy capital in the higher return opportunities.  The company has 
exposure to a number of tremendous opportunities today that were not 
envisioned even twelve months ago.  In line with this strategy, we are 
placing EOGIL in the market.
 2) Depending on the success of finding an acceptable buyer for EOGIL,  we 
will be reviewing the balance of our portfolio for transfer to other Enron 
entities or for sale as separate packages.  We anticipate closing the EOGIL 
transaction and rationalizing the remaining portfolio by March 31, 2001.  
 3) Pending the success outlined in item #2, we will eliminate Enron Global 
E&P as an Enron business unit on March 31, 2001.
 4) We announced some interim staff changes to facilitate the process. 
  a) Jeff Sherrick would re-focus his time largely on the sale process
  b) Mike Stewart will be responsible for all India activity except the sale 
process
  c) Steve Harper will be responsible for EGEP's sale activity and 
coordination with our bankers and Corporate Development
 5) Commented on the potential impact to employees in general terms.  We told 
them it was pre-mature to outline all of the possibilities until we signed a 
PSA with a buyer.  However, in general, there is a good likelihood that many 
people will either have opportunities for future employment with the buyers 
or through redeployment within Enron.  Those people that do not remain with 
the assets or are not redeployed in Enron will be involuntarily terminated 
March 31, 2001 unless they are needed to close a transaction or to provide 
transition services to a buyer.
 
I would like to keep this as low-keyed as possible.  Last year when we were 
for sale there were not a lot of comments, but you never know.  If anyone in 
the media picks up on this I would expect it to happen early next week.  Mike 
Stewart is currently in India in the Mumbai office (01191228395841) and can 
be reached at the Mariott after-hours(01191228577878).  He is fully briefed 
on our position regarding the activities within EGEP and EOGIL.  Mike will be 
traveling offshore and to Baroda over the weekend and on Monday.  I will be 
available all weekend and next week at the following numbers; (work) 
713-853-5934, (home) 281-320-2198, (cell) 713-569-4713.  I would suggest 
talking with Mike or I before making any comments to the media if possible.

This afternoon I notified our partners and thr Gov't of India of our 
intention to market our assets.  I will be making a trip to India soon to 
visit with the appropriate people in these organizations within the next two 
weeks.  While I wouldn't expect this to happen, please refer any inquiries 
from our partners (ONGC and Reliance) or the GOI to Mike or me.  As you might 
expect, we want to be careful and consistent in our message to these 
groups.   

I will keep you informed regarding any changes to the above.  If you have any 
questions, contact me at the above numbers.

here is our analysis of load growth.  i have no idea where cera came up with 
there's.  in short, it looks like load grew somewhere between 5% and 6% per 
year between april 1998 and june of 2000.  since then, load growth has been 
flat to negative.  from april 1998 to february 2001 it looks like typical 
load growth was around 3.7% on an annualized basis.

California Changes Stance on Refunds; Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks
Peter Behr

07/06/2001
The Washington Post
FINAL
Page E01
Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved


California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to
recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity , saying
they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate
$43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this
year.


Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is
seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term
contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for
Davis.


""We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could
get us $8.9 billion,"" Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report
yesterday. ""You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money.
However you want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion.""


The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a
California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources
close to the negotiations.


Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on
the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot
reach a compromise.


""What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood,"" Wagner told
reporters. ""In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I
may offer a preliminary assessment."" The settlement conference is set to
conclude on Monday.


Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both
sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing
controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's
largest utility, drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and
put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's
lights on.


Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn,
chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid
manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in
refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said.


Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers
for all sides, is closed to the public and media.


Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda,
and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a ""joke"" that the
parties might as well wear ""clown suits,"" according to a Dow Jones report
confirmed by sources close to the talks.


But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by
Reliant Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern
Co., for failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The
suppliers have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able
to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds,
sources said.


Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's
commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but
now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's
electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher
refund figure, some energy analysts believe.


Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of
an overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will
have to pay for energy under those deals.


California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed
deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at
volatile ""spot market"" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer,
so did the state's electricity bills.


In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began
negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in
deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a
megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the
next 10 years.


That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was
paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and
considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade,
energy analysts say.


A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political
pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's
controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that
reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should
count as a ""refund"" because the deals were reached ""under commercial
duress,"" according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations.


Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify.
""There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be,"" said
Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research
Associates.


The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a ""just and reasonable""
standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit,
the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure.


""It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate,""
said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight
committee for the California grid.


Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room
""billions of dollars apart,"" as the talks approached their final weekend,
sources said.

FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure, some energy analysts believe. Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals. California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile ""spot market"" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so did the state's electricity bills. In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy analysts say. A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a ""refund"" because the deals were reached ""under commercial duress,"" according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. ""There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be,"" said Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a ""just and reasonable"" standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. ""It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate,"" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid. Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room ""billions of dollars apart,"" as the talks approached their final weekend, sources said.",1,"Company Business, Strategy, etc."

Calling All Investors: The New Power Company's IPO Priced at $21 Per Share

TNPC, Inc., parent of The New Power Company, announced yesterday that its
initial public offering (IPO) of 24 million common shares was priced at
$21 per share. The stock closed yesterday at $27 per share. The Company
expects to receive net proceeds from the offering of its shares at=20
approximately
$473 million, exclusive of the underwriters' option to purchase an addition=
al
3,600,000 common shares to cover over allotments. TNPC, Inc.=01*a partnersh=
ip
between Enron, America Online (AOL) and IBM=01*was formed in late 1999 to
provide electricity and natural gas directly to households and small=20
businesses
in the deregulated energy marketplace. TNPC's shares will be listed on
the NYSE under the symbol NPW. Closing of the offering is expected to occur
Oct. 11.

ANALYSIS: I am sure that many eyebrows were raised when TNPC issued the
IPO of its stock at $21, a figure that seemed surprisingly high for a start=
-up
company that has been in operation only since early summer. It is rather
mind-boggling that a company with no significant track record could open
its stock at such a price, but it is not unheard of. In fact, TNPC is=20
following
a trend of new Internet companies initiating IPOs that are supported by
grand concepts rather than tangible success. However, the TNPC ""dream team""
alliance between Enron, AOL and IBM has been met with great expectations
(and a lot of skepticism as well) throughout the industry.

I read through the S-1/A filing that TNPC submitted to the SEC, so hopefull=
y
I can cut through the hype regarding this deal to get to its nucleus. First=
,
TNPC acknowledges repeatedly throughout its filing that it is entering
into an extremely high-risk venture, and in fact will ""incur substantial
operating and net losses, and cannot assure that we will attain=20
profitability.""
Further, TNPC admits that it expects to incur these losses for a=20
""significant,""
but undetermined, period of time. Why, then, would Wall Street be greeting
this IPO with such a positive welcome? One could easily argue that the
sheer market presence of Enron, AOL and IBM has by association driven up
the value of TNPC, but I think a deeper answer lies within several factors.

First, TNPC has been bankrolled by some hefty investments. In two separate,
private placements, investors such as Enron, GE Capital Equity Investments
and DLJMB Partners (among others) put up about $214 million in start-up
capital in exchange for shares in the company. Enron is the majority owner
of TNPC, with 57-percent control. This money has allowed TNPC to make=20
important
acquisitions. For instance, TNPC bought the residential and small commercia=
l
retail energy business of Columbia Energy Group, which includes approximate=
ly
285,000 natural-gas customers and 20,000 electricity customers in eight
states. This is a valuable card in TNPC's deck as it locks in customers
during this time when deregulation is developing slowly in retail markets.
I wouldn't be surprised if TNPC makes a similar acquisition of another
customer base in the near future, such as in Texas, where customers have
been spun off to energy service companies rather than being held by the
T&D operations of utilities. In other words, in Texas TNPC could easily
buy customers without having to buy wires or infrastructure, assuming there
is a willing seller.

Second, and perhaps more importantly, earlier this year Enron transferred
its residential and small commercial retail operations in California and
Ohio to TNPC. This deal included the operations of Enron Energy Services
but did not include PG&E Energy Services, which Enron acquired earlier
this year. Together with the Columbia Energy Group acquisition, TNPC has
come out of the gate running with a significant beginning customer base
of over 325,000 customers. Why would Enron have turned over its residential
customers to TNPC?  Don't forget that Enron struggled in and retreated
from the California residential market, stating that it couldn't make any
money in the retail market. TNPC's S1/A filing confirms rumors that Enron
Energy Services actually retreated from California due to a lawsuit claimin=
g
the company had violated laws relating to advertising directed to residenti=
al
consumers in 1997 and 1998. Enron was in fact banned from selling power
to the residential market in California. Under this customer transfer,
Enron is able to put its money into a completely separate business=01*essen=
tially
moving this high-risk business venture, and worst performing part of its
retail service, off its own books. Yet if TNPC succeeds, Enron still benefi=
ts
as it is the majority owner.

I think these two factors answer why Wall Street has looked so favorably
on a self-described ""new company with a limited operating history."" Looking
ahead, can TNPC maintain this comparatively high value of its stock?  Well,
there's both good news and bad news for TNPC. First, let's look on the
bright side. TNPC has put into place a great management team, starting
with H. Eugene Lockhart, formerly of AT&T, as president and CEO. Other
key players bring retail market expertise from work at MasterCard, Exxon
and PespiCo. In addition, within the energy industry, TNPC arguably could
not have a better backer than Enron. What other company's touch has been
golden in nearly every venture it has pursued? In addition to being the
majority owner, Enron probably is also providing TNPC access to commodities
at preferential prices, which will certainly enhance its sales approach
in the retail market. Plus, TNPC has access to the 24 million customers
that AOL represents, which I've always thought was the company's secret
weapon.

But then there are the risks, and they are substantial. First, competition
is not materializing rapidly on the retail side. In a state like Pennsylvan=
ia,
which perhaps represents the strongest deregulated market in the United
States, only about 16 percent of customers in PECO's territory have opted
to switch their provider. So, TNPC has an uphill climb, to say the least,
in making any inroads at capturing a lock=01*and making money=01*in the ret=
ail
market. Second, the only way that I can see TNPC making it at all is if
they continue to buy customers like they did from Columbia Energy Group.
There are big questions surrounding whether the company will be able to
do this or not, and much of its success hinges on this uncertainty.

Third, and perhaps most serious of all, is TNPC's vulnerability on the
technology side of its operation. TNPC has entered into a 10-year revenue
management and customer care agreement with IBM Global Services, under
which IBM will manage the company's online commerce and billing application=
s.
IBM's track record in developing customer care systems is less than stellar=
.
In fact, PG&E initiated a lawsuit against IBM a few years ago when the
utility had to pull the plug on a massive $100 million customer information
system (CIS), employed by IBM, which it claimed was ineffective. IBM has
partnered with SCT to provide the infrastructure to be used by TNPC. Under
an agreement between IBM Global Services and SCT, the SCT Banner CIS will
be integrated into a number of back-office IT solutions under development
by IBM for TNPC. Experts in the CIS industry have questioned whether SCT's
Banner CIS can handle over one million customers. If it cannot, this will
surely limit TNPC's growth potential.

Moreover, although TNPC's IPO signals a strong future, there are many=20
uncertainties
surrounding this nascent operation. As one of the few major players in
the energy retail market, TNPC has very few competitors, with the possible
exceptions of NewEnergy or GreenMountain. Another competitor is also emergi=
ng
in Britain's Centrica, which plans to expand in North America after its
recent acquisition of Canadian retail gas supplier Direct Energy.=20
Consequently,
the coming year could either make or break TNPC and the challenges that
the company faces in wanting to conquer the retail market are extremely
steep.

Bill, we hit a home run this morning with HCAD.  They have agreed to take my 
reduced valuation on the Enron fleet.  A reduction of  $16,079,000 in taxable 
value.  This results in savings of $482,375.  That's not all, our allocation 
based on records for operations outside of the state of Texas resulted in 
additional savings of $1,559,638. Total savings to our 2000 budget will be 
$2,042,013.

   NEW YORK (DOW JONES)--THE CALIFORNIA SENATE IN SACRAMENTO PASSED A           
WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX ON SALES OF ELECTRICITY INTO THE STATE'S WHOLESALE         
ELECTRICITY MARKET MONDAY AFTERNOON AT 4:50 P.M. PDT. AT ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME
TIME, CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR INITIATED ROLLING BLACKOUTS FOR THE
FIRST TIME SINCE MARCH.                                                         
   COINCIDENCE? PROBABLY, BUT THE CONNECTION SHOULDN'T BE IGNORED.              
   ""THE POLICY DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED IN CALIFORNIA TO DATE HAVE      
ACCELERATED AN ALREADY SERIOUS MARKET COLLAPSE,"" SAID A HARVARD UNIVERSITY STUDY
OF CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY CRISIS LATE LAST MONTH.                                  
   THIS WEEK'S WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX BILL IS THE LATEST BLUNT INSTRUMENT WIELDED 
WITH POTENTIALLY DISASTROUS RESULTS. GOV. GRAY DAVIS WANTED IT AS A STICK WHEN  
                                                                          (CONT)
MEETING WITH EXECUTIVES FROM THE STATE'S MERCHANT POWER COMPANIES WEDNESDAY. THE
MANEUVER WAS LESS THAN ADROIT, AND THE GENERATORS WEREN'T IMPRESSED.            
   AFTER THE MEETING WITH DAVIS, RELIANT ENERGY'S (REI) JOHN STOUT SAID THAT IF 
THE TAX WERE IMPLEMENTED IN CALIFORNIA, IT WOULD ""INSTANTLY BLACK OUT ALL THE   
GENERATION IN THE STATE.""                                                       
   THE STATE'S LEADERS MIGHT KEEP IN MIND WHO WIELDS THE BIGGER STICK AT THIS   
POINT. CALIFORNIA SET UP A MARKET IN WHICH SELLERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CHARGE VERY
HIGH PRICES FOR ELECTRICITY SINCE SUPPLIES STARTED GETTING TIGHT A YEAR AGO.    
SELLERS SAY THEY HAVE PLAYED BY THE RULES THEY WERE GIVEN, AND NOBODY HAS PROVED
OTHERWISE WITH THE ONE EXCEPTION OF A FINE PAID BY WILLIAMS COMPANIES (WMB) FOR 
ONE PARTICULAR INSTANCE OF VIOLATING A CONTRACT.                                
   ""IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY INVENTED A NEW GAME, INVITED YOU OVER TO PLAY AND THEN   
CHANGED THE RULES A COUPLE OF TIMES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME. THEN, AFTER YOU  
BEAT THEM, THEY INSIST YOU CHEATED,"" SAID ONE WESTERN ENERGY TRADER.            
   ALMOST EVERY ATTEMPT BY THE BUY SIDE - THE UTILITIES, THE ISO AND NOW THE    
                                                                          (CONT)
STATE TREASURY - TO LOWER PRICES HAS RESULTED IN HIGHER PRICES OR BLACKOUTS OR  
BOTH. THE WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX IDEA IS THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE, BUT THOSE WHO   
INSIST ON PRICE CAPS SHOULD KEEP THIS IN MIND: THE ISO HAS HAD PRICE CAPS SINCE 
IT BEGAN OPERATION MORE THAN THREE YEARS AGO. OBVIOUSLY, PRICE CAPS HAVEN'T     
WORKED, JUST AS THEY HAVE NEVER WORKED EXCEPT DURING WARTIME.                   
   IN FACT, PRICE CAPS HAVE BEEN A QUESTIONABLE MEDICINE PRESCRIBED FOR THE     
WRONG DISEASE. AT BEST, PRICE CAPS MIGHT RESTRICT PRICE SPIKES. CALIFORNIA'S    
PROBLEM IS PERPETUAL HIGH PRICES. IT CAN'T AFFORD THE GOING RATE AT NIGHTTIME,  
LET ALONE THE HIGHER MARKET PRICES DURING THE AFTERNOONS IN A HEATWAVE.         
   CALIFORNIA MUST FIGURE OUT HOW TO PLAY BETTER THE GAME IT INVENTED. THE      
INSANELY COMPLICATED COMPUTER-BASED PURCHASING OF POWER ENDED A FEW MONTHS AGO, 
AFTER THE CALIFORNIA POWER EXCHANGE WAS CLOSED DOWN BY FEDERAL REGULATORS AND   
THE ISO LOST ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO BUY POWER. THE MATCH BETWEEN THE PROGRAMS 
AND THE ENERGY TRADERS WASN'T EXACTLY IBM'S ""BIG BLUE"" VERSUS GARRY KASPAROV.   
   ALMOST EVERYONE IN THE MARKET AGREES THAT THE UTILITIES' HUMAN TRADERS COULD 
                                                                          (CONT)
HAVE BOUGHT NEEDED POWER FOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS LESS THAN THE PROGRAMS THAT THE
UTILITIES WERE REQUIRED TO USE BY STATE LAW.                                    
   SINCE THE DEMISE OF PROGRAMMED PURCHASING, THE COMPUTERS HAVE BEEN REPLACED  
BY HUMANS, BUT WITHOUT MUCH BETTER RESULTS. THE TEAM ASSEMBLED TO BUY TENS OF   
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF SPOT POWER EVERY DAY CONSISTS MOSTLY OF FORMER     
EMPLOYEES OF THE POWER EXCHANGE AND ISO, AS WELL AS EXPENSIVE CONSULTANTS WITH  
NO ENERGY TRADING EXPERIENCE. ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE TRADING TEAM, FOR       
EXAMPLE, IS A FORMER PUBLIC RELATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE POWER EXCHANGE WITH NO

PDT. AT ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME TIME, CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR INITIATED ROLLING BLACKOUTS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE MARCH. COINCIDENCE? PROBABLY, BUT THE CONNECTION SHOULDN'T BE IGNORED. ""THE POLICY DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED IN CALIFORNIA TO DATE HAVE ACCELERATED AN ALREADY SERIOUS MARKET COLLAPSE,"" SAID A HARVARD UNIVERSITY STUDY OF CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY CRISIS LATE LAST MONTH. THIS WEEK'S WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX BILL IS THE LATEST BLUNT INSTRUMENT WIELDED WITH POTENTIALLY DISASTROUS RESULTS. GOV. GRAY DAVIS WANTED IT AS A STICK WHEN (CONT) MEETING WITH EXECUTIVES FROM THE STATE'S MERCHANT POWER COMPANIES WEDNESDAY. THE MANEUVER WAS LESS THAN ADROIT, AND THE GENERATORS WEREN'T IMPRESSED. AFTER THE MEETING WITH DAVIS, RELIANT ENERGY'S (REI) JOHN STOUT SAID THAT IF THE TAX WERE IMPLEMENTED IN CALIFORNIA, IT WOULD ""INSTANTLY BLACK OUT ALL THE GENERATION IN THE STATE."" THE STATE'S LEADERS MIGHT KEEP IN MIND WHO WIELDS THE BIGGER STICK AT THIS POINT. CALIFORNIA SET UP A MARKET IN WHICH SELLERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CHARGE VERY HIGH PRICES FOR ELECTRICITY SINCE SUPPLIES STARTED GETTING TIGHT A YEAR AGO. SELLERS SAY THEY HAVE PLAYED BY THE RULES THEY WERE GIVEN, AND NOBODY HAS PROVED OTHERWISE WITH THE ONE EXCEPTION OF A FINE PAID BY WILLIAMS COMPANIES (WMB) FOR ONE PARTICULAR INSTANCE OF VIOLATING A CONTRACT. ""IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY INVENTED A NEW GAME, INVITED YOU OVER TO PLAY AND THEN CHANGED THE RULES A COUPLE OF TIMES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME. THEN, AFTER YOU BEAT THEM, THEY INSIST YOU CHEATED,"" SAID ONE WESTERN ENERGY TRADER. ALMOST EVERY ATTEMPT BY THE BUY SIDE - THE UTILITIES, THE ISO AND NOW THE (CONT) STATE TREASURY - TO LOWER PRICES HAS RESULTED IN HIGHER PRICES OR BLACKOUTS OR BOTH. THE WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX IDEA IS THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE, BUT THOSE WHO INSIST ON PRICE CAPS SHOULD KEEP THIS IN MIND: THE ISO HAS HAD PRICE CAPS SINCE IT BEGAN OPERATION MORE THAN THREE YEARS AGO. OBVIOUSLY, PRICE CAPS HAVEN'T WORKED, JUST AS THEY HAVE NEVER WORKED EXCEPT DURING WARTIME. IN FACT, PRICE CAPS HAVE BEEN A QUESTIONABLE MEDICINE PRESCRIBED FOR THE WRONG DISEASE. AT BEST, PRICE CAPS MIGHT RESTRICT PRICE SPIKES. CALIFORNIA'S PROBLEM IS PERPETUAL HIGH PRICES. IT CAN'T AFFORD THE GOING RATE AT NIGHTTIME, LET ALONE THE HIGHER MARKET PRICES DURING THE AFTERNOONS IN A HEATWAVE. CALIFORNIA MUST FIGURE OUT HOW TO PLAY BETTER THE GAME IT INVENTED. THE INSANELY COMPLICATED COMPUTER-BASED PURCHASING OF POWER ENDED A FEW MONTHS AGO, AFTER THE CALIFORNIA POWER EXCHANGE WAS CLOSED DOWN BY FEDERAL REGULATORS AND THE ISO LOST ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO BUY POWER. THE MATCH BETWEEN THE PROGRAMS AND THE ENERGY TRADERS WASN'T EXACTLY IBM'S ""BIG BLUE"" VERSUS GARRY KASPAROV. ALMOST EVERYONE IN THE MARKET AGREES THAT THE UTILITIES' HUMAN TRADERS COULD (CONT) HAVE BOUGHT NEEDED POWER FOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS LESS THAN THE PROGRAMS THAT THE UTILITIES WERE REQUIRED TO USE BY STATE LAW. SINCE THE DEMISE OF PROGRAMMED PURCHASING, THE COMPUTERS HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY HUMANS, BUT WITHOUT MUCH BETTER RESULTS. THE TEAM ASSEMBLED TO BUY TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF SPOT POWER EVERY DAY CONSISTS MOSTLY OF FORMER EMPLOYEES OF THE POWER EXCHANGE AND ISO, AS WELL AS EXPENSIVE CONSULTANTS WITH NO ENERGY TRADING EXPERIENCE. ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE TRADING TEAM, FOR EXAMPLE, IS A FORMER PUBLIC RELATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE POWER EXCHANGE WITH NO TRADING EXPERIENCE PRIOR TO THE CURRENT JOB.

I understood the ""validation"" process to be a fairly flexible name applied to 
a wide variety of approaches.  What we specifically discussed, and what scott

the assumptions underlying them and some process (yet to be specifically 
determined) for addressing updates.  We agreed to start with the top 20 
curves and especially those which are involved in the upcoming deals.

I think the confusion is in what the term validation means.  In the ENA

was in Jim's memo and, as you'll recall, we went through point-by-point).  
Let's just get this done.

Scott --

We should talk about what was agreed to at the meeting.  

My discussions with others indicated that both (a) a curve validation process 
and (b) a deal-by-deal review would be undertaken.  The deal-by-deal review 
is especially critical during the implementation of a structured curve 
validation process.  In addition, even when the curve validation process is 
fully up and running, we should continue looking at major position impacts in 
new transactions.  There are many curves to review.  It seems reasonable to 
look at the critical rate curves as appropriate.

Let me know.

In the interest of clarity:  It was agreed that ongoing curve validation 
consistent with that followed on wholesale curves would be instituted.  It 
was further agreed that certain information would be provided by Scott 
Stoness to get this process going.  Such ongoing validation should make the 
impractical deal-by-deal review described below both redundant and 
unnecessary. 

I assume the list below did not contemplate the type of curve validation 
process we discussed and agreed to at the meeting.

Subject: EES - RAC Deal Approval Meeting

I received word late last week that Dave Gorte (works for Rick Buy) is 
setting up a meeting to discuss the process under which EES will have its 
deals considered by RAC.

I think that we should argue that the following package of information be 
pre-assembled and provided to Govt Affairs when EES brings a deal to RAC:

1. List of each position by utility and by rate class within the deal 

2. Regulated Rate forecasts by utility and by rate class for each position in 
the deal.  Not just the ""scalars"" but also the absolute $/Mwh.

3. For each impacted position, the key assumptions contained within the 
curves - 
 a. deregulation date (if any)
 b. stranded cost roll-off date (if any)
 c. standard offer end date (if any)
 d. other rate reduction dates and amounts (if any)

4. Revenue side or Cost side contract terms that impact the deal (for 
example, movement in pricing terms given some event)

I also think that we should have at least 3 working days to review this 
package.  

If anyone can think of anything else that would ease our analysis, I would be 
game.

Thanks.

JDS

I think I can recommend that the time be set aside, but it would be helpful 
if we pointed out to Emerson that it must be clear that there is a clear 
opportunity for Enron before we schedule the meeting.  Maybe you could use 
this to get some progress on a bundled outsource deal.

		 Subject: RE: Dates for Emerson Meeting

Gentlemen:

Situation:

Emerson is aggressively seeking at least a three hour time slot for a meeting 
with Jeff Skilling in April or May 2001.  Mr. Skilling's office is hesitant 
to allocate more than two hours without your recommendation.  Emerson is 
being persistent.

The key players from Emerson are David Farr, newly appointed CEO, and James 
Berges, President and effectively the leader of Emerson's strategic 
development effort.  It is anticipated that both would attend the meeting.

Emerson execs want to (i) get to know Mr. Skilling and other senior 
management, (ii) discuss mutual business opportunities, and (iii) hold a 
discussion about the transformation of Enron from a pipeline company to its 
current form.  The last point has to do with Emerson's continuing 
self-transformation effort and how Enron achieved its transformation.

I need your advice and recommendation.  Please respond by e-mail or telephone 
(x5-4040).


Background:

Emerson initiated this latest round of contact with Enron in November 2000, 
when Mike Train and Mark Proudfoot, both Emerson VPs of Corporate 
Development, visited the Enron building hosted by Steve Kean.  I met them at 
that time.

Since that initial meeting, Emerson has aggressively pursued a business joint 
venture as preferred supplier with Martin Wenzel and the distributed power 
business, I believe with promising results.  My sense is that Emerson is 
uniquely positioned as EES' partner in that business.  I am waiting to 
receive an update from Martin.

Emerson is also interested in becoming a preferred supplier for EES's DSM 
business.  While we generally support that idea, we are pressing Emerson to 
reciprocate by becoming a customer of our bundled outsource business.  
Emerson is highly decentralized, and our efforts to date have been 
unsuccessful.

I want to use the meeting as an opportunity to press Emerson to consider a 
proposal from EES's bundled outsource business.

Please let me know your recommendation on this matter.

Thanks,

Nate

Nate,

Thanks for the note - - I have dropped some ideas to Thad to follow up on
during my absence from the office.

I am a little nervous about having only two hours - - is it possible to get
a larger block of time to get to know each other better and talk through
some of the mutual business opportunities?

I talked with Scott Tholan and he immediately understood your concerns.  I 
don't think there is anything else you need to do right now.  Let me know, 
though, if there are requests for information you consider inappropriate.

Steve:  As discussed, I spoke with Clay and raised the points we discussed.  
Thus, I'm a bit surprised to receive this ""cover"" type memo.  To be clear 
with you, as I was with Clay (he repeated back my message verbatim so I feel 
he understood the issue), the issue is not maintaining excellent 
relationships, rather the issue is inappropriate requests for insider 
information.  By the way, the Administration meeting which set off the 
problem, Clay stated he doesn't remember where that information came from.  I 
have followed up with DOE and the Hill as discussed.  Please let me know if 
we need to do anything further.  thanks.

Dear Cynthia:

Just wanted to follow up with you from our conversation this morning.  Our 
office completely understands that maintaining excellent relations with your 
government contacts is the highest priority.  We therefore understand the 
need to cease inquiries on current issues.  We would never suggest taking any 
actions that could even be construed as improper, and we are continuously 
ensuring that our own work adheres to this principle.

We regret any difficulties that have arisen as a result of your making 
inquiries on our behalf.  We will ensure that similar problems do not arise 
in any future cooperative efforts between our offices.

Thanks again for your assistance.

Best regards,

Clay Seigle
Enron North America

I recommend reading CAISO's response.  This letter was reported in last week's trade press.

I am told that BPA does not consider this letter confidential even though it is labeled as such by CAISO.

Many of the  CAISO ""backpedal"" statements made re: claims of strategic bidding would apply equally to other importers.

Since Enron and EBS are trying to cut costs and be more cost effective, why 
would a vice president need an executive computer setup at home?  Especially 
if they already have a laptop (provided by Enron)  they take home every night 
and have taken advantage of the Click at Home program as well.  Since Enron 
has gone through the expense of giving each and every employee the 
opportunity of the Click at Home program, it seems to be a somewhat redundant 
expense of which I might add is unnecessary in my opinion.

I feel it would behoove ALL EMPLOYEES, including executives, to be more 
conscientious of costs and expenses to improve Enron's and EBS' bottom-line.  
How can we (""Enron"") be a world leading company if we don't have leading 
world leaders that spend Enron's money as if it were there own.

I think it would be in Enron's best interest to set some guidelines regarding 
expenses such as these.  Just because a person is an executive of the company 
why should be allowed to have anything they want just because they can?

Thank you for your time and the opportunity to express myself.  Especially 
since I am a shareholder also and care where the money goes.

Line Will Enhance Competition in Southeast Wisconsin and Use Existing=20

MILWAUKEE, July 13 /PRNewswire/ -- Wisconsin Gas, Northern Natural Gas and =
Guardian Pipeline announced today that Wisconsin Gas has signed an agreemen=
t with Northern Natural Gas (NNG) to purchase a nine mile, high pressure na=
tural gas pipeline in Walworth and Waukesha counties. The purchase price is=
 $5 million. The proposed transaction will require approval from federal an=
d state regulators. The pipe, known as the Eagle line, is located southeast=
 of the Kettle Moraine Forest near Eagle, Wis.
The existing line has been part of the NNG interstate transmission system. =
Under the new ownership, the line will become part of the Wisconsin Gas dis=
tribution system and will interconnect with Guardian Pipeline as well as th=
e NNG system.=20
""Northern Natural Gas is pleased to be a part of a creative, cost-effective=
 solution to provide additional gas service to southeastern Wisconsin,"" sai=
d Dave Neubauer, vice president of business development and marketing, Nort=
hern Natural Gas. ""This transaction enables Wisconsin Gas and its customers=
 to obtain natural gas supplies from Guardian or NNG. Providing reliable, e=
conomical choices for consumers will benefit all of the parties involved.""=
=20
""We saw this as an opportunity to minimize environmental impact and still r=
ealize the benefits of increased competition in the natural gas market,"" sa=
id James Schott, senior vice president, Wisconsin Gas. ""The purchase of the=
 Eagle line will enable Wisconsin Gas to further our goal of providing cost=
-efficient natural gas service to our customers.""=20
As a result of the purchase Guardian Pipeline, the 141-mile interstate pipe=
line from Joliet, Ill. to Ixonia, Wis., will no longer build an 8.5-mile la=
teral to Eagle. The lateral was part of the originally certified Guardian P=
ipeline. This portion of the line would have generally run parallel to the =
current Northern Natural pipeline.=20
""This sale is a win-win situation for Guardian and consumers,"" said George =
Hass, project manager of Guardian Pipeline. ""The Eagle line purchase by Wis=
consin Gas saves Guardian time and resources by taking away the need to bui=
ld the 8.5-mile lateral and allows all three companies to create a better e=
nvironment for competition in the natural gas marketplace.""=20
The existing gate stations at LaGrange and Eagle will remain in-service for=
 regulation purposes. Odorization and measurement will take place at a new =
gate station that will be constructed at the interconnect with Guardian. Th=
is new gate station will be called the Bluff Creek station and will be loca=
ted near Whitewater. The Bluff Creek gate station will be constructed durin=
g the construction of Guardian Pipeline.=20

ity of about 4.3 Bcf/d, provides natural gas transportation services to uti=
lity customers in the upper Midwestern United States through its approximat=

Commodities Review: LME Copper Hit By Another Stock Rise
By Mark Long and Steve McGrath
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

07/13/2001
Dow Jones Commodities Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Copper futures traded in London fell Friday, as a furt=
her influx of stocks into official warehouses put the copper market under p=
ressure and dragged down the rest of the base metal complex.=20
Three-month copper traded on the London Metal Exchange ended $6 down from T=
hursday's late kerb close at $1,554.50 a metric ton.
An increase of 7,475 tons of copper into LME warehouses Friday brought tota=
l stocks up to a 12-month high of 550,300 tons. This pressured prices in ea=
rly trade down to test $1,550/ton support, although prices recovered slight=
ly in later trade.=20
Unconfirmed market talk said Enron is behind much of the week's stock rise,=
 in an effort to ease nearby supply tightness and to alleviate the large sh=
ort positions it is thought to have built up on the July-for-a-week spread,=
 which is currently showing a $6-$8/ton backwardation. The July futures con=
tract will switch over to cash Monday.=20
Enron declined to comment on the market talk Friday.=20
A backwardation is a pricing structure in which deliveries to be made in th=
e near future are more expensive then those set for a more distant delivery=
. The opposite situation is called contango.=20
""The spreads are still tight. The major longs are still reluctant to lend, =
with no signs of that (tightness) dissipated,"" said Kevin Norrish, an analy=
st with Barclays Capital in London.=20
Dealers and analysts said they expect further stock increases next week.=20
The entire base metals complex ignored Thursday's 237-point rally in the Do=
w Jones Industrial Average, dealers said.=20
""Copper has been sensitive to moves in the stock market, but not this time,=
"" Norrish said. In fact, now it appears that base metals markets ignore equ=
ities markets when they rally, but follow stocks down when they slump, he a=
dded.=20
European Grain Futures See Profit-Taking, But More Gains Expected=20
European grain and oilseed futures were hit by a bout of profit-taking and =
pre-weekend position-squaring Friday, after rising to long-time highs, brok=
ers said.=20
However, world and domestic crop concerns, the strength of the dollar and g=
eneral bullish sentiment will carry the markets to fresh highs short term, =
they said.=20
On the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, the ben=
chmark November feed wheat contract ended just 25 pence up at GBP82/ton, af=
ter hitting a new two-year high of GBP83/ton in early trade.=20
Meanwhile, Matif November rapeseed futures fell EUR2.75 on the day to EUR26=
5/ton, after hitting a three-year high of EUR271/ton in early trade.=20
The U.K. wheat crop and the French rapeseed crop are forecast to be well do=
wn on last year, and wheat and canola crops in some other major producing c=
ountries are also expected to fall.=20
Meanwhile, the strength of the dollar is allowing European grain and oilsee=
d traders to up prices and still remain competitive against U.S. imports an=
d dollar-denominated grains on the world market.=20

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- London Metal Exchange three-month copper ended Friday'=
s late kerb lower compared with Thursday, pressured by another stock build,=
 dealers said.=20
(LME three-month metals prices in dollars a metric ton at 1600 GMT, with th=
e previous late kerb close in parentheses. Comex copper at 1641 GMT in cent=
s a pound, with the previous close in parentheses.) Copper 1,554.50 (1,560.=
50) Tin 4,452.50 (4,502.50)=20
Aluminum 1,452.25 (1,458.50) Zinc 871.50 (877.50)=20
Nickel 5,925.00 (6,012.50) Lead 462.50 (465.00)=20
Comex Sep Copper 70.75 (70.80)
An increase of 7,475 tons of copper Friday brought total stocks up to a 12-=
month high of 550,300 tons. This pressured prices in early trade down to te=
st $1,550/ton support before rising slightly to close at $1,554.50/ton, dow=
n from Thursday's close of $1,560.50/ton.=20
Unconfirmed market talk said Enron is behind much of the week's stock rise,=
 in an effort to ease nearby supply tightness and to alleviate the large sh=
ort positions it is thought to have built up on the July-for-a-week spread,=
 which is currently showing a $6-$8/ton backwardation. The July futures con=
tract will switch over to cash Monday.=20
Enron declined to comment on the market talk.=20
A backwardation is a pricing structure in which deliveries to be made in th=
e near future are more expensive then those set for a more distant delivery=
. The opposite situation is called contango.=20
""The spreads are still tight. The major longs are still reluctant to lend, =
with no signs of that (tightness) dissipated,"" said Kevin Norrish, an analy=
st with Barclays Capital in London.=20
Dealers and analysts said they expect further stock increases next week.=20
The entire base metals complex ignored Thursday's 237-point rally in the Do=
w Jones Industrial Average, dealers said.=20
""Copper has been sensitive to moves in the stock market, but not this time,=
"" Norrish said. In fact, now it appears that base metals markets ignore equ=
ities markets when they rally, but follow stocks down when they slump, he a=
dded.=20
Aluminum also ended the late kerb lower Friday.=20
News of the restart of some smelters has dampened sentiment, despite a stoc=
k drawdown of around 8,000 tons since the end of last week, dealers said.=
=20
""The stock drawdowns are fairly small percentage-wise,"" said Standard Bank =
analyst Robin Bhar, adding that they would need to be much larger to signif=
icantly improve market sentiment.=20
""A test of $1,435/ton cannot be ruled out, though we would expect forward b=
uying to prevent a break below this level for the time being,"" Barclays sai=
d in a market report.=20
Zinc continued its slump, falling to a seven-and-a-half-year low, mainly on=
 technicals.=20
Technicals also hurt nickel, which rose slightly after breaking $5,900/ton =
support but still closed at its lowest level since April.=20
Nickel's fall was ""just on some speculative liquidation and short selling, =
mostly chart-based,"" Bhar said.=20

Futures Contract Covering Coal Debuts in New York (Correct)

Futures Contract Covering Coal Debuts in New York (Correct)

     (Corrects location of FirstEnergy Corp. in 10th paragraph of
story that moved yesterday.)

     New York, July 12 (Bloomberg) -- The New York Mercantile
Exchange today began trading a futures contract for low-sulfur
coal, a fuel that President George W. Bush said will play a major
role in meeting electricity demand over the next two decades.
     The contract's debut came after prices for coal, considered
the dirtiest of power-plant fuels, doubled in the past year, as
demand from power plants outstripped mine production. Coal for
September delivery opened at $42 a ton and settled at $40.75, as
98 contracts were traded, exchange officials said.
     ``We had a big run-up in coal prices this past winter,'' said
Andy Ozley, who buys coal for Atlanta-based Mirant Corp.'s six
coal plants in New York, Illinois, Maryland and Virginia. ``This
contract affords us a way to mitigate our exposure'' to large
price swings.
     The Bush administration said in an energy policy report this
spring that coal would be the dominant fuel for electricity
generation through 2020. Bush gave an added boost to the fuel when
he retreated from a campaign pledge to restrict carbon dioxide
emissions, implicated in global warming.
     Coal plants are responsible for a third of the nation's
carbon dioxide emissions. They also produce sulfur dioxide, which
causes acid rain, and nitrogen oxides, which cause smog.
     The Nymex started the futures contract to give mining
companies and utilities a way to hedge their risks in the $33
billion coal market. Producers such as Peabody Energy Corp. and
Arch Coal Inc., whose shares have soared in the past year, have
said they would trade the futures.

                            New Plants

     Last year's quadrupling of prices for natural gas -- a
cleaner-burning power-plant fuel -- prompted many generators to
ramp up output from their coal plants. Utility coal stockpiles
dwindled, and prices have risen to their highest levels since at
least 1989.
     So far this year, more than a dozen companies have announced
plans to build coal-fired plants, including Kansas City, Missouri-
based Kansas City Power & Light Co. and Portland, Oregon-based
PacifiCorp.
     Although coal is used to produce 52 percent of the nation's
electricity, few plants were built during the 1990s because of the
high costs of building them and the difficulty of complying with
federal and local environmental regulations.
     Demand for coal has eased in recent weeks as below-normal
temperatures in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast reduced demand for
air conditioning, said Jim Parks, who buys coal for six power
plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania as director of fuels at Akron,
Ohio-based FirstEnergy Corp.
     ``The summer's been pretty mild so far -- you haven't seen
any big heat waves'' in regions with the most coal generation, he
said.

                           Big Sandy

     The Nymex futures contract calls for the delivery of 1,550
tons of low-sulfur coal to the mouth of the Big Sandy River near
Huntington, West Virginia. From there, the fuel would be loaded
onto Ohio River barges and shipped to power plants in the U.S. and
possibly Europe.
     The new contract is tailored to producers in Appalachian
states that account for about 40 percent of U.S. production,
including West Virginia, Kentucky and Pennsylvania, the No. 2, 3
and 4 coal producers.
     The industry lacks a futures contract for coal from Western
states that account for 47 percent of the nation's production,
including the No. 1 producer, Wyoming.

                         Avoiding the Past

     The exchange, which earns commissions on trades, hopes coal
futures will avoid the fate of other contracts it has started over
the past few years. Its six electricity futures contracts have
fizzled, as has its Middle East sour crude oil contract, which
debuted in May 2000.
     ``I said yesterday, if you traded 100 to 200 contracts, that
would be a really a good day,'' said Chris Casale, vice president
of energy trading at Dynegy Inc. in Houston, which trades coal and
buys the fuel for its six power plants in New York and Illinois.
``It came out sort of on target.''
     Most of today's trading was originated by large energy
marketing companies, he said, although he declined to say whether
Dynegy traded any contracts. Enron Corp., the largest energy
trader, and Duke Energy Corp., the largest U.S.-based utility
holding company, have said they would trade coal futures.
     Exchange officials have said the coal market has the
potential to reach 5,000 trades a day after a year of trading.
     The Nymex's 17-year-old crude oil futures contract averages
about 66,700 trades a day, and its 11-year-old natural gas
contract averages about 33,500.

                           Wary of Coal

     ``The coal market is still lacking liquidity,'' said Anthony
McAuley, a floor broker at ABN Amro Inc., who said he bought five
coal contracts for a client at $42 a ton -- the market's first
transaction. ``You probably need to see a little more
participation'' from industry coal buyers and sellers for the
market to take off.
     Independent floor traders, known as locals, are wary of
trading coal futures without assurances that the industry will be
active as well.
     ``Floor traders lost millions'' in electricity futures when
some were caught with high-priced contracts and nobody in the
industry to sell them to, he said.
     ``Because of that, people are a little bit tentative about
coal,'' said Tom Schiff, an independent crude oil trader. ``We're
here to help make liquidity but we can't tackle all the risk.''

=09=09 Modern Metals, July 2001    Giant energy concern now turns its atten=
tion to steel. The company's aggressive posture has begged controversy. Ind=
ustry reactions vary from hand-wringing to open arms. Still others characte=
rize Enron as a ""non-event."" By Michelle Martinez Arjona, Editor-in-Chief, =
and Paul Hohl, Contributing Editor  These days, saying the word ""Enron"" in =
a room full of metals executives is like screaming ""fire"" in a crowded thea=
ter. For most in the steel industry, the idea of a futures market is enough=
 to raise a few eyebrows. But when a major market maker with annual revenue=
s of 10 times the market cap of the U.S. steelmaking industry stakes a clai=
m (for 2000 alone, Enron logged revenues of $101 billion--that's with a ""b""=
), a lot more than eyebrows are likely to be raised. After a bold presentat=
ion from Jeff McMahon, president and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets, at th=
e SSCI annual convention in May (in which he accused steel mills of treatin=
g their service center customers as ""annoyances""), industry leaders rushed =
to understand this latest market contender.  Friend or foe? Competitor or p=
artner? These are just a couple of the questions surrounding Enron's aggres=
sive push into the metals industry. Judging from the service center and mil=
l executives Modern Metals queried, there are as many answers as there are =
opinions in the industry. Reactions ranged from fear to acceptance to downr=
ight resentment. At least one mill was reticent to discuss Enron at all--st=
ill others seemed to meet the issue with unaffected shrugs. If the saying i=
s true that all publicity is good publicity, the buzz that Enron has genera=
ted would make even a Hollywood spin doctor envious. What's the hubbub? Alt=
hough products such as natural gas and energy--Enron's major business platf=
orm--have been traded as commodities for years, until Enron's appearance a =
formal forward market for steel has never existed. According to McMahon, th=
e absence of a liquid and transparent market has resulted in ""uninformed in=
vestment decisions"" that have exacerbated the current oversupply situation,=
 and left companies exposed to the hazards of price volatility.  Enron's an=
swer is to offer a variety of financial hedging products along with forward=
 contracts in hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized (plate and long produc=
ts are soon to follow), locking in prices for as many as five years out. En=
ron contends that it can act as a ""risk intermediary"" in steel transactions=
, ensuring healthier profit margins and lowering the cost of capital. Certa=
in grades of steel are commodities, McMahon insists, and as such should be =
bought and sold on a commodity market basis, instead of the strategic relat=
ionships that now exist between the mills and consumers. Enron has been off=
ering steel online, and via phone and fax, since November of last year. ""Be=
fore you add capacity, before you make an investment decision, you'll be ab=
le to see a three, five, maybe even a 10-year forward price of steel,"" McMa=
hon stated, ""and if you want to hedge that investment you can do that."" The=
 company plans to buy steel at a floating price and then sell it to steel c=
onsumers at a fixed rate, making money on the spread. In February, Greg Her=
mans, VP of steel trading at Enron, reported to AMM that it was offering U.=
S.-made 10-gauge, 48-in. wide hot-rolled for April delivery in Chicago for =
$225 a ton. Hermans said Enron was buying the same product for April delive=
ry at $215 a ton.  Eventually, Enron sees the development of four different=
 marketplaces: the Northeast, the Midwest (or Chicago area), the Gulf Coast=
 (or Houston area), and the West Coast. Enron will hedge against spot price=
 spikes through equity and physical holdings in domestic mills. The company=
 closed on Huntco's Arkansas-based cold-rolling mill in June. ""It's a big p=
ortfolio,"" McMahon said. ""We wanted to put together a portfolio of supply a=
nd demand. In some cases, we'll own assets--hopefully we'll own some term c=
ontracts with domestic mills. To the extent that imports are a part of the =
equation, we'll be a part of that market. We may purchase capacity from som=
ebody, not necessarily the assets, but toll slab through a hot strip mill. =
All of those combined is how we do our business."" Steel mills can benefit, =
McMahon said, by entering into a multi-year ""physical off take"" with Enron,=
 thus giving steel mills a degree of certain volume and on product specific=
ation. Enron would guarantee purchase of a specified amount of tonnage, and=
 use a floating price or a floor price to guard against market shocks. Whet=
her mills would be willing to divert capacity to the commodity grades being=
 bought and sold by Enron remains uncertain. At least one mill executive pr=
ivately said no . . . at least for now. Nucor president, CEO and vice chair=
man, Dan DiMicco also sees little value in Enron's proposal. ""What we need =
to have is stable pricing at levels where the most efficient mills can make=
 a good return on their capital and further invest in new technologies and =
equipment,"" he stated. ""I define true value as helping the industry to beco=
me stronger. It doesn't do any good to maintain a lack of price volatility =
at $200 a ton."" Keith Busse, CEO at Steel Dynamics, echoed that sentiment i=
n a recent New Steel article. ""If you're trying to get volatility out at $3=
20 [per ton], great,"" he said. ""But at $230, you want to stick your fingers=
 down your throat."" For the service centers Service centers, McMahon sugges=
ted, could benefit immediately. ""The only way [distributors] are able to he=
dge themselves is to go out and buy inventory,"" he explained. ""That takes c=
apital, and cash, and space. We can offer a financial product that gives th=
e exact same protection, but doesn't require any of the above. ""We can hold=
 those inventories and price the steel at the time of delivery to the servi=
ce centers,"" he continued, ""so their 4- or 5- percent net margins are somew=
hat certain."" ""I do think that Enron is providing a service for the industr=
y . . . "" commented Dave Lerman, CEO of Steel Warehouse, South Bend, Indian=
a. But he pointed out that ""how [it] moves forward will be interesting. If =
they just move forward with hedge instruments . . . that's independent of w=
hether you run your business well by having a good supplier that matches up=
 with the demands of your customers. I think [Enron] will be a good thing f=
or some people and a non-event for others."" Beyond hedging, McMahon pointed=
 out, firm and enforceable contracts could become a key benefit to service =
centers. As one Midwestern distributor source commented, ""One of the terrib=
le things that happens in our business is that end users demand long-term p=
ricing, beyond what anybody can foresee. When they anticipate the market is=
 going up, or that it has hit a low point, they push harder for it--as any =
one would. But historically, they don't honor the deals.""  In a down market=
, he explained, customers demand lower prices. Noncompliance can result in =
orders, but no releases, and a ""don't call us, we'll call you"" attitude fro=
m customers. The consequence for service centers, he said, are price reduct=
ions on the way down and on the way up. ""If Enron brings integrity to both =
sides of this market,"" he concluded, ""that would be a very big plus for the=
 steel industry."" But integrity, another Midwest service center exec counte=
red, has got nothing to do with it. In his estimation, Enron is like a prof=
iteering carpetbagger, ""trying to make a buck in between the producer and t=
he user. That's all we need right now,"" he declared, ""somebody trying to sq=
ueeze out a few more dollars."" But, he recognized, ""we're all going to have=
 to deal with it."" Don McNeeley, president and CEO of Chicago Tube & Iron, =
indicated that some good could come of a heavy-hitter like Enron introducin=
g new ideas into the industry, but acknowledged that people might be offend=
ed by somebody picking the so-called ""low-hanging fruit"" of the steel marke=
t in the current economy. ""What do you think the mills are going to do when=
 you come to them for just the peripheral items?"" he queried. ""My concern w=
ould be that the price would go up on [those items]."" McNeeley also questio=
ned the wisdom of distributors relinquishing control of their inventories. =
""In distribution, 60 percent of our net worth is inventory, 30 percent is a=
ccounts receivable, and 10 percent is plant property and equipment,"" he rel=
ated. ""Our single largest asset is our inventory. If a distribution company=
 surrenders control of its inventory to a third party, does not that distri=
butor, in effect, surrender its own sovereignty?"" Only just begun Questions=
 abound regarding Enron's role as a physical supplier of steel as well. As =
one Minnesota-based service center exec put it, ""are they ready to deal wit=
h problems?"" Although Enron has expressed interest in being a physical supp=
lier, Dave Lerman explained, ""I think that's going to be a lot more difficu=
lt to implement."" Enron would have to consider specific qualities, coil siz=
es, nuances of chemistry, surface quality, and formability. ""Most customers=
 require better than standard tolerances,"" he pointed out. ""These are all i=
ssues that might complicate commodity sales."" Delivery is another issue. As=
 a physical supplier, Enron has virtually guaranteed just-in-time delivery,=
 but as one service center source said, ""the guarantee is good when the mat=
erial shows up at my door. What happens if it doesn't show up? I disappoint=
 a customer. What good does it do to sue [Enron] if I've lost a customer?"" =
Mill executives have questioned whether Enron is a potential competitor. ""T=
hey see Enron as someone likely to buy foreign steel in order to deliver it=
 to a U.S. customer,"" said Chuck Bradford, principal of Bradford Research a=
nd a long-time industry observer. He cautioned against seeing Enron as too =
much of a physical supplier, speculating that the future of Enron, similar =
to the LME, will be in hedging. ""You may see some [physical transactions] t=
o start with,"" Bradford predicted, ""just to get the ball rolling. But I don=
't see that as the way the market will develop."" McMahon has been consisten=
t in saying that Enron has little interest in becoming a steel manufacturer=
. The real value, he said, is in a transparent, liquid market. ""We know the=
 products work, we know the market wants them. Can any one particular mill =
or mills prevent that? We don't think so,"" he said. ""It's not an 'if', it's=
 a 'when'."" The jury is still out on just how soon that ""when"" will come, a=
nd what those effects will be for the steel industry. And for all of the de=
bate surrounding the issue, it seems a bit soon to be hitting the panic but=
ton. As Don McNeeley recounted, ""I can recall similar controversy over a sp=
eech a guy gave about 15-17 years ago. That guy's name was Ken Iverson, and=
 he had this concept called a mini-mill. Look at it now."" =09

    Let me review where we stand for the April 10-11 meeting.
1.  I have spoken with Gavyn and asked him to add to his usual review 
comments on the significance of recent developments for Enron.
2.  I have asked Bill Kristol to do the same.
3.  I have asked Paul Portney to review ""the lay of the land"" in the 
environmental policy area.
4.  Since we couldn't locate a speaker to address the question of how Enron, 
now larger and more corporate than in the past, can continue to attract the 
best, the brightest (and the oddest?), I have asked Pankaj to give a brief 
talk about what the literature generated by his colleagues has to tell us on 
this subject.
5.  I couldn't get anyone on the ""monopoly-too-big-and-powerful"" question, 
although I am still trying.
I assume you folks will brief us on California and the national energy supply 
picture. Have we heard from the author of ""When Genius Fails""?

Would buying boycott help lower California's electricity bill?
By MICHAEL LIEDTKE
AP Business Writer

05/03/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - There's a limit to how much people will pay for most 
things in life. If the cost scares off enough buyers, prices eventually fall. 
So what would happen if this textbook example from Economics 101 were applied 
to California's electricity crisis? What if the state officials struggling to 
maintain energy supplies simply refused to buy power above a certain price 
and accepted more blackouts this summer?
The question would have been absurd just a few months ago and even now the 
notion seems surreal, given the possible consequences. 
Inviting even more blackouts inevitably would hurt businesses and frustrate 
consumers, threatening to further depress California's already slumping 
economy - the sixth largest in the world. 
But desperate times require drastic measures, according to the economists, 
lawmakers and activists who believe the state will be better off sitting in 
the dark than buying electricity at any price during a summer shortage likely 
to produce recurring blackouts anyway. 
""It's better to use (blackouts) and break the (wholesale energy) cartel than 
simply to suffer them,"" said Michael Shames, executive director of the 
Utility Consumer Action Network, a San Diego watchdog group. 
Refusing to buy enough power to keep the lights on ""would be like playing 
with fire,"" counters Wells Fargo & Co. chief economist Sung Won Sohn. 
""Blackouts aren't a just matter of inconvenience or being too hot or cold. 
They cost businesses a lot of money."" 
Buying electricity at the last minute to meet the state's power needs already 
has cost the California government $5.7 billion in the past 3 1/2 months. The 
state energy bill for 2001 could reach $50 billion, in money otherwise spent 
on education, public safety and health care, Shames said. 
Faced with the prospect of a significant budget deficit, some lawmakers think 
it's time for California to take a stand against the power wholesalers - many 
of whom are based outside the state. 
This Tuesday, the state Senate Energy Committee will consider authorizing the 
state to refuse to buy power above certain prices. Current law requires state 
electricity managers to avoid blackouts by buying all available power at any 
cost. 
""We have been over a barrel in so many ways,"" said Sen. Dede Alpert, 
D-Coronado, who sponsored SB73x. ""Maybe there's a point in the market where 
(we) just say no and go with the planned blackout strategy instead."" 
Economists give the bill little chance of succeeding. 
""It's never going to happen. It's not a viable option,"" said University of 
California at Berkeley Professor Severin Borenstein, one of the energy 
experts who have studied the idea. 
The business lost during blackouts would mean more layoffs in a state already 
skittish over the technology downturn and the looming Hollywood writers 
strike, economists say. 
Other ripple effects include diminished gasoline supplies, leading to even 
higher prices at the pump, and distribution headaches that could leave store 
shelves bare. 
And some consumers - the elderly and the infirm, for example, need power at 
any price. 
Without electricity, Manteca resident Betty Jarzemkoski said she wouldn't be 
able to help her ailing husband to get out of his motorized bed at home. 
""It would be a real hardship for us,"" said Jarzemkoski, 78. ""I'm on a fixed 
income so I hope they can figure out something to bring down prices. But we 
need power."" 
Despite such concerns, the concept of a buyer's boycott hasn't been flatly 
ruled out - at least publicly - by Gov. Gray Davis as he struggles to reduce 
the state's staggering electricity bill. 
The state is spending as much as $90 million per day to meet California's 
electricity needs and the bleeding is sure to get worse. When the summer heat 
increases demand and tightens supplies, California might spend more than $1 
billion each week, state officials estimate. 
Extended blackouts pose an even greater cost, economists say. 
When Northern California suffered rolling blackouts for several hours Jan. 
18-19, the economic losses totaled $2.3 billion, mostly from lost profits and 
wages, estimated the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp. 
Multiply that over several weeks across the entire state, and it becomes 
apparent why it makes more sense for California to continue buying power at 
inflated prices, even if leaves the state with deep debts and a ruined credit 
rating, economists argue. 
As it is, California probably won't be able to round up enough power at any 
price on some days this summer, making some blackouts a virtual certainty. 
The blackouts will reduce the state's economic output by $2 billion to $16 
billion, according to a study released last month by the Bay Area Economic 
Forum. 
The resolve of the state's politicians and ratepayers would be sorely tested 
for a boycott to succeed, much in the way that labor strikes boil down to 
whether workers or management can withstand more financial pain. 
""Politicians aren't going to willingly turn out the lights because 
politicians want to get re-elected,"" said Borenstein, director of the 
University of California's energy institute. ""As soon as people start losing 
their jobs because the power is off, the public will get tired of the 
blackouts real quick."" 
Still, Californians might tolerate an increase in blackouts if they 
understand why the state chose to pursue such a drastic course, said Stanford 
economics Professor Frank Wolak, who heads the Independent System Operator's 
market surveillance committee. 
""This isn't something you could do without an enormous public relations 
campaign,"" he said. ""The campaign would have to explain that the state had no 
other choice but to do this because (federal power regulators) aren't doing 
their job and enforcing the law against unjust and unreasonable prices."" 
The largest out-of-state generators are in such robust financial shape that 
it might take weeks before they would feel such pain from a California 
boycott that they would be forced to lower prices. 
After making record profits last year, power wholesalers Enron, Reliant, 
Dynegy, Duke Energy, Williams and Mirant and earned a combined $1.6 billion 
during the first three months of this year.

INDIA: Indian banks appeal to govt to help end Enron row

05/03/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
BOMBAY, May 3 (Reuters) - Indian lenders to U.S. energy group Enron Corp's 
gas-fired power plant south of Bombay have appealed to the Indian government 
to help end the company's row with a state-owned electricity board over 
pricing and upaid bills. 
The board of Enron's Indian unit, Dabhol Power Co (DPC) has authorised 
management to stop selling power to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board 
(MSEB) if a bitter dispute over pricing and unpaid bills cannot be resolved.
In the past half year the MSEB has defaulted on bills for electricity 
supplied by Dabhol, which operates the world's largest gas-fired plant on the 
west coast of India, 160 kilometres (100 miles) south of Bombay. 
Indian financial institutions, which contributed $1.4 billion towards the 
project in loans, are pressing the government to help end the crisis, a 
source told Reuters. 
""We have asked the government for help. We are awaiting their reply,"" the 
source, who is employed with a large financial institution, said. 
The domestic lenders to the project are Industrial Development Bank of India 
, ICICI Ltd , Industrial Finance Corporation of India , Canara Bank and State 
Bank of India . 
The Dabhol Power Company (DPC), owned 65 percent by Enron, last month took 
the major step of bailing out of the $2.9 billion power project, citing 
non-payment of bills by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). 
The DPC board's move sparked widespread fears that India's image as a safe 
destination for foreign direct investment would be damaged. 
POWER STRUGGLE 
MSEB, which is a state-owned utility, has been a regular defaulter on 
payments to DPC saying that it finds the power too costly. It has also backed 
out on its commitment to buy more power to be produced by the project's 
second phase which is to begin operations later this year. 
Last month MSEB said it had paid Dabhol Power 1.34 billion rupees ($28.60 
million) for electricity it bought in March. 
But the payment only partially resolves the total overdue amount of 2.26 
billion rupees ($48.2 million), which Enron has been unable to collect even 
after invoking guarantees issued by the government of Maharashtra, India's 
most industrialised state, and the federal government. 
The state utility still owes Enron payments for power purchases in December 
and January. 
The Indian government has maintained that the contract must be renegotiated 
and has set up a committee to do so. 
""We are concerned and would like the renegotiations to happen fast,"" the 
source added. 
The dispute has raised fears that Enron could pull the plug on the project, 
cease providing power to the local state electricity board and perhaps even 
sell the plant. 
""The plant is good, Maharashtra needs power and I am sure buyers can be 
found,"" the source added. ($1=46.82 Indian rupees).




DNC: Special Interests Write Bush Energy Policy

05/03/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

WASHINGTON, May 3 /PRNewswire/ -- The Democratic National Committee issued 
the following today: 
Dick Cheney began dropping hints this week as to what the Bush energy policy 
will look like, and it is long on oil and short on conservation. But 
something was missing from the coverage of Cheney's announcement: not just 
who benefits from the Bush plan, but who's writing it as well. (Photo: 
http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20000107/DCF015 ) 
It's hard to understate the influence big donors and high-ranking executives 
have with the Bush Administration. Take Tom Kuhn, for example, one of the 
energy executives who came calling when Bush was thinking about actually 
following through on his pledge to limit carbon dioxide levels. Kuhn, a top 
Bush fundraiser, also served on Bush's Energy Department transition advisory 
team, and still enjoys access to the highest reaches of the Bush White House. 
Not surprisingly then, the Big Oil Bush Administration's energy policy could 
not make Bush's huge donors and the special interests in the energy business 
any happier. Since the energy industry's problems are Bush's problems, the 
first things on Bush's hit list are the environmental regulations that keep 
Big Energy in check -- and our country clean. 
With an energy executive running around the West Wing, Bush's energy policy 
could be summed up as, ""Drill anywhere, anytime, and keep those checks 
coming."" 
The Democratic Party is committed to fighting for a balanced energy policy 
that keeps our country's priorities -- such as a clean environment -- in 
mind. 
To learn more about Bush's misplaced priorities and kowtows to the special 
interests, keep reading to find out the ""Top Ten Paybacks To The Energy 
Industry,"" and to see how you, too, can get on the Bush gravy train in 
""Recipe for a Quid Pro Quo,"" courtesy of the Democratic Party's 
http://www.100DaysofBush.com. 
BUSH'S TOP TEN PAYBACKS TO THE ENERGY INDUSTRY 
One of the most obvious and recurring themes of Bush's first 100 days has 
been the extraordinary influence the oil and gas industry has had in the new 
administration. Oil and gas interests are some of Bush's top campaign 
contributors, giving more than $3 million to get Bush elected. In exchange, 
Bush has rolled back regulations issued by the Clinton administration on such 
things as air conditioner efficiency, as well as breaking his campaign 
promise to regulate carbon dioxide emissions. Bush has proposed drilling in 
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and national monuments. Bush has taken a 
backseat when it comes to the energy crisis California is experiencing, while 
cutting funding for energy conservation programs. He has also repaid top 
donors, lobbyists and industry officials with key positions throughout his 
administration. 
Here is just a sampling of how the oil, gas and other energy industries have 
benefited in Bush's first 100 days: 
2 - BUSH TAKES HANDS-OFF APPROACH TO CALIFORNIA CRISIS WHILE ENERGY COMPANIES 
MAKE MILLIONS 
Bush Did Little to Aid California in Energy Crisis; Fleischer Said Crisis is 
a ""California Matter."" Bush has done little to aid California in its energy 
crisis, such as refusing to support wholesale price caps on electricity. 
White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said, ""The president continues to believe 
that the issue is mostly a California matter, dealing with the legislation 
that is before the state. And the leaders of California are working to 
address that in their own right."" Fleischer also said that Bush wanted to 
focus on a ""long term"" national energy policy. (AAP Newsfeed, 1/23/01; Wall 
Street Journal, 1/23/01) 
Texas Energy Company Accused of Price Gouging to Make Money off California's 
Energy Crisis. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered further 
inquiry into allegations by California officials that El Paso Natural Gas 
Co., a Houston based subsidiary of El Paso Energy Co., manipulated the 
natural gas market by keeping supply artificially low, contributing to the 
high price of electricity in the state. El Paso Energy was one of the Texas 
firms ""grandfathered"" by Bush's voluntary emissions standards in Texas. 
Between 1993 and 1998, El Paso Energy and El Paso Natural Gas PACs gave a 
total of $8,000 to Bush's gubernatorial campaigns. During the 1999-2000 
election cycle, El Paso Energy Corp. and El Paso Natural Gas Co. gave a total 
of $743,029 to Bush and the GOP -- $460,395 to GOP in soft money, $247,750 to 
GOP candidates from its PAC, and $34,884 to the Bush campaign from its 
employees and executives. (www.opensecrets.org; Los Angeles Times, 3/30/01; 
tebb.epenergy.com; Boston Globe, 10/3/99) 
Electricity Wholesalers Reported ""Gigantic Earnings Surges"" from Energy 
Crisis. According to the Los Angeles Times, several electricity wholesalers 
to California reported ""gigantic earnings surges"" for the quarter ended March 
31. The following companies, all contributors to Bush, have earned record 
profits off of the energy crisis in California. 
(Los Angeles Times, 4/18/01) 
COMPANY TOTAL TO BUSH COMPANY PROFIT 
Enron Corp. Enron is Bush's largest Enron's operating income was career 
patron, giving at $406 million in the first 
least $563,000 for his quarter of 2001, compared campaigns, including his 
with $338 million in the 1978 House campaign. same period last year, a 20% 
(San Diego Union-Tribune, increase.(Los Angeles Times, 2/11/01) 4/18/01) 

6 - BUSH'S TRANSITION TEAMS 
Energy Interests Dominated Bush Transition Energy Advisory Team. Big energy 
and oil firms dominated the Bush transition's Energy Advisory Team, having 
contributed $857,232 to the Republican Party and Bush during the campaign. 
(Center for Responsive Politics, www.crp.org) 
Almost Two-Thirds of Bush's Energy Transition Team Worked for Energy 
Industry. Out of the 48 members of the Bush Energy Department transition 
team, 31, or almost two-thirds, worked for the energy industry:

UK: INTERVIEW-Innogy starts trading power in mainland Europe
By Stuart Penson

Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - British utility Innogy said on Thursday it had 
started trading wholesale electricity on the French-Italian border and was 
set to enter the German power market. 
""We have done some wholesale trading on the Italy-France border, moving power 
from France to Italy, and we are very close to doing some in Germany,"" said 
director of trading Tony West in an interview with Reuters.
""This year we will significantly increase our trading in (mainland) Europe; 
we are discussing relationships with counterparties at the moment,"" he added. 
Innogy is building a European power trading team at its headquarters in 
Swindon, southern England, from where it already trades the UK gas and power 
markets. 
FRANCE COULD BE KEY MARKET 
West said the company initially had expected the main focus of its European 
trading strategy to be Germany and the north west of the continent. 
But the early signs were that France would also play a key role, particularly 
as Innogy had gained access to capacity in the UK-France undersea 
interconnector cable. 
""France has taken me by surprise. It might be more important than we 
anticipated although there are clearly still issues about the speed of 
liberalisation,"" said West. 
A core of about eight companies regularly trade power in France, including 
TXU Europe, Enron and a trading alliance between Endesa and Morgan Stanley 
Dean Witter, according to traders. 
West said Innogy had so far concentrated on buying power in France, not 
always from French companies, and taking it to Italy via the cross border 
interconnector between the two countries. 
Innogy had bought some of the 400-megawatts available on the interconnector 
through recent auctions, he said. 
""It's easy to trade through France, the cost of taking power through to the 
border is minuscule, although buying power in France and then selling it in 
France is a lot more difficult,"" said West. 
He said Innogy had signed grid balancing agreements with French transmission 
grid operator RTE. 
Andy Duff, managing director of generation and trading, added France could 
become become important for Innogy on a retail level, as well as a trading 
level, depending on how effectively the UK-France interconnector could be 
used. 
""The European market will be driven by the operation of interconnectors and 
transmission services as well as exchanges,"" said Duff. 
Innogy may look to trade on Germany's two power exchanges as well as that 
country's burgeoning over-the-counter market. 
The company is in the process of signing standard trading agreements for 
Germany based on the terms devised by the industry group the European 
Federation of Energy Traders (EFET). 
FOCUS ON TRADING, NOT ASSETS 
Duff said Innogy's strategy in Europe was to focus on trading but not the 
acquisition of physical assets. 
""We are not going to lead with assets in Europe. We will focus on trading 
services-type arrangements, extracting value from (other companies') assets. 
That's the main thrust of the business,"" he said. 
West said Innogy's trading in mainland Europe would expand into natural gas 
as opportunities emerged. The company already trades around the UK-Belgium 
gas interconnector.

European Phone Companies' Outlook Brightens: Rates of Return

European Phone Companies' Outlook Brightens: Rates of Return

     London, May 3 (Bloomberg) -- European telephone companies
such as British Telecommunications Plc and Deutsche Telekom AG
have improved their ability to pay back debt in recent weeks,
making their bonds a buy, investors said.
     ``Sentiment seems to be changing,'' said Anna Lees-Jones,
who helps manage about 28 billion pounds ($40 billion) of
corporate bonds at M&G Investment Management. ``I've been
building up my telecoms position all year.''
     British Telecom's 10-year euro-denominated bonds sold in
January yield about 214 basis points more than government debt,
down from a record 238 in March. Contracts that pay out if the
company goes bankrupt have also fallen in the past month,
according to Enron Corp., which trades the derivatives.
     Bond yields and bankruptcy derivatives have also declined for
Deutsche Telekom and Royal KPN NV, after the companies said they
would sell assets to pay down debt that has pushed their credit
ratings to record lows and weighed on their shares. Phone
companies sold $100 billion of bonds last year to finance licenses
and equipment for new mobile services.
     British Telecom said yesterday it will sell its stakes in
Japan Telecom Co. and Spain's Airtel SA to Vodafone Group for 4.8
billion pounds. British Telecom may also sell as much as 7.5
billion pounds of shares to existing investors in a so-called
rights offer, according to Legal & General Group Plc, one of the
company's shareholders.
     Deutsche Telekom will sell assets such as cable television,
and a stake in Global One and Wind SpA, Chief Financial Officer
Karl-Gerhard Eick said last week. KPN, the biggest Dutch phone
company, said on March 26 it plans to raise at least 5 billion
euros from asset sales to lower debt.
     Those plans have helped shift investors' perceptions of the
companies' creditworthiness, money managers said.

                       `Drastic Measures'

     ``At the beginning of the year the market was assuming
telecoms companies would be downgraded from single-A to triple-
B,'' said Peter Harvey, who helps run about $8.6 billion at F&C
Management. ``Drastic measures such as deeply-discounted rights
issues led investors to believe they will maintain their single-A
status.''
     The gap, or spread, between British Telecom's sterling
denominated bonds maturing in 2006, and U.K. five-year government
bonds has narrowed 50 basis points to 109 basis points in the
past month. Spreads between Deutsche Telekom's 6.125 percent five-
year euro bonds and German government debt narrowed 35 basis
points to 107 in April.

                      Bankruptcy Swaps Fall

     Those shifts in sentiment are also reflected in Enron's
bankruptcy swaps, where prices have fallen in the past month,
said Simon Brooks, a trader at Enron.
     Enron prices the swaps using indexes that measure the
probability of bankruptcy and the likely recovery rate in that
event. The price is expressed as a percentage above a benchmark
interest rate such as the London interbank offered rate, or
Libor.
     British Telecom bankruptcy swaps have declined to 66 basis
points from 96 on April 1, Enron said. Bankruptcy swaps on
Deutsche Telekom dropped to 78 from 100, while KPN's fell to 135
from 183. Over the same period, France Telecom SA's declined to
70 from 100 and Telecom Italia SpA's fell to 94 from 119.
     British Telecom's bond yields may fall further relative to
government debt, analysts said. They still offer higher yields
than those of rival Vodafone Group Plc, which has the same
ratings though with a stable outlook.
     While both companies have five-year euro-denominated bonds,
British Telecom's offer 55 basis points more yield. The rivals
also both have bonds maturing in 2004, and Vodafone's yield about
23 basis points fewer.
     ``If BT retains their rating, their spreads should be
probably 20 to 30 basis points narrower,'' said Brian Venables,
head of credit strategy at WestLB. ``Even though it has performed
extremely well this year, there is much greater potential for
BT's debt.''

                      Debt Reduction Target

     Both Moody's Investors Service, which rates British Telecom
``A2'', and Standard & Poor's, which rates it ``A'', have those
ratings on watch for further cuts after trimming them four rungs
last year.
     The company's asset sales to Vodafone are ``definitely
positive in terms of the rating assessment,'' said Aidan Fisher,
who rates British Telecom for Moody's. In combination with the
proceeds of a rights sale, ``that would meet the target they set
themselves this year -- that's quite a lot to achieve in a 12
month period.''
     British Telecom has said it wants to slash its 30 billion
pounds of debt by a third and fend off further rating cuts.
     Before companies such as British Telecom clarified their
debt-reduction plans, ``the world and his wife were underweight''
telecom bonds in March, said Harvey at F&C. The investment firm
has since raised its holding of telecom bonds to neutral, from
underweight, relative to its benchmark, he said.
     Bond yields ``were trading very much out of line to the rest
of the market,'' said Lees-Jones at M&G. Now, ``they have come in
quite a bit and will come in further.''

UK:Corporates warm to charms of credit derivatives
By Tom Bergin

05/03/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - European corporates are beginning to turn to credit 
derivatives, among the more esoteric and complex of financial instruments, to 
hedge the risk their debtors won't pay up, market participants said on 
Thursday.

Credit derivatives are insurance-like tools that allow users to hedge the 
risk of default on a debt. They are mainly used by banks, hedge funds and 
insurance companies to hedge or gain exposure to the risk of a bond issuer 
defaulting. Dealers said an environment of deteriorating credit quality and a 
growing awareness among corporates that credit derivatives offer certain 
advantages over established hedging tools was behind the increasing use of 
the instruments.

The market remains small, with only around a dozen non-financial European 
corporates regularly using credit derivatives to manage their credit 
portfolio at present. But market professionals predict they will one day 
become as commonplace in the corporate world as other hedging tools such as 
interest rate swaps and currency options.

""We see (corporate use) as a big growth area for credit derivatives, maybe 
the biggest,"" says Bryan Seyfried, vice-president of Enron Credit in London.

Enron Credit grew out of the efforts of energy company Enron Corp. to hedge 
its own credit risk portfolio and now specialises in marketing credit risk 
management solutions to other non-financial corporates.

Ralf Lierow, director of credit derivatives at Siemens Financial Services in 
Munich, said the ability to buy and sell in a liquid market means credit 
derivatives offer a flexibility that established tools like credit insurance 
and forfaiting guarantees lack. Credit derivatives were are often cheaper 
than the alternatives, too, he added.

""This is not a trading book thing. For us, the credit default swap is another 
tool for credit risk management,"" Lierow said.

HELPS OPERATIONAL UNITS DO MORE BUSINESS

Siemens Financial Services acts as the centralised risk portfolio management 
operation for companies within the Siemens electronics and industrial group. 
It first started using credit derivatives in July 2000.

Large companies like Siemens can have hundreds of millions of dollars in 
receivables on their books at any time. The efficiency with which these 
companies manage the credit risk on their receivables has an impact on their 
day to day business.

""The advantage for the operative area is that they can offload more 
receivables and do more business,"" Lierow said.

Siemens uses credit default swaps, the most liquid type of credit 
derivatives, to hedge its portfolio of debtors on a constant basis. As the 
balance of cash owed by each name fluctuates over time, the company tries to 
match this with
default swap positions. Hence, if a customer fails to pay, Siemens can recoup 
the debt from the default swap seller.

Other companies use credit derivatives less frequently.

""There are occasional corporate users that have secured one-off requirements 
for balance-sheet management aims or to strip out the credit risk of a 
commercial transaction,"" said Walter Gontarek, head of global credit products 
at RBC Dominion Securities.

By hedging a country or company risk which a corporate may not be comfortable 
in carrying, a credit derivative can facilitate a project that may otherwise 
be unfeasible, dealers said.

NOT PUT OFF BY BAD PRESS

Corporates' adoption of credit derivatives is in spite of the negative 
publicity the instruments have received in recent years. A number of disputes 
over whether protection buyers could force banks to pay up on contracts have 
ended up in court. However, traders insist that subsequent work done on 
contract documentation minimises the risk of such disputes in future. 

Nonetheless a very practical concern for corporates remains, in that credit 
derivatives documentation was designed by bankers with sovereign and 
corporate bonds in mind. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association 
(ISDA)
standard documentation for credit default swaps allows for a pay-out in 
relation to defaults on bond payments but not on a private debtor's failure 
to pay.

""We use the ISDA framework but we need it redrafted in specific ways to fit 
our needs. You cannot take a standard contract and trade on it if you want to 
hedge trade receivables,"" Lierow said. These amendments add to the cost of the
credit derivative.

Another problem that corporates face is the complexity of credit derivatives. 
There is little experience of the instruments, which are barely a decade old, 
in the corporate world. Siemens had to get its expertise from the financial 
markets, hiring Lierow from Bankgesellschaft Berlin.

Clive Banks, UK head of derivatives sales to buy-side clients at Schroder 
Salomon Smith Barney, said much of the effort in marketing credit derivatives 
to corporates involves educating them about the products and the risks 
involved.

""It's about explaining credit risk management and what kind of volatility and 
cost having credit risk introduces,"" he said.

OUTLOOK PROMISING

Yet some corporates are beginning to take full advantage of their new tool. 
Lierow said that Siemens, which currently only buys credit protection, 
planned to start acting as a default swaps seller in the coming months.

He said selling would facilitate better matching of protection levels to 
actual exposures, and would enable diversification of risk away from industry 
sectors where the company's activities are concentrated.

""You could improve the portfolio mix by buying protection on automotives and 
selling protection on pharmaceuticals,"" he said.

HAGRSTOWN, Md. -(Dow Jones)- Allegheny Energy Inc.'s (AYE) Allegheny Energy 
Supply Co. unit purchased 1,710 megawatts of natural gas-fired merchant 
generating capacity in three Midwest states from Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Enron 
North America unit. 
Financial terms weren't disclosed.
In a press release Thursday, Allegheny said it financed the acquisition 
through debt and equity and expects the purchase to add to earnings in 2001, 
excluding transaction costs. 
Allegheny noted that this latest acquisition gives Allegheny Energy Supply 
more than 14,000 MW of total generating capacity that it will own or control 
by 2005. 
Allegheny Energy Global Markets will market output from the three facilities. 
On April 27, Allegheny priced its public offering of 12.4 million shares at 
$48.25 each, and said it would use the $598.3 million in gross proceeds to 
fund its previously reported acquisition of generating facilities located in 
the Midwest and for other corporate purposes. 
New York Stock Exchange-listed shares of Allegheny recently traded at $49.85, 
down 51 cents, or 1%, on composite volume of 306,000 shares. Average daily 
volume is 538,773 shares. 
Allegheny, which posted an operating net of $313.7 million, or $2.84 a share, 
on revenue of $4.01 billion for the year ended Dec. 31, is an energy company.

Allegheny Energy Supply Completes Purchase of Midwest Assets; Adds 1,700 MW 
to Growing Generation Fleet

05/03/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

HAGERSTOWN, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 3, 2001--Allegheny Energy, Inc. (NYSE: 
AYE) today announced that its unregulated generation subsidiary, Allegheny 
Energy Supply Company, LLC, has completed the purchase of 1,710 megawatts of 
natural gas-fired merchant generating capacity in three Midwest states from 
Enron North America, a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE). 
The acquisition gives Allegheny Energy more than 14,000 MW of total 
generating capacity that it will own or control by 2005 and marks a 
significant step in the Company's strategic course toward becoming a national 
energy supplier.
Earlier this year, Allegheny Energy Supply acquired 83 MW of coal-fired 
generation in the Conemaugh Generating Facility near Johnstown, Pa. 
Additionally, the Company has announced plans to build a 1,080-MW natural gas 
combined-cycle plant in La Paz County, Ariz.; a 630-MW natural gas 
combined-cycle facility near South Bend, Ind.; and a 540-MW natural gas fired 
combined-cycle generating facility in Springdale, Pa. Another 220 MW of 
peaking capacity have already been completed in Pennsylvania. 
The Midwest acquisition was financed through a combination of debt and equity 
and will be accretive to Allegheny Energy's earnings in 2001, excluding 
transaction costs and other costs related to the integration. Yesterday, the 
Company issued more than 14 million shares of common stock to facilitate the 
transaction. 
Alan J. Noia, Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer 
of Allegheny Energy, said, ""I am pleased to announce the closing of Allegheny 
Energy's largest generation acquisition to date. It provides our Company with 
significant generation presence and capability as an energy merchant to sell 
electricity from efficient natural gas-fired generation facilities in more 
areas of the country with a growing demand for energy."" 
Output from the three facilities will be marketed by Allegheny Energy Global 
Markets. 
""These premium generating assets are designed for operation in times of peak 
electricity demand,"" said Noia. ""Because of its national presence, Allegheny 
Energy Global Markets will be able to market the output from these newly 
acquired facilities in a wide variety of ways with our portfolio of existing 
assets and other supply arrangements so that overall operational efficiency 
and shareholder value is maximized."" 
Allegheny Energy Supply's newly acquired facilities include: the Gleason, 
Tenn., plant (546 MW), approximately 40 miles north of Jackson, Tenn.; the 
Wheatland, Ind., plant (508 MW), approximately 70 miles northeast of 
Evansville, Ind.; and the Lincoln Energy Center plant (656 MW) in Manhattan, 
Ill., near Chicago. These assets give Allegheny Energy Supply additional 
generating capacity within the East Central Area Reliability region (ECAR) 
and initial generation sources in the Mid-America Interconnected Network 
(MAIN) and the Southeastern Electric Reliability Council (SERC).

SSB Cuts Forecast For Power Profitability In 2002, Beyond

05/03/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Salomon Smith Barney's utility analysts sharply cut 
their forecast of the profitability of generating electricity in the U.S. in 
2002 and beyond because power prices are expected to drop more sharply than 
natural gas prices starting next year. 
The analysts cut the profit margin in natural gas-fired power in 2003 to 
$3.98 a megawatt-hour from $8.73/MWh, a 54% difference from their last 
forecast in February. They lowered their power price index for 2002 by 1.5% 
and for 2003 by 7.1% Thursday in a published report. Their forecast is based 
on forward markets for electricity and gas.
""Gas prices are remaining strong for a much longer period of time, while 
power prices drop off,"" senior electricity industry analyst Raymond Niles 
said in a telephone conference with investors. 
As a result, stock prices for power producers such as AES Corp. (AES), Mirant 
(MIR), Calpine Corp. (CPN) and NRG Energy (NRG) could peak this summer in 
advance of strong third quarter earnings reports, the Salomon report says. 
""Investors may still shy away from asset and investment-heavy power producers 
if realized prices begin to reflect the decreases in power prices now 
projected in the forward curve,"" the report warns. 
After this summer, the stocks of energy companies that focus more on trading 
will regain momentum, Salomon expects. These ""energy merchant"" companies, 
such as Enron Corp. (ENE), Williams Cos. (WMB), Duke Energy (DUK) and Dynegy 
(DYN), should be able to take advantage of higher trading volume and greater 
volatility in power markets in non-summer months, according to Salomon. 
""We expect (annual trading) volumes to grow, industry-wide, between 25% and 
40%, on average, during 2001-03, as the $800 billion global energy commodity 
market continues to open,"" the report predicts. 
The overall electricity price trend is national, according to Salomon. The 
report, titled ""Power Curve,"" expects 2001 wholesale power prices to exceed 
last year's by 131% in the West and by 34% on average in the eastern U.S., 
including Texas. But since their last forecast, the analysts lowered their 
forward price curve for next year and beyond in 10 of 11 regional power 
pools. 
""Interestingly, the exception to that is the New York Power Pool,"" Niles told 
investors. 
For the remainder of this year, however, Salomon still expects power 
producers to beat substantially last year's breakthrough results. 
""About 50% of the spike upward in western U.S. power prices the past six 
months has been from something we've never seen before in this industry: 
political and credit risk,"" Niles said in the conference. 
Western merchant power suppliers are benefitting from the ""unholy mess in 
California,"" Niles said, but that won't last forever. 
""Whenever the debate tapers off and we have a resolution in sight, that 
premium will slowly drain out of the western markets, and bring down 
profitability for the group,"" Niles said. 
National calls for reregulation due to the California crisis could continue 
to hurt stock prices for the entire sector, even though reregulation won't 
happen. Further, in so far as such calls discourage investment in generating 
plants, transmission lines and gas pipelines, they could also extend the 
current period of extremely high earnings, according to the report. 
In non-western states, the greatest profitability from power generation for 
the next two years is seen in New England.

Fitch Affs Northern Border; Rtg Outlook To Stable From Negative

05/03/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 3, 2001--Fitch has affirmed its `BBB+' senior 
debt rating for Northern Border Partners, L.P. (NBP) and its `A-` senior debt 
rating for its regulated pipeline affiliate Northern Border Pipeline Co. 
(NBPL). 
The Rating Outlook for both companies is changed to Stable from Negative. The 
rating action was taken after a review of NBP's recent acquisitions and 
long-term business plan. A combination of debt and equity at NBP was used to 
fund the recent acquisitions of Bear Paw, LLC, Midwestern Gas Transmission 
Company, and Dynegy Canada midstream assets. An additional $125-150 million 
of equity is expected to be sold in the coming months to pay down short-term 
debt and complete the permanent financing.
The improvement in Rating Outlook primarily reflects NBP's demonstrated 
commitment to undertake conservative long-term financing and operating 
strategies. Future acquisitions at the partnership level are expected to be 
financed 50/50, debt/equity so as to maintain financial flexibility and a 
stable credit profile. Moreover, management has shown a strong bias to 
minimize commodity price risk as it expands its non-regulated gas operations. 
For example, processing contracts for Bear Paw's four processing facilities 
are contracted for on a percentage of proceeds basis and liquids prices have 
been 90% hedged by NBP through 2001, limiting downside exposure. 
NBPL continues to exhibit strong competitive market, operating, and financial 
characteristics that are consistent with its current `A-` rating. The company 
is a low-cost transporter of Canadian gas into the Midwest, with costs per 
hundred miles of less than 4 cents per mcf. The December 2000 completion of 
the Alliance Pipeline has had minimal impact on Northern Border as capacity 
utilization approaches 100%. Pipeline capacity is 99% subscribed through 
mid-September 2003. Its shippers are financially strong customers with 
uniform take-or-pay contracts. The company has never written off a bad debt. 
NBPL should generate EBITDA/interest coverage of nearly 4.0 times over the 
next few years. 
Credit concerns primarily relate to NBP's changing business mix and the 
expectation of increased market risk associated with its growing midstream 
operations as compared with the stable, low-risk profile of NBPL. While 
projected consolidated and stand alone credit measures at NBP remain 
relatively strong, there will be less predictability in the future cash 
stream utilized to service debt. 
NBP is a publicly traded master limited partnership. Its primary holding is a 
70% economic interest in NBPL, a 1,214-mile FERC regulated interstate 
pipeline transporting natural gas from the Canadian border to the upper 
Midwest. Enron Corp. and The Williams Companies, Inc. hold a 10.0% and 3.3% 
stake in NBP, respectively, with the remainder publicly held. Enron controls 
an 82.5% stake in the management committee of NBP with Williams holding the 
remaining management allocation.

that its officials would meet members of a government panel formed to 
re-negotiate a troubled $2.9 billion power project in western India. 
But the willingness to meet the panel next week should not be construed as an 
offer to renegotiate the contract, Dabhol Power Company (DPC) said in a 
statement.
""As a matter of courtesy we have agreed to meet with them next week,"" the DPC 
statement said. ""Since the purpose of our meeting is to hear out the 
committee and understand their thoughts, we will not present any proposal."" 
DPC said it had constantly maintained that it was open to maintaining a 
dialogue towards resolving issues. 
""(But) This meeting should in no manner be construed as an open offer from 
DPC to renegotiate the terms of the contract,"" it added. 
DPC and the government of the western state of Maharashtra have been locked 
in a payment battle for months, with the state's electricity board balking at 
paying Enron what it considers too high a rate for electricity. 
At present, Maharashtra's State Electricity Board (MSEB) owes the DPC, of 
which Enron is a 65 percent stakeholder, some $48 million for power. 
The Maharashtra government last week announced the formation of a panel of 
experts to re-negotiate its contract with DPC and lower the cost of power 
sold to MSEB. 
LARGEST FOREIGN INVESTMENT 
The Dabhol project, the single largest foreign investment in India, consists 
of two phases, the already-built 740 megawatt power plant and a 1,444 MW 
plant that is expected to be finished this year. 
Last week, Dabhol's board authorised the plant's managing director to issue a 
preliminary notice of termination of service to MSEB. The notice, which has 
not been issued, would be the first step for Enron to pull out of the 
project. 
Earlier, a source familiar with the project told Reuters that Indian lenders, 
who have provided millions of dollars to Houston-based Enron to build DPC are 
lobbying with the government to act quickly and end the crisis. 
""We have asked the government for help. We are awaiting their reply,"" the 
source, who is employed with a large financial institution, said. 
The domestic lenders to the project are Industrial Development Bank of India 
, ICICI Ltd , Industrial Finance Corporation of India , Canara Bank and State 
Bank of India . 
If Enron pulls out of the project, the source said, the lenders would have no 
choice but to seek an alternative buyer. 
""The plant is good, Maharashtra needs power and I am sure buyers can be 
found,"" the source added.

The Bottom Line: Scottish Power Looks To Refine Focus
By Andrea Chipman
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

05/03/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- After more than a year of lagging earnings, investment 
missteps and unexpected disasters, U.K. vertically-integrated utility 
Scottish Power (SPI) is hoping a new strategy to streamline its businesses 
will signal a more focused period for the company. 
But it's got its work cut out. While investors were cheered by news that its 
U.S. Utah-based Hunter power plant is back online after a six-month outage 
that cost the company an estimated $160 million, uncertainty over its plans 
for its Southern Water unit and apparent ongoing commitment to loss-making 
telecoms venture Thus are seen as muddling group focus.
""It all adds up - the lack of coherent strategy, quite substantial downgrades 
and a whole host of non-core businesses that they don't have any natural 
management flair or expertise in,"" said Brian Gallagher, a senior fund 
manager at London-based Gartmore Investment Management, which has GBP3 
million of Scottish Power shares in its Global Utilities Fund. ""We have a 
reasonably low opinion of the company."" 
The company said Thursday that its pretax profit before goodwill amortization 
and exceptional items for the fiscal year ending March 31 fell to GBP628 
million from GBP736 million a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share declined 
to 30.65 pence in the 2001 fiscal year from 41.22 pence in 2000. 
The company acknowledged profits have been hit hard by the Hunter outage, 
competition on wholesale and retail markets in the U.K. and strict price 
controls on its regulated infrastructure businesses. 
Although the company's shares were trading at 458.5 pence after the release 
of Thursday's earnings results, up from 441.5 pence Wednesday, they are down 
more than 15% from 533 pence a year ago. 
Executives say they are restructuring the business into three targeted 
divisions to capitalize on its traditional strengths in generation and power 
supply and infrastructure and to expand its overseas activities. 
""We've now got a trading and commercial link between generation and supply 
and the first thing we are doing is putting emphasis on that...on growing 
earnings across that value chain,"" Scottish Power Chief Executive Ian Russell 
told journalists in a conference call Thursday. ""In the U.S., we are focused 
on cost cutting and on acquiring new businesses."" 
Scottish Power's move away from a full multi-utility profile - begun last 
year with its partial disposal of Thus and its withdrawal from an Internet 
banking venture with the Royal Bank of Scotland - toward a more narrowly 
focused energy business mimics a trend across the industry toward greater 
specialization. 
The company is also considering selling Southern Water, which would allow it 
to focus even more closely on its power business. 
Yet analysts and investors say they are looking for more details of the 
company's overall growth strategy from Russell, who took over as chief 
executive last month, and other managers. The toll from months of drift, is 
evident, they said. 
Sales Of Southern Water, Thus Seen 
Indeed, despite its efforts to chart a new road, Scottish Power appears to be 
reluctant to acknowledge the failure of some of its non-core ventures. 
Russell said his company remains ""supportive"" of Thus, which reported a 2000 
fiscal year loss of GBP21.4 million this week, and has no plans to exit its 
remaining 50% stake in the company. 
Similarly, he said, Scottish Power hasn't yet made a final decision to 
dispose of Southern Water - which has cut costs under its Scottish parent but 
is increasingly unable to cover its capital expenditure - although he said 
the company had received ""a number of offers"" from potential buyers. Although 
he declined to identify any of the bidders, Italian energy company Enel SpA 
(ENI) has confirmed its interest. 
Industry sources said a prompt sale of the water unit looks likely, with some 
bids already exceeding the GBP2 billion at which many analysts value the 
company's combined assets and debt. It's unclear, they said, how Southern 
Water or Thus would fit into Scottish Power's new image. 
""Scottish Power sees itself as an international energy company,"" a source 
familiar with the company said. In a year's time, he added, ""it would be 
unlikely that Southern Water and Thus would be part of the company."" 
Revenues from the sale of the water unit would also help Scottish Power 
pursue its U.S. expansion without adding to its 90% gearing levels, analysts 
and investors said. 
Russell declined to comment on reports Scottish Power is considering buying 
Enron Corp.'s Oregon-based unit, Portland General, but admitted the company 
would be a logical geographical fit with Pacificorp. 
Analysts said Scottish Power's plans for U.S. growth is likely to be a key 
part of its energy strategy. 
""We like their U.S. strategy where they've leveraged expertise gained in the 
highly competitive U.K. market,"" said Gareth Lewis-Davies, head of utilities 
research at Lehman Brothers in London. 
Closer to home, competition and the trend toward increased specialization in 
the power industry may force Scottish Power to determine whether its business 
strength lies in asset management or retail and generation. 
""Strategic decisions need to be made, and I'm not sure if they are going to 
make them in the near term or not,"" said Andrew Wright, U.K. utilities 
analyst at UBS Warburg in London. ""They are pretty much involved across the 
value chain, and I think it remains to be seen which part of the value chain 
they specialize in, if any.""

By MICHAEL LIEDTKE AP Business Writer 05/03/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - There's a limit to how much people will pay for most things in life. If the cost scares off enough buyers, prices eventually fall. So what would happen if this textbook example from Economics 101 were applied to California's electricity crisis? What if the state officials struggling to maintain energy supplies simply refused to buy power above a certain price and accepted more blackouts this summer? The question would have been absurd just a few months ago and even now the notion seems surreal, given the possible consequences. Inviting even more blackouts inevitably would hurt businesses and frustrate consumers, threatening to further depress California's already slumping economy - the sixth largest in the world. But desperate times require drastic measures, according to the economists, lawmakers and activists who believe the state will be better off sitting in the dark than buying electricity at any price during a summer shortage likely to produce recurring blackouts anyway. ""It's better to use (blackouts) and break the (wholesale energy) cartel than simply to suffer them,"" said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumer Action Network, a San Diego watchdog group. Refusing to buy enough power to keep the lights on ""would be like playing with fire,"" counters Wells Fargo & Co. chief economist Sung Won Sohn. ""Blackouts aren't a just matter of inconvenience or being too hot or cold. They cost businesses a lot of money."" Buying electricity at the last minute to meet the state's power needs already has cost the California government $5.7 billion in the past 3 1/2 months. The state energy bill for 2001 could reach $50 billion, in money otherwise spent on education, public safety and health care, Shames said. Faced with the prospect of a significant budget deficit, some lawmakers think it's time for California to take a stand against the power wholesalers - many of whom are based outside the state. This Tuesday, the state Senate Energy Committee will consider authorizing the state to refuse to buy power above certain prices. Current law requires state electricity managers to avoid blackouts by buying all available power at any cost. ""We have been over a barrel in so many ways,"" said Sen. Dede Alpert, D-Coronado, who sponsored SB73x. ""Maybe there's a point in the market where (we) just say no and go with the planned blackout strategy instead."" Economists give the bill little chance of succeeding. ""It's never going to happen. It's not a viable option,"" said University of California at Berkeley Professor Severin Borenstein, one of the energy experts who have studied the idea. The business lost during blackouts would mean more layoffs in a state already skittish over the technology downturn and the looming Hollywood writers strike, economists say. Other ripple effects include diminished gasoline supplies, leading to even higher prices at the pump, and distribution headaches that could leave store shelves bare. And some consumers - the elderly and the infirm, for example, need power at any price. Without electricity, Manteca resident Betty Jarzemkoski said she wouldn't be able to help her ailing husband to get out of his motorized bed at home. ""It would be a real hardship for us,"" said Jarzemkoski, 78. ""I'm on a fixed income so I hope they can figure out something to bring down prices. But we need power."" Despite such concerns, the concept of a buyer's boycott hasn't been flatly ruled out - at least publicly - by Gov. Gray Davis as he struggles to reduce the state's staggering electricity bill. The state is spending as much as $90 million per day to meet California's electricity needs and the bleeding is sure to get worse. When the summer heat increases demand and tightens supplies, California might spend more than $1 billion each week, state officials estimate. Extended blackouts pose an even greater cost, economists say. When Northern California suffered rolling blackouts for several hours Jan. 18-19, the economic losses totaled $2.3 billion, mostly from lost profits and wages, estimated the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp. Multiply that over several weeks across the entire state, and it becomes apparent why it makes more sense for California to continue buying power at inflated prices, even if leaves the state with deep debts and a ruined credit rating, economists argue. As it is, California probably won't be able to round up enough power at any price on some days this summer, making some blackouts a virtual certainty. The blackouts will reduce the state's economic output by $2 billion to $16 billion, according to a study released last month by the Bay Area Economic Forum. The resolve of the state's politicians and ratepayers would be sorely tested for a boycott to succeed, much in the way that labor strikes boil down to whether workers or management can withstand more financial pain. ""Politicians aren't going to willingly turn out the lights because politicians want to get re-elected,"" said Borenstein, director of the University of California's energy institute. ""As soon as people start losing their jobs because the power is off, the public will get tired of the blackouts real quick."" Still, Californians might tolerate an increase in blackouts if they understand why the state chose to pursue such a drastic course, said Stanford economics Professor Frank Wolak, who heads the Independent System Operator's market surveillance committee. ""This isn't something you could do without an enormous public relations campaign,"" he said. ""The campaign would have to explain that the state had no other choice but to do this because (federal power regulators) aren't doing their job and enforcing the law against unjust and unreasonable prices."" The largest out-of-state generators are in such robust financial shape that it might take weeks before they would feel such pain from a California boycott that they would be forced to lower prices. After making record profits last year, power wholesalers Enron, Reliant, Dynegy, Duke Energy, Williams and Mirant and earned a combined $1.6 billion during the first three months of this year. --- On The Net: Bay Area Economic Forum report: http://www.bayareacouncil.org/ppi/enp/enp-mid.html Electric Power Research Institute: http://www.epri.com Utility Consumers' Action Network Report: http://www.ucan.org/cartelrep2.htm INDIA: Indian banks appeal to govt to help end Enron row 05/03/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. BOMBAY, May 3 (Reuters) - Indian lenders to U.S. energy group Enron Corp's gas-fired power plant south of Bombay have appealed to the Indian government to help end the company's row with a state-owned electricity board over pricing and upaid bills. The board of Enron's Indian unit, Dabhol Power Co (DPC) has authorised management to stop selling power to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) if a bitter dispute over pricing and unpaid bills cannot be resolved. In the past half year the MSEB has defaulted on bills for electricity supplied by Dabhol, which operates the world's largest gas-fired plant on the west coast of India, 160 kilometres (100 miles) south of Bombay. Indian financial institutions, which contributed $1.4 billion towards the project in loans, are pressing the government to help end the crisis, a source told Reuters. ""We have asked the government for help. We are awaiting their reply,"" the source, who is employed with a large financial institution, said. The domestic lenders to the project are Industrial Development Bank of India , ICICI Ltd , Industrial Finance Corporation of India , Canara Bank and State Bank of India . The Dabhol Power Company (DPC), owned 65 percent by Enron, last month took the major step of bailing out of the $2.9 billion power project, citing non-payment of bills by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). The DPC board's move sparked widespread fears that India's image as a safe destination for foreign direct investment would be damaged. POWER STRUGGLE MSEB, which is a state-owned utility, has been a regular defaulter on payments to DPC saying that it finds the power too costly. It has also backed out on its commitment to buy more power to be produced by the project's second phase which is to begin operations later this year. Last month MSEB said it had paid Dabhol Power 1.34 billion rupees ($28.60 million) for electricity it bought in March. But the payment only partially resolves the total overdue amount of 2.26 billion rupees ($48.2 million), which Enron has been unable to collect even after invoking guarantees issued by the government of Maharashtra, India's most industrialised state, and the federal government. The state utility still owes Enron payments for power purchases in December and January. The Indian government has maintained that the contract must be renegotiated and has set up a committee to do so. ""We are concerned and would like the renegotiations to happen fast,"" the source added. The dispute has raised fears that Enron could pull the plug on the project, cease providing power to the local state electricity board and perhaps even sell the plant. ""The plant is good, Maharashtra needs power and I am sure buyers can be found,"" the source added. ($1=46.82 Indian rupees). DNC: Special Interests Write Bush Energy Policy 05/03/2001 PR Newswire (Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire) WASHINGTON, May 3 /PRNewswire/ -- The Democratic National Committee issued the following today: Dick Cheney began dropping hints this week as to what the Bush energy policy will look like, and it is long on oil and short on conservation. But something was missing from the coverage of Cheney's announcement: not just who benefits from the Bush plan, but who's writing it as well. (Photo: http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20000107/DCF015 ) It's hard to understate the influence big donors and high-ranking executives have with the Bush Administration. Take Tom Kuhn, for example, one of the energy executives who came calling when Bush was thinking about actually following through on his pledge to limit carbon dioxide levels. Kuhn, a top Bush fundraiser, also served on Bush's Energy Department transition advisory team, and still enjoys access to the highest reaches of the Bush White House. Not surprisingly then, the Big Oil Bush Administration's energy policy could not make Bush's huge donors and the special interests in the energy business any happier. Since the energy industry's problems are Bush's problems, the first things on Bush's hit list are the environmental regulations that keep Big Energy in check -- and our country clean. With an energy executive running around the West Wing, Bush's energy policy could be summed up as, ""Drill anywhere, anytime, and keep those checks coming."" The Democratic Party is committed to fighting for a balanced energy policy that keeps our country's priorities -- such as a clean environment -- in mind. To learn more about Bush's misplaced priorities and kowtows to the special interests, keep reading to find out the ""Top Ten Paybacks To The Energy Industry,"" and to see how you, too, can get on the Bush gravy train in ""Recipe for a Quid Pro Quo,"" courtesy of the Democratic Party's http://www.100DaysofBush.com. BUSH'S TOP TEN PAYBACKS TO THE ENERGY INDUSTRY One of the most obvious and recurring themes of Bush's first 100 days has been the extraordinary influence the oil and gas industry has had in the new administration. Oil and gas interests are some of Bush's top campaign contributors, giving more than $3 million to get Bush elected. In exchange, Bush has rolled back regulations issued by the Clinton administration on such things as air conditioner efficiency, as well as breaking his campaign promise to regulate carbon dioxide emissions. Bush has proposed drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and national monuments. Bush has taken a backseat when it comes to the energy crisis California is experiencing, while cutting funding for energy conservation programs. He has also repaid top donors, lobbyists and industry officials with key positions throughout his administration. Here is just a sampling of how the oil, gas and other energy industries have benefited in Bush's first 100 days: 2 - BUSH TAKES HANDS-OFF APPROACH TO CALIFORNIA CRISIS WHILE ENERGY COMPANIES MAKE MILLIONS Bush Did Little to Aid California in Energy Crisis; Fleischer Said Crisis is a ""California Matter."" Bush has done little to aid California in its energy crisis, such as refusing to support wholesale price caps on electricity. White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said, ""The president continues to believe that the issue is mostly a California matter, dealing with the legislation that is before the state. And the leaders of California are working to address that in their own right."" Fleischer also said that Bush wanted to focus on a ""long term"" national energy policy. (AAP Newsfeed, 1/23/01; Wall Street Journal, 1/23/01) Texas Energy Company Accused of Price Gouging to Make Money off California's Energy Crisis. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered further inquiry into allegations by California officials that El Paso Natural Gas Co., a Houston based subsidiary of El Paso Energy Co., manipulated the natural gas market by keeping supply artificially low, contributing to the high price of electricity in the state. El Paso Energy was one of the Texas firms ""grandfathered"" by Bush's voluntary emissions standards in Texas. Between 1993 and 1998, El Paso Energy and El Paso Natural Gas PACs gave a total of $8,000 to Bush's gubernatorial campaigns. During the 1999-2000 election cycle, El Paso Energy Corp. and El Paso Natural Gas Co. gave a total of $743,029 to Bush and the GOP -- $460,395 to GOP in soft money, $247,750 to GOP candidates from its PAC, and $34,884 to the Bush campaign from its employees and executives.

LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - British utility Innogy said on Thursday it had started trading wholesale electricity on the French-Italian border and was set to enter the German power market. ""We have done some wholesale trading on the Italy-France border, moving power from France to Italy, and we are very close to doing some in Germany,"" said director of trading Tony West in an interview with Reuters. ""This year we will significantly increase our trading in (mainland) Europe; we are discussing relationships with counterparties at the moment,"" he added. Innogy is building a European power trading team at its headquarters in Swindon, southern England, from where it already trades the UK gas and power markets. FRANCE COULD BE KEY MARKET West said the company initially had expected the main focus of its European trading strategy to be Germany and the north west of the continent. But the early signs were that France would also play a key role, particularly as Innogy had gained access to capacity in the UK-France undersea interconnector cable. ""France has taken me by surprise. It might be more important than we anticipated although there are clearly still issues about the speed of liberalisation,"" said West. A core of about eight companies regularly trade power in France, including TXU Europe, Enron and a trading alliance between Endesa and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, according to traders. West said Innogy had so far concentrated on buying power in France, not always from French companies, and taking it to Italy via the cross border interconnector between the two countries. Innogy had bought some of the 400-megawatts available on the interconnector through recent auctions, he said. ""It's easy to trade through France, the cost of taking power through to the border is minuscule, although buying power in France and then selling it in France is a lot more difficult,"" said West. He said Innogy had signed grid balancing agreements with French transmission grid operator RTE. Andy Duff, managing director of generation and trading, added France could become become important for Innogy on a retail level, as well as a trading level, depending on how effectively the UK-France interconnector could be used. ""The European market will be driven by the operation of interconnectors and transmission services as well as exchanges,"" said Duff. Innogy may look to trade on Germany's two power exchanges as well as that country's burgeoning over-the-counter market. The company is in the process of signing standard trading agreements for Germany based on the terms devised by the industry group the European Federation of Energy Traders (EFET). FOCUS ON TRADING, NOT ASSETS Duff said Innogy's strategy in Europe was to focus on trading but not the acquisition of physical assets. ""We are not going to lead with assets in Europe. We will focus on trading services-type arrangements, extracting value from (other companies') assets. That's the main thrust of the business,"" he said. West said Innogy's trading in mainland Europe would expand into natural gas as opportunities emerged. The company already trades around the UK-Belgium gas interconnector. Mosaic Group posts strong first quarter results 05/03/2001 Canada NewsWire (Copyright Canada NewsWire 2001) -- Diluted Cash Earnings per Share Increases by 29% and Revenues up by 89% -- TORONTO, May 3 /CNW/ - Mosaic Group Inc. (MGX:TSE), Canada's leading outsourced marketing services agency, announced today that it continued its trend of strong earnings growth for the period ending March 31, 2001. Posting its 18th consecutive quarter of year over year revenue growth, Mosaic has also reported an average quarterly organic growth rate of 27% since 1996. Financial highlights from continuing operations(x) for this quarter include: - Revenues at $171.8 million - up 89% or $80.7 million from Q1 2000. ""Mosaic has consistently outpaced the growth of its peers within an industry that is clearly expanding,"" said Mike Preston, Chairman and CEO Mosaic Group Inc. ""We have posted 18 consecutive quarters of continued growth while adding to our blue chip client list. We are building our business by taking our clients' business farther every time we deal with them. Our organic growth comes not only from securing new client wins, but from the cross-selling wins that are characteristic of a mature company able to leverage a robust and diverse range of service offerings."" New Client Wins In the first quarter of 2001, Mosaic's newly acquired business unit Paradigm, has secured new client business worth between $20 million and $25 million a year in revenue. Combined with new client wins from Mosaic's other business units, and increases in spending from some existing clients, Mosaic has made significant progress in closing its new business gap for 2001. New Power --------- During the first quarter of 2001, Paradigm signed a contract with New Power to acquire residential and commercial customers through a variety of direct response channels such as outbound telemarketing, inbound telemarketing, direct mail and ""feet on the street"". New Power was formed by Enron Corp., the largest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas in North America. Paradigm had previously provided contract marketing services to New Power. Through diligent effort, Paradigm was able to expand the contract to include the performance-based customer acquisition component. /For further information: Please Contact: Clint Becker, Chief Financial Officer, Mosaic Group Inc., (416) 813-4275, email: beckerc(at)mosaicgroupinc.com; Donna Cox-Davies, Director of Communications, Mosaic Group Inc., (416) 813-4279, Email: cox-daviesd(at)mosaicgroupinc.com/ 16:10 ET European Phone Companies' Outlook Brightens: Rates of Return 2001-05-03 08:52 (New York) European Phone Companies' Outlook Brightens: Rates of Return London, May 3 (Bloomberg) -- European telephone companies such as British Telecommunications Plc and Deutsche Telekom AG have improved their ability to pay back debt in recent weeks, making their bonds a buy, investors said. ``Sentiment seems to be changing,'' said Anna Lees-Jones, who helps manage about 28 billion pounds ($40 billion) of corporate bonds at M&G Investment Management. ``I've been building up my telecoms position all year.'' British Telecom's 10-year euro-denominated bonds sold in January yield about 214 basis points more than government debt, down from a record 238 in March. Contracts that pay out if the company goes bankrupt have also fallen in the past month, according to Enron Corp., which trades the derivatives. Bond yields and bankruptcy derivatives have also declined for Deutsche Telekom and Royal KPN NV, after the companies said they would sell assets to pay down debt that has pushed their credit ratings to record lows and weighed on their shares. Phone companies sold $100 billion of bonds last year to finance licenses and equipment for new mobile services. British Telecom said yesterday it will sell its stakes in Japan Telecom Co. and Spain's Airtel SA to Vodafone Group for 4.8 billion pounds. British Telecom may also sell as much as 7.5 billion pounds of shares to existing investors in a so-called rights offer, according to Legal & General Group Plc, one of the company's shareholders. Deutsche Telekom will sell assets such as cable television, and a stake in Global One and Wind SpA, Chief Financial Officer Karl-Gerhard Eick said last week. KPN, the biggest Dutch phone company, said on March 26 it plans to raise at least 5 billion euros from asset sales to lower debt. Those plans have helped shift investors' perceptions of the companies' creditworthiness, money managers said. `Drastic Measures' ``At the beginning of the year the market was assuming telecoms companies would be downgraded from single-A to triple- B,'' said Peter Harvey, who helps run about $8.6 billion at F&C Management. ``Drastic measures such as deeply-discounted rights issues led investors to believe they will maintain their single-A status.'' The gap, or spread, between British Telecom's sterling denominated bonds maturing in 2006, and U.K. five-year government bonds has narrowed 50 basis points to 109 basis points in the past month. Spreads between Deutsche Telekom's 6.125 percent five- year euro bonds and German government debt narrowed 35 basis points to 107 in April. Bankruptcy Swaps Fall Those shifts in sentiment are also reflected in Enron's bankruptcy swaps, where prices have fallen in the past month, said Simon Brooks, a trader at Enron. Enron prices the swaps using indexes that measure the probability of bankruptcy and the likely recovery rate in that event. The price is expressed as a percentage above a benchmark interest rate such as the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. British Telecom bankruptcy swaps have declined to 66 basis points from 96 on April 1, Enron said. Bankruptcy swaps on Deutsche Telekom dropped to 78 from 100, while KPN's fell to 135 from 183. Over the same period, France Telecom SA's declined to 70 from 100 and Telecom Italia SpA's fell to 94 from 119. British Telecom's bond yields may fall further relative to government debt, analysts said. They still offer higher yields than those of rival Vodafone Group Plc, which has the same ratings though with a stable outlook. While both companies have five-year euro-denominated bonds, British Telecom's offer 55 basis points more yield. The rivals also both have bonds maturing in 2004, and Vodafone's yield about 23 basis points fewer. ``If BT retains their rating, their spreads should be probably 20 to 30 basis points narrower,'' said Brian Venables, head of credit strategy at WestLB. ``Even though it has performed extremely well this year, there is much greater potential for BT's debt.'' Debt Reduction Target Both Moody's Investors Service, which rates British Telecom ``A2'', and Standard & Poor's, which rates it ``A'', have those ratings on watch for further cuts after trimming them four rungs last year. The company's asset sales to Vodafone are ``definitely positive in terms of the rating assessment,'' said Aidan Fisher, who rates British Telecom for Moody's. In combination with the proceeds of a rights sale, ``that would meet the target they set themselves this year -- that's quite a lot to achieve in a 12 month period.'' British Telecom has said it wants to slash its 30 billion pounds of debt by a third and fend off further rating cuts. Before companies such as British Telecom clarified their debt-reduction plans, ``the world and his wife were underweight'' telecom bonds in March, said Harvey at F&C. The investment firm has since raised its holding of telecom bonds to neutral, from underweight, relative to its benchmark, he said. Bond yields ``were trading very much out of line to the rest of the market,'' said Lees-Jones at M&G. Now, ``they have come in quite a bit and will come in further.'' --Tom Kohn and Alice James in the London newsroom (44-20) 7330 7929 or at tkohn@bloomberg.net, with reporting by Christine Harper /zls Story illustration: {CRED <GO>} to see credit analysis on Bloomberg. {BRITEL <Corp> <GO>} for BT's bonds. {DT <Corp> <GO>} for Deutsche Telekom's bonds. UK:Corporates warm to charms of credit derivatives By Tom Bergin 05/03/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - European corporates are beginning to turn to credit derivatives, among the more esoteric and complex of financial instruments, to hedge the risk their debtors won't pay up, market participants said on Thursday. Credit derivatives are insurance-like tools that allow users to hedge the risk of default on a debt. They are mainly used by banks, hedge funds and insurance companies to hedge or gain exposure to the risk of a bond issuer defaulting. Dealers said an environment of deteriorating credit quality and a growing awareness among corporates that credit derivatives offer certain advantages over established hedging tools was behind the increasing use of the instruments. The market remains small, with only around a dozen non-financial European corporates regularly using credit derivatives to manage their credit portfolio at present. But market professionals predict they will one day become as commonplace in the corporate world as other hedging tools such as interest rate swaps and currency options. ""We see (corporate use) as a big growth area for credit derivatives, maybe the biggest,"" says Bryan Seyfried, vice-president of Enron Credit in London. Enron Credit grew out of the efforts of energy company Enron Corp. to hedge its own credit risk portfolio and now specialises in marketing credit risk management solutions to other non-financial corporates. Ralf Lierow, director of credit derivatives at Siemens Financial Services in Munich, said the ability to buy and sell in a liquid market means credit derivatives offer a flexibility that established tools like credit insurance and forfaiting guarantees lack. Credit derivatives were are often cheaper than the alternatives, too, he added. ""This is not a trading book thing. For us, the credit default swap is another tool for credit risk management,"" Lierow said. HELPS OPERATIONAL UNITS DO MORE BUSINESS Siemens Financial Services acts as the centralised risk portfolio management operation for companies within the Siemens electronics and industrial group. It first started using credit derivatives in July 2000. Large companies like Siemens can have hundreds of millions of dollars in receivables on their books at any time. The efficiency with which these companies manage the credit risk on their receivables has an impact on their day to day business. ""The advantage for the operative area is that they can offload more receivables and do more business,"" Lierow said. Siemens uses credit default swaps, the most liquid type of credit derivatives, to hedge its portfolio of debtors on a constant basis. As the balance of cash owed by each name fluctuates over time, the company tries to match this with default swap positions. Hence, if a customer fails to pay, Siemens can recoup the debt from the default swap seller. Other companies use credit derivatives less frequently. ""There are occasional corporate users that have secured one-off requirements for balance-sheet management aims or to strip out the credit risk of a commercial transaction,"" said Walter Gontarek, head of global credit products at RBC Dominion Securities. By hedging a country or company risk which a corporate may not be comfortable in carrying, a credit derivative can facilitate a project that may otherwise be unfeasible, dealers said. NOT PUT OFF BY BAD PRESS Corporates' adoption of credit derivatives is in spite of the negative publicity the instruments have received in recent years. A number of disputes over whether protection buyers could force banks to pay up on contracts have ended up in court. However, traders insist that subsequent work done on contract documentation minimises the risk of such disputes in future. Nonetheless a very practical concern for corporates remains, in that credit derivatives documentation was designed by bankers with sovereign and corporate bonds in mind. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) standard documentation for credit default swaps allows for a pay-out in relation to defaults on bond payments but not on a private debtor's failure to pay. ""We use the ISDA framework but we need it redrafted in specific ways to fit our needs. You cannot take a standard contract and trade on it if you want to hedge trade receivables,"" Lierow said. These amendments add to the cost of the credit derivative. Another problem that corporates face is the complexity of credit derivatives. There is little experience of the instruments, which are barely a decade old, in the corporate world. Siemens had to get its expertise from the financial markets, hiring Lierow from Bankgesellschaft Berlin. Clive Banks, UK head of derivatives sales to buy-side clients at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, said much of the effort in marketing credit derivatives to corporates involves educating them about the products and the risks involved. ""It's about explaining credit risk management and what kind of volatility and cost having credit risk introduces,"" he said. OUTLOOK PROMISING Yet some corporates are beginning to take full advantage of their new tool. Lierow said that Siemens, which currently only buys credit protection, planned to start acting as a default swaps seller in the coming months. He said selling would facilitate better matching of protection levels to actual exposures, and would enable diversification of risk away from industry sectors where the company's activities are concentrated. ""You could improve the portfolio mix by buying protection on automotives and selling protection on pharmaceuticals,"" he said. Allegheny Energy buys three power plants 05/03/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. HAGERSTOWN, Md. (AP) - Allegheny Energy Inc. said Thursday it has purchased three power plants from Houston-based Enron Corp. The company said it issued more than 14 million shares of common stock worth $667 million to pay for the transaction. The plants are in Tennessee, Indiana and Illinois. The Midwestern purchase will bring an additional 1,710 megawatts on line. The company is expected to own 14,000 megawatts of generating power by 2005. Allegheny also has plans to build natural gas-fired facilities in Arizona, Indiana and Pennsylvania. Allegheny Energy is the parent of Allegheny Power, which supplies electricity and natural gas to 3 million people in Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. Allegheny Energy Buys Midwest Capacity From Enron Unit 05/03/2001 Dow Jones News Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) HAGRSTOWN, Md. -(Dow Jones)- Allegheny Energy Inc.'s (AYE) Allegheny Energy Supply Co. unit purchased 1,710 megawatts of natural gas-fired merchant generating capacity in three Midwest states from Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Enron North America unit. Financial terms weren't disclosed. In a press release Thursday, Allegheny said it financed the acquisition through debt and equity and expects the purchase to add to earnings in 2001, excluding transaction costs. Allegheny noted that this latest acquisition gives Allegheny Energy Supply more than 14,000 MW of total generating capacity that it will own or control by 2005. Allegheny Energy Global Markets will market output from the three facilities. On April 27, Allegheny priced its public offering of 12.4 million shares at $48.25 each, and said it would use the $598.3 million in gross proceeds to fund its previously reported acquisition of generating facilities located in the Midwest and for other corporate purposes. New York Stock Exchange-listed shares of Allegheny recently traded at $49.85, down 51 cents, or 1%, on composite volume of 306,000 shares. Average daily volume is 538,773 shares. Allegheny, which posted an operating net of $313.7 million, or $2.84 a share, on revenue of $4.01 billion for the year ended Dec. 31, is an energy company.

Chow; Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5400 Allegheny Energy Supply Completes Purchase of Midwest Assets; Adds 1,700 MW to Growing Generation Fleet 05/03/2001 Business Wire (Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire) HAGERSTOWN, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 3, 2001--Allegheny Energy, Inc. (NYSE: AYE) today announced that its unregulated generation subsidiary, Allegheny Energy Supply Company, LLC, has completed the purchase of 1,710 megawatts of natural gas-fired merchant generating capacity in three Midwest states from Enron North America, a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE). The acquisition gives Allegheny Energy more than 14,000 MW of total generating capacity that it will own or control by 2005 and marks a significant step in the Company's strategic course toward becoming a national energy supplier. Earlier this year, Allegheny Energy Supply acquired 83 MW of coal-fired generation in the Conemaugh Generating Facility near Johnstown, Pa. Additionally, the Company has announced plans to build a 1,080-MW natural gas combined-cycle plant in La Paz County, Ariz.; a 630-MW natural gas combined-cycle facility near South Bend, Ind.; and a 540-MW natural gas fired combined-cycle generating facility in Springdale, Pa. Another 220 MW of peaking capacity have already been completed in Pennsylvania. The Midwest acquisition was financed through a combination of debt and equity and will be accretive to Allegheny Energy's earnings in 2001, excluding transaction costs and other costs related to the integration. Yesterday, the Company issued more than 14 million shares of common stock to facilitate the transaction. Alan J. Noia, Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Allegheny Energy, said, ""I am pleased to announce the closing of Allegheny Energy's largest generation acquisition to date. It provides our Company with significant generation presence and capability as an energy merchant to sell electricity from efficient natural gas-fired generation facilities in more areas of the country with a growing demand for energy."" Output from the three facilities will be marketed by Allegheny Energy Global Markets. ""These premium generating assets are designed for operation in times of peak electricity demand,"" said Noia. ""Because of its national presence, Allegheny Energy Global Markets will be able to market the output from these newly acquired facilities in a wide variety of ways with our portfolio of existing assets and other supply arrangements so that overall operational efficiency and shareholder value is maximized."" Allegheny Energy Supply's newly acquired facilities include: the Gleason, Tenn., plant (546 MW), approximately 40 miles north of Jackson, Tenn.; the Wheatland, Ind., plant (508 MW), approximately 70 miles northeast of Evansville, Ind.; and the Lincoln Energy Center plant (656 MW) in Manhattan, Ill., near Chicago. These assets give Allegheny Energy Supply additional generating capacity within the East Central Area Reliability region (ECAR) and initial generation sources in the Mid-America Interconnected Network (MAIN) and the Southeastern Electric Reliability Council (SERC). Salomon Smith Barney acted as financial advisor and Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue acted as legal counsel for Allegheny Energy for the acquisition.

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Salomon Smith Barney's utility analysts sharply cut their forecast of the profitability of generating electricity in the U.S. in 2002 and beyond because power prices are expected to drop more sharply than natural gas prices starting next year. The analysts cut the profit margin in natural gas-fired power in 2003 to $3.98 a megawatt-hour from $8.73/MWh, a 54% difference from their last forecast in February. They lowered their power price index for 2002 by 1.5% and for 2003 by 7.1% Thursday in a published report. Their forecast is based on forward markets for electricity and gas. ""Gas prices are remaining strong for a much longer period of time, while power prices drop off,"" senior electricity industry analyst Raymond Niles said in a telephone conference with investors. As a result, stock prices for power producers such as AES Corp. (AES), Mirant (MIR), Calpine Corp. (CPN) and NRG Energy (NRG) could peak this summer in advance of strong third quarter earnings reports, the Salomon report says. ""Investors may still shy away from asset and investment-heavy power producers if realized prices begin to reflect the decreases in power prices now projected in the forward curve,"" the report warns. After this summer, the stocks of energy companies that focus more on trading will regain momentum, Salomon expects. These ""energy merchant"" companies, such as Enron Corp. (ENE), Williams Cos. (WMB), Duke Energy (DUK) and Dynegy (DYN), should be able to take advantage of higher trading volume and greater volatility in power markets in non-summer months, according to Salomon. ""We expect (annual trading) volumes to grow, industry-wide, between 25% and 40%, on average, during 2001-03, as the $800 billion global energy commodity market continues to open,"" the report predicts. The overall electricity price trend is national, according to Salomon. The report, titled ""Power Curve,"" expects 2001 wholesale power prices to exceed last year's by 131% in the West and by 34% on average in the eastern U.S., including Texas. But since their last forecast, the analysts lowered their forward price curve for next year and beyond in 10 of 11 regional power pools. ""Interestingly, the exception to that is the New York Power Pool,"" Niles told investors. For the remainder of this year, however, Salomon still expects power producers to beat substantially last year's breakthrough results. ""About 50% of the spike upward in western U.S. power prices the past six months has been from something we've never seen before in this industry: political and credit risk,"" Niles said in the conference. Western merchant power suppliers are benefitting from the ""unholy mess in California,"" Niles said, but that won't last forever. ""Whenever the debate tapers off and we have a resolution in sight, that premium will slowly drain out of the western markets, and bring down profitability for the group,"" Niles said. National calls for reregulation due to the California crisis could continue to hurt stock prices for the entire sector, even though reregulation won't happen. Further, in so far as such calls discourage investment in generating plants, transmission lines and gas pipelines, they could also extend the current period of extremely high earnings, according to the report. In non-western states, the greatest profitability from power generation for the next two years is seen in New England. -By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.com Fitch Affs Northern Border; Rtg Outlook To Stable From Negative 05/03/2001 Business Wire (Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire) NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 3, 2001--Fitch has affirmed its `BBB+' senior debt rating for Northern Border Partners, L.P. (NBP) and its `A-` senior debt rating for its regulated pipeline affiliate Northern Border Pipeline Co. (NBPL). The Rating Outlook for both companies is changed to Stable from Negative. The rating action was taken after a review of NBP's recent acquisitions and long-term business plan. A combination of debt and equity at NBP was used to fund the recent acquisitions of Bear Paw, LLC, Midwestern Gas Transmission Company, and Dynegy Canada midstream assets. An additional $125-150 million of equity is expected to be sold in the coming months to pay down short-term debt and complete the permanent financing. The improvement in Rating Outlook primarily reflects NBP's demonstrated commitment to undertake conservative long-term financing and operating strategies. Future acquisitions at the partnership level are expected to be financed 50/50, debt/equity so as to maintain financial flexibility and a stable credit profile. Moreover, management has shown a strong bias to minimize commodity price risk as it expands its non-regulated gas operations. For example, processing contracts for Bear Paw's four processing facilities are contracted for on a percentage of proceeds basis and liquids prices have been 90% hedged by NBP through 2001, limiting downside exposure. NBPL continues to exhibit strong competitive market, operating, and financial characteristics that are consistent with its current `A-` rating. The company is a low-cost transporter of Canadian gas into the Midwest, with costs per hundred miles of less than 4 cents per mcf. The December 2000 completion of the Alliance Pipeline has had minimal impact on Northern Border as capacity utilization approaches 100%. Pipeline capacity is 99% subscribed through mid-September 2003. Its shippers are financially strong customers with uniform take-or-pay contracts. The company has never written off a bad debt. NBPL should generate EBITDA/interest coverage of nearly 4.0 times over the next few years. Credit concerns primarily relate to NBP's changing business mix and the expectation of increased market risk associated with its growing midstream operations as compared with the stable, low-risk profile of NBPL. While projected consolidated and stand alone credit measures at NBP remain relatively strong, there will be less predictability in the future cash stream utilized to service debt. NBP is a publicly traded master limited partnership. Its primary holding is a 70% economic interest in NBPL, a 1,214-mile FERC regulated interstate pipeline transporting natural gas from the Canadian border to the upper Midwest. Enron Corp. and The Williams Companies, Inc. hold a 10.0% and 3.3% stake in NBP, respectively, with the remainder publicly held. Enron controls an 82.5% stake in the management committee of NBP with Williams holding the remaining management allocation.

NEW DELHI, May 3 (Reuters) - The Indian unit of Enron Corp said on Thursday that its officials would meet members of a government panel formed to re-negotiate a troubled $2.9 billion power project in western India. But the willingness to meet the panel next week should not be construed as an offer to renegotiate the contract, Dabhol Power Company (DPC) said in a statement. ""As a matter of courtesy we have agreed to meet with them next week,"" the DPC statement said. ""Since the purpose of our meeting is to hear out the committee and understand their thoughts, we will not present any proposal."" DPC said it had constantly maintained that it was open to maintaining a dialogue towards resolving issues. ""(But) This meeting should in no manner be construed as an open offer from DPC to renegotiate the terms of the contract,"" it added. DPC and the government of the western state of Maharashtra have been locked in a payment battle for months, with the state's electricity board balking at paying Enron what it considers too high a rate for electricity. At present, Maharashtra's State Electricity Board (MSEB) owes the DPC, of which Enron is a 65 percent stakeholder, some $48 million for power. The Maharashtra government last week announced the formation of a panel of experts to re-negotiate its contract with DPC and lower the cost of power sold to MSEB. LARGEST FOREIGN INVESTMENT The Dabhol project, the single largest foreign investment in India, consists of two phases, the already-built 740 megawatt power plant and a 1,444 MW plant that is expected to be finished this year. Last week, Dabhol's board authorised the plant's managing director to issue a preliminary notice of termination of service to MSEB. The notice, which has not been issued, would be the first step for Enron to pull out of the project. Earlier, a source familiar with the project told Reuters that Indian lenders, who have provided millions of dollars to Houston-based Enron to build DPC are lobbying with the government to act quickly and end the crisis. ""We have asked the government for help. We are awaiting their reply,"" the source, who is employed with a large financial institution, said. The domestic lenders to the project are Industrial Development Bank of India , ICICI Ltd , Industrial Finance Corporation of India , Canara Bank and State Bank of India . If Enron pulls out of the project, the source said, the lenders would have no choice but to seek an alternative buyer. ""The plant is good, Maharashtra needs power and I am sure buyers can be found,"" the source added. India State Panel's Sat Meet With Enron Unit Postponed 05/03/2001 Dow Jones International News (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India's Maharashtra state government's expert committee's Saturday meeting with the U.S. energy major Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Indian unit Dabhol Power Co. has been postponed until May 11 at the request of DPC, a committee member told Dow Jones Newswires late Thursday. The nine-member committee has been appointed to renegotiate the Maharashtra State Electricity Board's controversial power purchase agreement with DPC. The state government has asked the committee to try to negotiate a revised agreement within a month. ""The negotiating committee's first meeting with the Dabhol Power Co. management scheduled for Saturday has been postponed until May 11, 0530 GMT, at DPC's request. They (DPC) told us they wanted some more time to prepare themselves for the meeting and we have granted their request,"" said a committee member. The committee's goals are to lower the power tariff and allow the sale of excess power to the federal government or its utilities. A restructure of the DPC's stakeholding may also be on the agenda. -By Himendra Kumar, Dow Jones Newswires; 91-11-461-9427; himendra.kumar@dowjones.com EnergieKontor Secures Enron Deal For Spain, Germany Projs 05/03/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- After more than a year of lagging earnings, investment missteps and unexpected disasters, U.K. vertically-integrated utility Scottish Power (SPI) is hoping a new strategy to streamline its businesses will signal a more focused period for the company. But it's got its work cut out. While investors were cheered by news that its U.S. Utah-based Hunter power plant is back online after a six-month outage that cost the company an estimated $160 million, uncertainty over its plans for its Southern Water unit and apparent ongoing commitment to loss-making telecoms venture Thus are seen as muddling group focus. ""It all adds up - the lack of coherent strategy, quite substantial downgrades and a whole host of non-core businesses that they don't have any natural management flair or expertise in,"" said Brian Gallagher, a senior fund manager at London-based Gartmore Investment Management, which has GBP3 million of Scottish Power shares in its Global Utilities Fund. ""We have a reasonably low opinion of the company."" The company said Thursday that its pretax profit before goodwill amortization and exceptional items for the fiscal year ending March 31 fell to GBP628 million from GBP736 million a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share declined to 30.65 pence in the 2001 fiscal year from 41.22 pence in 2000. The company acknowledged profits have been hit hard by the Hunter outage, competition on wholesale and retail markets in the U.K. and strict price controls on its regulated infrastructure businesses. Although the company's shares were trading at 458.5 pence after the release of Thursday's earnings results, up from 441.5 pence Wednesday, they are down more than 15% from 533 pence a year ago. Executives say they are restructuring the business into three targeted divisions to capitalize on its traditional strengths in generation and power supply and infrastructure and to expand its overseas activities. ""We've now got a trading and commercial link between generation and supply and the first thing we are doing is putting emphasis on that...on growing earnings across that value chain,"" Scottish Power Chief Executive Ian Russell told journalists in a conference call Thursday. ""In the U.S., we are focused on cost cutting and on acquiring new businesses."" Scottish Power's move away from a full multi-utility profile - begun last year with its partial disposal of Thus and its withdrawal from an Internet banking venture with the Royal Bank of Scotland - toward a more narrowly focused energy business mimics a trend across the industry toward greater specialization. The company is also considering selling Southern Water, which would allow it to focus even more closely on its power business. Yet analysts and investors say they are looking for more details of the company's overall growth strategy from Russell, who took over as chief executive last month, and other managers. The toll from months of drift, is evident, they said. Sales Of Southern Water, Thus Seen Indeed, despite its efforts to chart a new road, Scottish Power appears to be reluctant to acknowledge the failure of some of its non-core ventures. Russell said his company remains ""supportive"" of Thus, which reported a 2000 fiscal year loss of GBP21.4 million this week, and has no plans to exit its remaining 50% stake in the company. Similarly, he said, Scottish Power hasn't yet made a final decision to dispose of Southern Water - which has cut costs under its Scottish parent but is increasingly unable to cover its capital expenditure - although he said the company had received ""a number of offers"" from potential buyers. Although he declined to identify any of the bidders, Italian energy company Enel SpA (ENI) has confirmed its interest. Industry sources said a prompt sale of the water unit looks likely, with some bids already exceeding the GBP2 billion at which many analysts value the company's combined assets and debt. It's unclear, they said, how Southern Water or Thus would fit into Scottish Power's new image. ""Scottish Power sees itself as an international energy company,"" a source familiar with the company said. In a year's time, he added, ""it would be unlikely that Southern Water and Thus would be part of the company."" Revenues from the sale of the water unit would also help Scottish Power pursue its U.S. expansion without adding to its 90% gearing levels, analysts and investors said. Russell declined to comment on reports Scottish Power is considering buying Enron Corp.'s Oregon-based unit, Portland General, but admitted the company would be a logical geographical fit with Pacificorp. Analysts said Scottish Power's plans for U.S. growth is likely to be a key part of its energy strategy. ""We like their U.S. strategy where they've leveraged expertise gained in the highly competitive U.K. market,"" said Gareth Lewis-Davies, head of utilities research at Lehman Brothers in London. Closer to home, competition and the trend toward increased specialization in the power industry may force Scottish Power to determine whether its business strength lies in asset management or retail and generation. ""Strategic decisions need to be made, and I'm not sure if they are going to make them in the near term or not,"" said Andrew Wright, U.K. utilities analyst at UBS Warburg in London. ""They are pretty much involved across the value chain, and I think it remains to be seen which part of the value chain they specialize in, if any.""

Subject: Thursday Meeting on Winter Gas Prices

Ken:

I have invited the following individuals to join us at the 3 pm Thursday 
meeting to review the draft of your Columbus speech on the natural gas 
situation.

Hamd Alhkayat--Hamd has replaced Andrew Miles in the rotation and will be 
helping me with your presentations as well as being the lead with Jeff's 
speeches.

Shelley Corman--Shelley has been developing messages for the current and 
anticipated gas situation and pipeline safety for the gas pipeline group.  
(The safety issue could come up in your Q&A.)

Stinson Gibner--Stinson is with the research group that has generated some of 
the more complex slides in your draft dealing with volatility and historic 
futures pricing.

Gil Muhl--Gil markets gas products to customers and is speaking at an AGA 
conference on the gas supply and price situation the day before your talk.  
His group is focusing on new products to help end-users with winter 
volatility.  I have asked Gil to send you his presentation as well for the 
meeting.

Back to your presentation (the draft slides of which I am delivering to you 
today), Dan Yergin thought it would be appropriate for you to give an 
overview of the situation as the ""teacher"" or ""professor.""  Some questions 
that you could address would include:

Where has the industry come from, and what lessons have we learned?

How is the business different today?

What public policy conclusions are implicit in this history?

I think our comparative advantage over the specialists who will be presenting 
before and after your keynote is that you have ""been there"" in the evolution 
of the natural gas market, and Enron is at the forefront of helping customers 
deal with price and supply uncertainty.  There is also a good opportunity to 
stress the need for new industry ""best practices"" (more hedging) and the 
right public policies to deal with this issue (from ""do no harm"" to expanding 
incentives in the market).

- Rob

As you may be aware, the Chief Judge informed the parties to the settlement proceeding this afternoon that he intends to recommend to the Commission that it employ the June 19 rate methodology for the refund period from October 2 forward.

Attached are draft comments that Sarah Novosel and I propose to submit to the Judge and his legal staff tomorrow.  While we would like to convince the Judge that the June 19 methodology is not appropriate, we also provide a fallback approach.

Please review the comments (they are only 4 pages) and send your comments to us.  We plan to submit the comments tomorrow.

Thanks

Ray and Sarah

help is on the way.  We are going to establish some senior executive 
oversight as well as an executive director (probably someone who came through 
the program).  Charlene is going to be moving into a commercial role (which 
was the original plan when she was brought into the organization).  I'd be 
happy to talk to you in more detail when I get back to Houston.

Hi guys.  

I wanted to let you know that I am extremely concerned about the 
Associate/Analyst program, so much so that I feel all the work I have done, 
and all the time I have spent on the program has had little impact outside 
Wharton/Penn recruiting.  In fact we won't get more than 1 associate from 
Wharton this year for a variety of internal and external reasons.  This 
program has brought incredible talent into the organization, but we have lost 
a lot of momentum over the last two years.

In as much as I would like to continue to support the program, I can't  in 
its current form, and don't have time to fix what I thought we had been 
addressing.  The entire program is disfunctional, and the commercial teams 
are not lending support to the program.  I'd be very happy to spend a few 
minutes of your time (rather than blather on in an email) to give you both my 
overview of the program, and suggest changes and improvements.  

You know you have my support, but the current state of affairs down there has 
gotten me to my rope's end with the program.

Subject: DRAFT response to Greenpeace Kyoto letter

Attached is a first draft of a response to Greenpeace's April 5 letter to 
Jeff Skilling asking for Enron's answers to some specific questions on the 
Kyoto Protocol and climate change.   Similar letters were delivered by 
Greenpeace Europe in native languages to Enron's offices in the UK, 
Netherlands, Spain, and Belgium.

I have attached a copy of one of the letters below.  All the questions are 
the same in each.

I have drafted a response with the goals of:

1)  Being responsive to Greenpeace without being defensive or without 
""greenwashing.""   We have an already-published public ""statement"" on climate 
change and a very positive, solution-oriented story to tell, with many facts 
and accomplishments to back up our statements.   I think our letter can land 
in the stack that they consider ""positive"" responses, and not in the stack of 
non-responses or ""we don't care"" responses.

2)  Steering away from directly answering the no-win questions about ""Kyoto."" 
  I think we can respond to the letter in a way that provides meaningful 
answers to the general themes of the letter.   I have discussed this with 
many of you already, but I strongly feel that we should not get dragged down 
into debates over what we like/dislike, support/oppose about Kyoto....we'll 
quickly get into questions we can't now answer, and may never be able to 
answer.   I'd prefer it if we rise above the politics of the issue and look 
solution-oriented by saying counties and companies should continue to be 
engaged in this important issue.

3)  Developing corporate-wide messages that we can use in multiple 
applications -- arming our PR and govt. affairs advocates with a tight script 
to use in their efforts; responding to shareholder inquiries and annual 
meeting Q&A;  Ken Lay or other executive speeches and presentations; 
something for our Corporate Responsibility annual report.  

Sorry for the long preamble, but climate change has become a very sensitive 
issue of late, and our message/strategy needs to be very coordinated and we 
need to have one clear set of statements that everyone in the company can 
understand and use.  With that said, I also believe that these messages 
should be used very carefully, as the subject matter is complex and straying 
too far from the basics can be dangerous.  We should designate one or two 
clear spokespeople that can answer any follow up to the Greenpeace letter by 
press or policymakers, and really stick to the boundaries of what's in our 
response letter.

There is also the issue of customizing responses from the European offices, 
using this letter as a template and adding a few examples of Enron good deeds 
in the local areas.   I am not opposed to doing so, but would again 
appreciate being able to review these responses before they go.  Please let 
me know if you have other views.

I would like to send our response by early next week, maybe even Monday 4/23 
if we can turn it around that fast.  Thank you for your input and assistance 
and I look forward to your reply.

Jeff

Sorry for the long preamble, but climate change has become a very sensitive issue of late, and our message/strategy needs to be very coordinated and we need to have one clear set of statements that everyone in the company can understand and use. With that said, I also believe that these messages should be used very carefully, as the subject matter is complex and straying too far from the basics can be dangerous. We should designate one or two clear spokespeople that can answer any follow up to the Greenpeace letter by press or policymakers, and really stick to the boundaries of what's in our response letter. There is also the issue of customizing responses from the European offices, using this letter as a template and adding a few examples of Enron good deeds in the local areas. I am not opposed to doing so, but would again appreciate being able to review these responses before they go. Please let me know if you have other views. I would like to send our response by early next week, maybe even Monday 4/23 if we can turn it around that fast. Thank you for your input and assistance and I look forward to your reply.

Mediator talked of a bigger refund: He reportedly suggested a $4.5 billion=
=20
deal midway through the failed talks.
By David Whitney
Bee Washington Bureau
(Published July 11, 2001)=20
WASHINGTON -- Midway through the negotiations between California and power=
=20
sellers to settle the myriad issues arising out of the state's energy crisi=
s,=20
the mediator told California's negotiating team that he thought a deal wort=
h=20
more than $4.5 billion would be appropriate -- a much higher figure than he=
=20
suggested after the talks ended Monday.=20
Whether the statement by Curtis Wagner, the chief administrative law judge=
=20
for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, was a negotiating ploy or a=
=20
reflection of his evolving beliefs is not clear.=20
Before the settlement talks began two weeks earlier, Wagner said he thought=
=20
Gov. Gray Davis' demand for $8.9 billion in refunds was too high and that a=
=20
settlement probably would be in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion.=20
The disclosure that Wagner had contemplated a much higher figure midway=20
through the negotiations suggests the state had more support than the judge=
=20
let on Monday when he said after the talks foundered that he thought a deal=
=20
should involve ""hundreds of millions, maybe a billion"" dollars.=20
While the state wants $8.9 billion, $3 billion of that was for overcharges=
=20
during the five months preceding last October and are beyond FERC's scope o=
f=20
review. Even as a starting point then, the $4.5 billion mentioned by Wagner=
=20
represented 75 percent of the money the state was demanding for alleged pri=
ce=20
gouging between October and May.=20
The judge's $4.5 billion figure, divided between cash payments and savings=
=20
from long-term power contracts, was confirmed by three sources who asked to=
=20
be identified only as ""close to the negotiations"" because participants had=
=20
been required to sign confidentiality statements.=20
The sources gave virtually identical accounts of a July 2 meeting with Wagn=
er=20
in which the judge also dismissed as ""inadequate"" a $670 million settlement=
=20
offer made by power generators and marketers.=20
By Monday, the settlement offer had risen to $716 million. But the state=20
refused to back off its $8.9 billion demand, and there never was any seriou=
s=20
back-and-forth negotiations during the 15-day period the regulatory=20
commission had given Wagner to craft a deal.=20
As a consequence of the failed talks, Wagner said Monday that within a week=
=20
he will send the five-member commission his recommendations on how it might=
=20
approach an order refunding power overcharges.=20
Among Wagner's suggestions is that the commission convene a hearing before =
a=20
different administrative judge to take testimony from generators, marketers=
=20
and the state on how to arrive at a fair settlement.=20
The options sketchily outlined by Wagner on Monday included limiting the ti=
me=20
when refunds are allowed -- something that could reduce state claims by abo=
ut=20
one-third -- and changing the way power plant costs are calculated to a=20
formula more favored by generators.=20
It is not clear whether Wagner, who moved from one negotiating team to=20
another during his two-week quest for a deal, ever raised the $4.5 billion=
=20
settlement figure to the power marketers and generators.=20
Joel Newton, who represented Dynegy Power, Duke Energy, Reliant Energy,=20
Williams-AES and Mirant in the talks, said Tuesday he was bound by the=20
confidentiality pledge to keep silent on the internal negotiations.=20
Wagner also is refusing all media calls.=20
According to the account of the negotiations confirmed by sources Tuesday,=
=20
Wagner was angry at the snail's pace of progress after the first week of th=
e=20
talks.=20
On Friday, June 29, Wagner called everyone into his hearing room and scolde=
d=20
them. He condemned the California team, saying they all ought to wear ""clow=
n=20
suits"" because they were ""in the pocket"" of Davis and refused to show any=
=20
independence.=20
He then turned to the generators and said that after a week of talks, nothi=
ng=20
had been heard from them. He told them he wanted them to produce ""real=20
numbers, and hard numbers"" over the weekend and that if they didn't, he wou=
ld=20
-- ""and you're not going to like it.""=20
Wagner's admonition apparently moved no one toward a deal. On Monday, in th=
e=20
meeting with the California delegation, one source quoted Wagner as saying=
=20
the settlement number he received from the generators and marketers ""is so=
=20
low I can't even present it to you.""=20
""I'm not happy with the figures, they're not adequate,"" others quoted the=
=20
judge as saying.=20
At that point, the sources said, Wagner said he was thinking of a settlemen=
t=20
of $2.5 billion in cash, $2 billion in long-term contract savings and other=
=20
money from out-of-state investor-owned utilities and even the federal=20
Bonneville Power Administration, which markets power from dams in the=20
Northwest.=20
But as the clock wound down on the negotiations, nothing much happened unti=
l=20
Friday and Saturday, when the California team met with the five largest pow=
er=20
generators.=20
It was at those meetings that the generators offered $510 million in refund=
s=20
to settle their disputes with the state. But the money would have gone to=
=20
reduce the tab for what they were owed by the state and California utilitie=

and it was loaded with conditions, including the state dropping all of its=

Dan Walters: Davis plays in a virtual world while the energy reality contin=
ues


(Published July 11, 2001)=20
California still has a very real and very severe energy crisis, to wit:=20
The state is still running up massive debts as it pays more for power than =
it=20
can recover from ratepayers and is having trouble borrowing billions of=20
dollars to cover the debt.=20
There is a strong possibility, perhaps a probability, that when summer's he=
at=20
truly descends, there will be severe power blackouts as air conditioners=20
demand more juice than California can generate or buy.=20
One major utility, Pacific Gas and Electric, has filed for bankruptcy=20
protection and a second, Southern California Edison, is on the brink of=20
joining it.=20
There is, however, a virtual energy crisis consisting of political spin,=20
media leaks and made-for-television buzz words -- and it is rapidly becomin=
g=20
dominant, while the real situation fades into the background.=20
This week's comic opera proceedings before a Federal Energy Regulatory=20
Commission administrative judge in Washington had little to do with reality=
=20
and everything to do with the virtual version.=20
Gov. Gray Davis and other officials demanded $8.9 billion in refunds from t=
he=20
generators and brokers who have been selling California power for the past=
=20
year, alleging that California is, in Davis' words, ""being gouged and rippe=
d=20
off."" But the number itself was more or less plucked out of thin air -- an=
=20
arithmetic exercise by the state power grid's traffic controller not intend=
ed=20
for a refund proceeding. And while Judge Curtis Wagner saw it as unrealisti=
c,=20
Davis and other state officials insisted on its validity.=20
""There are refunds due that total hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe=
 a=20
billion dollars,"" Wagner said as a final negotiating session collapsed. But=
=20
that's a far cry from the $8.9 billion that Davis insists is due. ""If you=
=20
think California is going to settle for $1 billion in refunds, we will see=
=20
you in court,"" Davis said Tuesday.=20
Why is Davis being so belligerent? Because it's good politics. Ever since h=
e=20
began berating out-of-state generators and accusing them of ripping off=20
California, Davis' approval ratings have been climbing. If he settled for=
=20
substantially less -- the power generators probably would agree to a couple=
=20
of billion dollars to rid themselves of the matter -- Davis would be=20
embarrassed. Politically, he's served by continuing to portray himself as=
=20
fighting for California and against the out-of-state generators.=20
That it's more political construct than reality is indicated by another eve=
nt=20
this week, Davis' release of state power purchase data from early in the ye=
ar=20
-- numbers that were made public only because a judge told him he had to do=
=20
it.=20
Davis and his minions have been accusing Texas-based generators and power=
=20
brokers of particularly egregious price gouging -- clearly playing on=20
Californians' instinctive mistrust of anything Texan and implying that Texa=
n=20
George W. Bush is a co-conspirator. But the power purchase records -- which=
=20
were released only to journalists willing to pay a stiff fee -- indicate th=
at=20
less than 10 percent of California's power purchase dollars were going to=
=20
Texas and the private sellers, in general, charged the state less than such=
=20
publicly owned utilities as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.=
=20
The clearly adverse position being taken by FERC and the purchase data that=
=20
undercut his jingoistic sloganeering are not, however, deterring Davis from=
=20
continuing to operate, at least for public consumption, in the melodramatic=
=20
virtual world.=20
One cannot, however, ignore reality forever. The likelihood of a=20
pro-generator decision from FERC means that there will be no easy out for=
=20
Davis, or for his pending deal to prevent Southern California Edison from=
=20
slipping into bankruptcy court. The Legislature has refused to act on the=
=20
Edison rescue plan while it awaited an indication of whether the utility's=
=20
debts would be slimmed down by FERC.=20
This week's farcical events make it more likely that the Edison deal will=
=20
stall out permanently in the Legislature and its creditors will force the=
=20
utility into bankruptcy court later this summer. That's part of that nasty=
=20
old reality that cannot simply be wished away.=20

Judge Bars Ratepayers Panel From PG&E Case
Power: Customers are not creditors in the utility's bankruptcy, ruling says=
.=20
Action does not preclude refunds for consumers.
TIM REITERMAN
TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 11 2001

SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge Tuesday reaffirmed his decision to bar a=
=20
ratepayers committee from Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s bankruptcy case and=
=20
denounced the committee's attorney for suggesting that the action could=20
prevent PG&E customers from receiving refunds for excessive energy charges.

Judge Dennis Montali ruled against a U.S. trustee and the ratepayers=20
committee in deciding that ratepayers as a group had no claims and were not=
=20
creditors when PG&E filed for bankruptcy on April 6.

But Montali criticized ""misguided remarks"" by a committee attorney on July =
5=20
and news media accounts that followed the hearing. The judge said the repor=
ts=20
left the misconception that by disallowing a ratepayers committee, he would=
=20
reject all claims of ratepayers and they could lose out on future refunds.

The judge and PG&E officials emphasized that there are no matters involving=
=20
PG&E customer refunds before the state Public Utilities Commission.

State officials are seeking about $9 billion in refunds, however, from the=
=20
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for alleged overcharges to Californian=
s=20
by energy companies since last year.

The distribution of any ratepayer refunds would be decided by the PUC, and=
=20
customers would be paid whether or not they filed Bankruptcy Court claims b=
y=20
a Sept. 5 deadline, the judge and PG&E attorneys said.

The judge took the highly unusual step of directing PG&E and U.S. Trustee=
=20
Linda Ekstrom Stanley to consider remedies to allay any confusion among=20
PG&E's 5.5 million customers.

He suggested publishing clarifications in newspapers that carried the=20
erroneous information, in PG&E customer bills and on Web sites.

Stanley had formed a ratepayers committee of business, government and=20
consumer representatives, saying they will be affected by PG&E's Chapter 11=
=20
reorganization.

But Montali decided that ratepayers do not qualify as creditors under=20
bankruptcy law and are not entitled to official status that allows them to=
=20
participate in the bankruptcy and receive funding from PG&E.

Stanley said she has not yet decided whether to appeal the ruling to federa=

Vow to sue for refunds may be a bluff, but he should keep pushing FERC=20
THE strategic choice facing Gov. Gray Davis in the struggle over electricit=
y=20
price refunds has come down to three questions: When do you negotiate, when=
=20
do you demand, and when do you bluff?=20
Negotiations are over, Davis declared Tuesday. He demanded that the Federal=
=20

=20
old,'' he said. ``They have to decide which side they're on.''=20
Probably no one but Davis knew to what extent he was bluffing when he also=

said, ``If you think California is going to settle for $1 billion in refund=

A FERC administrative judge said Monday that the amount due the state may b=

around $1 billion, or perhaps nothing at all, when counter-claims against t=

Energy experts are divided about whether the state would win a suit to=20

director Severin Borenstein, but that a court would reverse a commission in=

Frank Wolak, a Stanford economist, had the opposite view, when asked whethe=
r=20
the state has a good chance of winning: ``I think so. It happens all the=20
time.''=20
At a Sacramento press conference, Davis continued to insist that there have=

been overcharges of $8.9 billion. But other state officials conceded that=
=20
only $5.4 billion of that is actually on the table in the FERC proceedings.=
=20
Davis said he'll take what he can get there, and sue for the rest.=20

Lights go out on Davis' power show=20
Three new developments show that some economic reality finally is being=20
applied to California's electricity crisis:=20
First, ""The nation's chief energy judge said Monday that California is owed=
=20
maybe $1 billion in refunds from power generators, a fraction of the $8.9=
=20
billion demanded by Gov. Gray Davis,"" reported the Register yesterday. Even=
=20
that $1 billion amount might be balanced by the amount the state still owes=
=20
the power producers.=20




To suggest workable and market-oriented solutions to the California=20
electricity crisis.

Judge Curtis Wagner's recommendation will be taken up by the Federal Energy=
=20
Regulatory Commission, which is being petitioned for the money by the state=
=20
of California.=20
Because the judge's words will bolster FERC's apparent desire not to grant=
=20
the ""refunds,"" the state probably will go to court, where the matter could =
be=20
stuck for years.
""In the long term, this may indicate that competitive electricity has a=20
future even in California, but not thanks to the state,"" Robert Michaels, a=

professor of economics at Cal State Fullerton, told us. He's referring to t=
he=20

Gray Davis and other officials since the crisis began a year ago.
""FERC since the 1980s favors competition, within the parameters of politica=

t=20
owe $9 billion to California."" As this process continues, he said, another=
=20
positive aspect will be that a lot of facts will get aired. ""We'll see what=
=20
has been happening in the markets"" in which power is bought and sold.
Second, light already is shining on one area: This crisis was not ""Made in=
=20
Texas'' by cronies of President Bush, as Gov. Davis and other Democrats hav=
e=20
been contending.=20
In May, the governor attacked the president for ignoring ""the greed of thes=
e=20
Texas energy companies,"" such as Reliant and Dynergy.
In fact, according to information on state power contracts the governor=20
finally released Monday, Texas companies were way down on the list of=20
producers.=20
""In roughly the first five months of the year, the state shelled out $1.2=
=20

electricity, followed by $1 billion to Powerex, the marketing arm of BC Hyd=
ro=20
in British Columbia [in Canada]. It also paid $331 million to the Los Angel=
es=20
Department of Water and Power,"" reported the San Jose Mercury News.
Only about 10 percent of our state's power during this period came from=20
companies with headquarters in Texas.
Third, and finally, a new study by the Cato Institute shows what should be=

TIM REITERMAN TIMES STAFF WRITER July 11 2001 SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge Tuesday reaffirmed his decision to bar a= =20 ratepayers committee from Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s bankruptcy case and= =20 denounced the committee's attorney for suggesting that the action could=20 prevent PG&E customers from receiving refunds for excessive energy charges. Judge Dennis Montali ruled against a U.S. trustee and the ratepayers=20 committee in deciding that ratepayers as a group had no claims and were not= =20 creditors when PG&E filed for bankruptcy on April 6. But Montali criticized ""misguided remarks"" by a committee attorney on July = 5=20 and news media accounts that followed the hearing. The judge said the repor= ts=20 left the misconception that by disallowing a ratepayers committee, he would= =20 reject all claims of ratepayers and they could lose out on future refunds. The judge and PG&E officials emphasized that there are no matters involving= =20 PG&E customer refunds before the state Public Utilities Commission. State officials are seeking about $9 billion in refunds, however, from the= =20 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for alleged overcharges to Californian= s=20 by energy companies since last year. The distribution of any ratepayer refunds would be decided by the PUC, and= =20 customers would be paid whether or not they filed Bankruptcy Court claims b= y=20 a Sept. 5 deadline, the judge and PG&E attorneys said. The judge took the highly unusual step of directing PG&E and U.S. Trustee= =20 Linda Ekstrom Stanley to consider remedies to allay any confusion among=20 PG&E's 5.5 million customers. He suggested publishing clarifications in newspapers that carried the=20 erroneous information, in PG&E customer bills and on Web sites. Stanley had formed a ratepayers committee of business, government and=20 consumer representatives, saying they will be affected by PG&E's Chapter 11= =20 reorganization. But Montali decided that ratepayers do not qualify as creditors under=20 bankruptcy law and are not entitled to official status that allows them to= =20 participate in the bankruptcy and receive funding from PG&E.

Gray Davis in the struggle over electricit= y=20 price refunds has come down to three questions: When do you negotiate, when= =20 do you demand, and when do you bluff?=20 Negotiations are over, Davis declared Tuesday. He demanded that the Federal= =20 Energy Regulatory Commission order refunds now. ``The case is nearly a year= =20 old,'' he said. ``They have to decide which side they're on.''=20 Probably no one but Davis knew to what extent he was bluffing when he also= =20 said, ``If you think California is going to settle for $1 billion in refund= s,=20 we will see you in court.''=20 A FERC administrative judge said Monday that the amount due the state may b= e=20 around $1 billion, or perhaps nothing at all, when counter-claims against t= he=20 state are subtracted.=20 Energy experts are divided about whether the state would win a suit to=20 overturn a decision by a federal commission. The federal courts have some= =20 limited jurisdiction, according to University of California Energy Institut= e=20 director Severin Borenstein, but that a court would reverse a commission in= a=20 case like this is ``extremely unlikely.''=20 Frank Wolak, a Stanford economist, had the opposite view, when asked whethe= r=20 the state has a good chance of winning: ``I think so. It happens all the=20 time.''=20 At a Sacramento press conference, Davis continued to insist that there have= =20 been overcharges of $8.9 billion. But other state officials conceded that= =20 only $5.4 billion of that is actually on the table in the FERC proceedings.= =20 Davis said he'll take what he can get there, and sue for the rest.=20 The state argues that because FERC has determined that wholesale prices hav= e=20 not met the Federal Power Act's requirement to be ``just and reasonable,''= =20 refunds are in order. But the commission has not defined what portion=20 exceeded ``just and reasonable.''=20 Throughout his press conference, Davis used the prospect of litigation like= a=20 goad to spur the federal regulators into action. But if you listened=20 carefully, he also indicated he'll give them more time to consider the case= .=20 Considering the iffy odds of winning in court, we suggest he keep goading t= he=20 federal commissioners -- while giving them all the time they need. Wednesday, July 11, 2001=20 Lights go out on Davis' power show=20 Three new developments show that some economic reality finally is being=20 applied to California's electricity crisis:=20 First, ""The nation's chief energy judge said Monday that California is owed= =20 maybe $1 billion in refunds from power generators, a fraction of the $8.9= =20 billion demanded by Gov. Gray Davis,"" reported the Register yesterday. Even= =20 that $1 billion amount might be balanced by the amount the state still owes= =20 the power producers.=20 To suggest workable and market-oriented solutions to the California=20 electricity crisis. Judge Curtis Wagner's recommendation will be taken up by the Federal Energy= =20 Regulatory Commission, which is being petitioned for the money by the state= =20 of California.=20 Because the judge's words will bolster FERC's apparent desire not to grant= =20 the ""refunds,"" the state probably will go to court, where the matter could = be=20 stuck for years. ""In the long term, this may indicate that competitive electricity has a=20 future even in California, but not thanks to the state,"" Robert Michaels, a= =20 professor of economics at Cal State Fullerton, told us. He's referring to t= he=20 state's botched 1996 ""deregulation"" effort, which has been made worse by Go= v.=20 Gray Davis and other officials since the crisis began a year ago. ""FERC since the 1980s favors competition, within the parameters of politica= l=20 reality,"" Mr. Michaels added. ""Now we're at square one: The industry doesn'= t=20 owe $9 billion to California."" As this process continues, he said, another= =20 positive aspect will be that a lot of facts will get aired. ""We'll see what= =20 has been happening in the markets"" in which power is bought and sold. Second, light already is shining on one area: This crisis was not ""Made in= =20 Texas'' by cronies of President Bush, as Gov. Davis and other Democrats hav= e=20 been contending.=20 In May, the governor attacked the president for ignoring ""the greed of thes= e=20 Texas energy companies,"" such as Reliant and Dynergy. In fact, according to information on state power contracts the governor=20 finally released Monday, Texas companies were way down on the list of=20 producers.=20 ""In roughly the first five months of the year, the state shelled out $1.2= =20 billion to Atlanta-based Mirant, the most any company was paid for=20 electricity, followed by $1 billion to Powerex, the marketing arm of BC Hyd= ro=20 in British Columbia [in Canada]. It also paid $331 million to the Los Angel= es=20 Department of Water and Power,"" reported the San Jose Mercury News. Only about 10 percent of our state's power during this period came from=20 companies with headquarters in Texas. Third, and finally, a new study by the Cato Institute shows what should be= =20 done next:=20 lAbolish retail rate caps, allowing prices to be set by the market.=20 This would be a better system than the present one, where the state buys th= e=20 electricity and passes much of the cost along through the state budget (pai= d=20 by taxpayers) and bonds paid for by long-term electricity price increases.= =20 Higher immediate prices would encourage conservation and production, leadin= g=20 in time to lower prices. lMove to real-time pricing so people shift activities such as washing to=20 off-peak hours.=20 lAbolish the Independent System Operator, which moves electrons around.=20 Give this function back to the utilities, who did it far better before=20 ""deregulation.""

     Michelle and Peter, we (GSP) have determined that we are not a federal
     government contractor.  Based on feedback from GSP employees, we do
     sell newsprint to printers who print material for the federal
     government, but we are a 'second-tier' contractor, not a 'first-tier'
     contractor.  (Pat McCarthy, the local employment law attorney that I
     have been using, used these terms when David Howe and i talked to him
     today.)  Pat informed us that second-tier contractors do not have to
     abide by all the federal government requirements for contractors.

     Based on this, GSP does not plan to file EEO-1 reports or prepare
     affirmative action plans.  In addition, we do not feel that we are
     subject to an OFCCP audit.

     Michelle, since you left me the voicemail telling me that we are not
     included in the Enron EEO-1, i assume that also means that Enron's
     status as a government contractor does not force us to prepare EEO-1
     and AAPs.

     Please advise us if you feel we have made incorrect assumptions on any
     of this.

Does anyone have an idea as to why marketers, including EPMI, are not 
included in the list of subject companies:  Exh. B?  Since EPMI is not a 
subject of the motion, why should it answer?  Lying in the weeds may be a 
more prudent course of action.

I just spoke with Mary to make sure we have the same information.  Here are
the facts we have so far.  On November 4th, the CPUC filed a motion with
FERC to adopt the form of protective order that the CPUC entered, to compel
the production of documents and to shorten time to answer.  According to
Exhibit B (read to me by Nancy Pickover at Bracewell) the following CPUC
moved against the following entities:  AES, Williams, Duke, Dynegy, Reliant
and Southern.  Enron entities were NOT named in exhibit B.  This is not to
say that we could not be easily added to the group.  While the motion reads
as if the CPUC was moving against everybody, in fact, in footnote 2 they
state they are only moving against the entities named in Exhibit B.  We will
have Exhibit B in hand first thing tomorrow via FEDEX to confirm this.  To
repeat, Enron is not named yet.

Thanks
Gary

Subject: Important - CPUC Motion - Confidential Attorney Client
Privilege and Work Product


As you may already know, the CPUC filed a motion at FERC asking for a
protective order and to compel production of the information they subpoened
from us in the CPUC's OII case.  Given the timing, we should discuss this
on our conference call scheduled for tomorrow.

They request that we be required:
to answer their motion on Thursday,
to provide the information within 5 working days of a FERC ordering
production, and
to provide of P&L information and spread sheets detailing our deals,
specifically delivery point, delivery date, counterparty, volume and
price.

We may not have a problem providing this information for use by FERC in its
proceeding subject to a confidentiality agreement but I think we would
oppose their requests for:
the information to be provided for ""government eyes only"" -  this would
prohibit EPMI from defending itself vis-a-vis other market participants.
a FERC confidentiality order that would could allow FERC to ""share"" this
information with the CPUC (for purposes of the PUC's OII proceeding)
pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 824h(c).  16 USC 824g(c) requires the Commission
to make information available to state commissions as may be of
assistance in state regulation of public utilities.  We should argue
that 16 USC 824h(c) does not apply here given that we are not a public
utility nor does the PUC regulate how much market power wholesale
marketers exercise or the level of market power mitigation (these are
the bases the PUC provides for explaining why it should have this
information.)
the above contractual information to allow them to analyze the
competitiveness of the forward market to evaluate the wisdom of the
Commission's  decision to allow the UDC's ""unfettered access"" to the
forwards market.  This argument is unpersuasive given that the CPUC can
get information about the competitiveness of the forward markets from
the Wall Street Journal's listing of NYMEX prices.

Peggy, we had wanted to add NEPCO to the bid list of bidders for the EPC
bid for the Cayote II Project.  Greg Piper has informed me that PGE is of
the opinion that we cannot even have NEPCO participate in the bid because
PGE does not think that would be able to get by the regulators.

Before accepting this as fact, can you confirm that we can not even 
participate in the bid process because NEPCO is an affiliate of Enron.  It 
seems that the best interest of the rate payers is in getting a winning 
competitive bid.  Are affiliates precluded from competitive bids in this 
process?

Again, I don't want to accept a no without insuring that it's absolutely 
necessary.  Thanks for your help.

THE FINAL WORD 
CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST OF AN ENORmous stupidity crisis. Californians have been sitting in the dark because ... they didn't turn the lights on.
They say they're short of electricity. Yes, they are. Between 1988 and 1998, California's electricity consumption increased by 15 percent. Meanwhile California's capacity to generate electricity shrank by five percent, even as the state hesitated to build new power lines to tap into neighboring states' power supplies. 
Californians didn't want dams across their rivers, derricks on their ocean, power lines across their borders, or fossil fuel smoke in their sky. These might interfere with all the smart things Californians do, such as hang-glide. California was going to rely on ""negawatts"" - dramatic power conservation. (But California regulators put price controls on electricity that lowered prices, and even Californians weren't dumb enough to skip a bargain.) And California was going to rely on alternative power generation. With all the puffery from Silicon Valley dot.com start-ups, wind farms wouldn't be a problem. And doesn't Gwyneth Paltrow's star shine bright enough to operate a solar panel? But it turns out that alternative power generation is an alternative, mostly, to generating power. 
Californians are people who insist on growing their own vegetables, but they won't dig up the pretty lawn, won't plant anything for fear of getting dirty, and they use fragrant bath salts from The Body Shop instead of smelly compost. Let them make their crudites with crab grass. President Bush was wrong to grant an extension of executive orders requiring out-of-state utilities to supply power to California. And everyone is wrong to listen to Californians whine about electricity deregulation. 
There never was any deregulation. The California Public Utilities Commission merely changed its regulations, which apparently weren't stupid enough to meet Golden State standards. Under California's 1996 re-regulation plan, electric companies sold their generating plants and became distributors. They were required to buy their power on the wholesale spot market and forbidden to enter into any long-term power supply contracts. Retail electricity prices were lowered by 10 percent and frozen at the new rate until March 2002. 
This is like requiring A&P to sell you porterhouse at $2 a pound, no matter what the price of beef on the hoof. Imagine how many steaks there would be, and how many supermarkets. Go to one of those boarded-up grocery stores, purchase a phantom T-bone, screw it into a ceiling fixture, and try to light your house. You're in California. 
Californians devised a system of electricity sales that ignored every dimension of the free market. (Interesting that the ""Information Economy"" is centered in a place that's immune to information.) The free market is a yardstick, and Californians got smacked with it. Mideast oil jitters, cold weather, natural gas price spikes, and the plain unpredictable freedom of the free market caused wholesale electricity costs to rise and California utilities to go $12 billion into the red. 
California's governor Gray Davis responded with the full force of bikini beach brain. In a January 8 speech to the state legislature, Davis proposed creating a state agency to buy generating plants and build new ones. He threatened to expropriate power generators and transmission grids. He called for laws to allow criminal prosecution of wholesale suppliers who withheld electricity from California markets. And he said the state's universities and community colleges would build co-generating plants and become energy independent. (With gas produced by the cafeteria food?) Gray Davis sounded like Joseph Stalin with the IQ of Keanu Reeves. ""Everyone should understand that there are other, more drastic measures that I am prepared to take if I have to,"" Davis declaimed. 
""Take"" is the key word. Grabby Californians tried to regulate themselves into some cheap electricity. Hoggish California power companies went along because the stateimposed retail price ceiling was also a retail price floor. According to the Los Angeles Times, during the first 28 months of the scheme, Pacific Gas and Electric and California Edison made $20 billion from the legally required mark-up between wholesale and retail electric prices. 
Californians want to snatch that money back. ""Consumer advocates around California... said it did not matter that the utilities were returning investments to their shareholders,"" reported the January 31 Washington Post. ""They took the money and ran,"" said state senator John Burton. As opposed to Californians, who took the electricity and roller-bladed? Now the juice and the jack are both gone, and the California legislature has had to pass a bill authorizing $10 billion to try to clean up the mess. 
But the Californians could still pull a scam. The bill mandates long-term power contracts at rates that are way above what future prices should be. The hope, one guesses, is that Congress, or the President, or somebody will let the state skip out on those contracts once the costs are lower. 
It would be wrong to call Californians stupid. They're sleazy, too.

Linda requested some background and talking points on the pending RTO letter from Chairman Tauzin to FERC that is sitting on Chairman Barton's desk TODAY for his decision whether to co-sign the letter.  While we have not seen the text, we are told that it is ""anti-RTO"" and may go so far as to state or imply that FERC does not have authority to do what is doing with RTOs.  (We know this is the view of one of Chairman Tauzin's counsels, who formerly worked for Southern Co.).  Chairman Tauzin has been contacted by Entergy and the Louisiana Public Service Commission to send the letter.  I spoke to Chairman Barton's staff, Andy Black, this afternoon and relayed our concerns.  The Barton Subcommittee is now expected to mark up an electricity bill in December (per a Republican Member meeting held this morning).

ACTION ITEM:		Call Rep. Joe Barton (202/225-2002)

TALKING POINTS:

	1.	Should start with something about the Dynegy/Enron transaction (it will be strange if Mr. Lay or Steve calls 
Chairman Barton and does not start the conversation with some reference to the transaction).

	2.	Mentioning the transaction naturally leads into the importance of competitive wholesale markets for power,
both for consumers and for the largely Texas-based marketing, trading and merchant power industries.

	3.	We understand that Chairman Barton has been approached by Chairman Tauzin about a letter to FERC on the RTO issue.  We know Chairman Barton is well aware of Enron's strong support for FERC's RTO initiatives.  We respect Chairman Barton's interest in seeing to it that Congress does not abdicate its responsibility to make energy policy.

	4.	If, as we have been lead to believe, the letter states or implies that FERC does not have authority to act in the RTO arena, this will be seen as a potentially destabilizing development since FERC is so far down the road of creating RTOs.

	5.	While we understand some in Congress and elsewhere were concerned that FERC was moving too fast, as of the last FERC meeting earlier this month, that is no longer true even if it ever was true.  While we think RTOs should be created sooner rather than later, FERC is listening to state regulators and others who had concerns.

	6.	A letter from congressional leaders questioning FERC's authority goes too far in the direction of those who oppose any RTOs.  Furthermore, it is wrong as a matter of law.  The D.C. Circuit held in the gas cases and in the power cases on Order 888 that FERC has authority to address systemic discrimination, which is in large part what the RTOs are all about -- a remedy for iscrimination.","Talking Points For Rep.

Announcing the Formation of One Corporate Equity Investing Unit

To better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to our 
core businesses, Enron has formed one corporate equity investment unit.  This 
new unit, Enron Principal Investments, will combine the existing investment 
units of ENA, EBS and Enron Investment Partners.  Additionally, the Enron 
Special Asset Group will also become part of Enron Principal Investments.  
The strategy of Enron Principal Investments will be to work with all the 
business units of Enron to identify, execute, and manage equity investments, 
which leverage Enron's unique and proprietary knowledge.   These investments 
may be in the form of venture capital, LBO's, traditional private equity and 
distressed debt positions.   

Kevin Garland will serve as Managing Director, overseeing all activities of 
Enron Principal Investments.  Gene Humphrey, Michael Miller, Dick Lydecker, 
and their groups, will join Kevin and his group to form Enron Principal 
Investments.  This new business unit will report to an investment committee, 
consisting of Greg Whalley, Ken Rice and Dave Delainey. 

 Please join me in congratulating and supporting Kevin, Gene, Michael, Dick 
and the other members of this group in this effort.

Follow-up

Steve - 

Following up on our conversation Friday, we have advised Cliff Baxter's 
Assistant that effective immediately Cliff and his quests can pass through 
Security on the Plaza, without showing his access card or requiring his 
quests to sign in or identify themselves.  All he needs to do is approach the 
front Reception Desks and asking for entry.  The receptionists will recognise 
Cliff by sight and ensure that he and his quests pass through - without delay 
- by lifting the adjacent rope.

We are asking Cliff to use his badge at the card readers, as per standard 
procedure, when he is entering the building by himself.

We are also refining procedures and upgrading our IT systems/data base @ the 
Reception Desk, to make it easier on a visitor of any employee.  For example 
if you call down to the Plaza Reception Desk and advise that a visitor is 
expected, the receptionist will have a pass prepared so as to eliminate the 
sign in process.  The guest simply has to exchange their business card for 
the visitor pass.  Or if an employee shows their access card at the Reception 
Desk and asks that their guest gain entry, that guest can get a badge without 
signing in.  Again, we ask that the guest exchange their business card for a 
visitor pass.

We are  working on installing a new data base @ the Desk that will pull up a 
digitised photo of the employee (duplicate of what's on their badge) on the 
screen.  This will allow employees to get a temporary access badge without 
showing other ID and will speed process.

Finally, we are testing a small proximity access card which is designed to be 
a duplicate back-up for executives.  It is sized to fit on a key chain and 
works with our standard card readers.

- Bill

Article II of the NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT entered in connection with the 
sale of HPL to AEP (which closed as of June 1,2001) provides:

 ""ENA [for 3 months post-close] will not  solicit, negotiate or enter into 
any contract, agreement or arrangement for the purchase of natural gas on the 
HPL Pipeline from any Person which is a supplier or producer of natural gas 
connected to the HPL Facilities; provided, however, nothing herein shall be 
construed or interpreted as prohibiting ENA from entering into any such 
contract, agreement or arrangement which is less than one month in duration 
and involves or is related to an Enron Online transaction."" 

 This is not the most clearly drafted provision as it was the subject of much 
negotiation....and was significantly narrowed from the  original scope 
proposed by AEP.  Thus, please consult with me prior to entering into any 
solicitation, agreement or arrangement which might arguably be covered by our 
limited covenant not to compete on the supply side for 3 months.  There are 
many aspects of the post-close transition which will require cooperation 
between Enron and AEP/HPL and thus, it behoves us to carefully weigh the 
risks and rewards of ""stepping too close to or over the line"".

Further,although a technical reading of the non-competition agreement only 
applies to ENA, no ENA UPSTREAM deals which would violate this covenant if 
there were to be done as ENA should be done without clearance from Brian 
Redmond and me.

Please communicate this restriction to those who report to you and have need 
to be aware of this limited restriction.

Sincerely
 BNG

Barbara,
 This appears to be supply deal for deliveries at Katy that would be subject 
to the 90 day non-compete.  Sandi is in the process of getting me a copy of 
the non-compete so that I can determine if this deal is covered.  Do you have 
any thoughts.

		 Subject: Commodity Futures Act - Talking Points

Tori:  We have contacted Senator Gramm and Majority Leader Armey about the 
calls from Ken on Monday.  Because of the uncertainty of the Congressional 
schedule, both offices told us to call on Monday morning to schedule the 
call.  If Ken wants to make the calls unscheduled, we expect Armey and Gramm 
to both be in DC by Monday morning.

The numbers are as follows:

Senator Gramm  (202) 224-2934
Majority Leader Armey (202) 225-4000

Here are the talking points

** CONFIDENTIAL **

Talking Points on Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000

Background:

We have hit an impasse on the CFTC Reauthorization legislation.  On legal 
certainty, nearly all interested parties agree.  However, Senator Gramm 
continues to raise objections unrelated to legal certainty for our business.  
There are two issues (which we understand have primarily been advanced by 
Senator Gramm, one on bank products and one on SEC jurisdiction). Majority 
Leader Dick Armey is trying to gain consensus with the interested parties 
which include Senator Gramm, the Chairmen of the House Agriculture, Commerce, 
and Banking Committees, as well as the Department of Treasury, CFTC, and 
SEC.  Meetings are occurring on a daily basis, but little concrete progress 
has been made since draft legislation was released on October 9.     



Talking Points:

We need your help to resolve outstanding differences so that the Commodities 
Futures Modernization Act of 2000 can pass this year.  There are very few 
legislative days left and movement now on this legislation is essential. Do 
not let the Congressional calendar be the enemy of gaining legal certainty 
for this dynamic and growing industry.

The current version of the legislation provides important legal certainty for 
all physical commodity transactions (not including agricultural commodities) 
entered into on a counterparty-to-counterparty basis or on an electronic 
trading facility.  We strongly support these provisions.

The legislation eliminates concerns that our derivatives transactions may be 
illegal or that our online platforms may be unregulated futures exchanges.  
These provisions allow our businesses to grow and innovate.  Without this 
legislation the industry will be crippled with legal uncertainty and these 
platforms will develop overseas.  

Virtually all of the issues in this very complex legislative package have 
been resolved. We are indifferent to outstanding provisions, except to the 
extent that they impede passage of the legislation.  We cannot allow the 
great progress made to date, fail in the end.

If asked, about a possible solution to the logjam.  Answer:  Encourage 
Majority Leader Armey, Senator Gramm, and Secretary Summers to meet 
immediately to finalize the remaining issues.  Given time constraints, if 
such a meeting does not occur in the next few days, there may not be enough 
time to pass this important legislation.

Note: Congress will be going out on either October 20 or October 27.

Subject:	Confidential - GSS Organization Value to ETS


Here are my thoughts on the value the GSS (Global Strategic Sourcing) brings to ETS:

I believe totally in the concept of strategically sourcing our materials and services for ETS, which is the concept that GSS was founded under, while still within the ETS organization.  Basically the value that GSS has brought to the bottom line during the last year has been minimal to ETS.   The reasons for that statement, in my opinion, are:

*	The materials and services that ETS purchase are basic and routine.
*	Most of those materials and service providers were identified and sourced during 1999 and 2000.
*	ETS is reaching the point where we need fewer providers, not more.
*	New items identified are normally rolled into one of our already sourced NPA's.
*	Almost all large dollar items are bid out (three bids and a buy).
*	GSS's involvement and commitment to the deal ends with the contract signing.
*	ETS P&SM organization and our Contracts services group deals with the actual execution and the ringing of the cash register.


If the GSS organization went away tomorrow, we would need the following expertise brought over from their group: (currently this group is close to 75 people.)(and very highly paid individuals)

*	Two (2) negotiators - Contract Managers
*	Two (2) analysts
*	Two (2) contract administrators

The administration of the following services would need to be shifted to the ISC:

*	iBuyit System
*	Catalog system (part of iBuyit)
*	iPayit system

We would need to re-assess the value of the contract with SourceNet and whether we continue down that path or implement our own A/P department.   This would take very few staff adds to make that happen.

Let me know if you need any further detail.

Basically the value that GSS has brought to the bottom line during the last year has been minimal to ETS. The reasons for that statement, in my opinion, are: * The materials and services that ETS purchase are basic and routine. * Most of those materials and service providers were identified and sourced during 1999 and 2000. * ETS is reaching the point where we need fewer providers, not more. * New items identified are normally rolled into one of our already sourced NPA's. * Almost all large dollar items are bid out (three bids and a buy). * GSS's involvement and commitment to the deal ends with the contract signing. * ETS P&SM organization and our Contracts services group deals with the actual execution and the ringing of the cash register. If the GSS organization went away tomorrow, we would need the following expertise brought over from their group: (currently this group is close to 75 people.)(and very highly paid individuals) * Two (2) negotiators - Contract Managers * Two (2) analysts * Two (2) contract administrators The administration of the following services would need to be shifted to the ISC: * iBuyit System * Catalog system (part of iBuyit) * iPayit system We would need to re-assess the value of the contract with SourceNet and whether we continue down that path or implement our own A/P department. This would take very few staff adds to make that happen. Let me know if you need any further detail. Morris (713) 503-1409",1,"Company Business, Strategy, etc."

Hopes dim for a quick Edison deal 
By Kevin Yamamura
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published July 27, 2001) 
The Assembly will not return this week to consider a plan to save 
California's second-largest utility from bankruptcy, all but ending hopes 
that legislation would reach Gov. Gray Davis by a mid-August deadline. 
A group of legislators and Davis staffers has worked this week on an 
agreement that would restore Southern California Edison's credit and relieve 
the state of having to purchase energy for the utility. 
Assembly leaders, who convened the group, set an ambitious schedule that 
would have led to a vote today had they reached consensus and been able to 
recall enough of the 80 Assembly members from summer recess destinations. 
But the newly formed plan, which would issue $2.9 billion in consumer-backed 
bonds in exchange for several Edison concessions, remains too rough for a 
vote, said Paul Hefner, a spokesman for Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, 
D-Sherman Oaks. 
Hefner was quick to note that Hertzberg has the Assembly ""on call"" for the 
scheduled monthlong break and is prepared to ask members to return if a deal 
comes in the next three weeks. 
But staff and lawmakers said earlier that organizing a mass return after 
today would prove nearly impossible because Assembly members are expected to 
travel throughout the state and beyond. 
Davis set an Aug. 15 deadline in his original Edison deal and recently said 
he could call a special session forcing legislators to return if they do not 
authorize a plan by then. 
His spokesman, Steven Maviglio, said Thursday the governor is not ruling out 
that idea but is waiting to see what comes of further legislative 
discussions. 
""It's pretty clear that everyone's working pretty hard to form a consensus, 
but they're just not there,"" Maviglio said. ""The governor is optimistic about 
the Aug. 15 date."" 
Even so, Edison does not expect a solution by then. Company officials stated 
earlier this week that they would wait for a political deal at least until 
lawmakers return Aug. 20.

Sempra's trading unit generates a windfall  


\
objattph 
By Craig D. Rose  UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  July 27, 2001  Sempra Energy, 
the parent company of SDG&E, reported a 25 percent surge in profit to $137 
million last quarter but said yesterday it lost money on the sale of 
electricity under a long-term contract to California.  On the other hand, 
Sempra said its largest source of profits was its energy trading unit, a 
middleman that earned $69 million during the quarter buying and selling 
energy produced by others.  The results underscore the transformation of 
relatively simple utility companies into diversified energy holding companies 
that have learned to profit in new ways from the deregulation of electricity 
and the turmoil in energy markets.  The surprising announcement -- that a 
company lost money selling power during California's run-up in electricity 
prices -- was explained by Sempra as an intentional consequence of the 
long-term contract it signed with the state to provide power.  Stephen Baum, 
chairman and chief executive officer of Sempra, said the company agreed to 
provide a steep discount to California during the summer months but would 
recoup the losses later in the 10-year deal.  California sought long-term 
electricity purchase contracts so it could reduce its purchases in daily and 
near-term power markets, where prices reached record levels.  Critics say 
Gov. Gray Davis rushed into long-term deals because of concerns about getting 
through next year's election. They also say the contracts will saddle 
customers with higher costs for years.  The governor has acknowledged that 
long-term contracts might cause consumers to pay relatively high prices for 
electricity in later years, but he maintains it is a fair price to pay for 
lowering prices that were devastating the state economy.  Michael Shames, 
executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, 
said the steep discount Sempra provided to the state on power this summer 
raised questions about the governor's proposal to help San Diego Gas & 
Electric Co. clear a debt of $750 million.  SDG&E says it is owed that money 
for power purchases on behalf of its customers.  In a media conference last 
month, Davis said the agreement would eliminate the threat of a possible 
balloon payment for consumers, who he said might have faced the so-called 
balancing account debt as early as next year.  Shames says the proposal, 
which took the form of a memorandum of understanding, or MOU, is costly for 
consumers and a bonanza for Sempra.  He said the relatively cheap power 
provided by Sempra this summer ""makes the MOU sound like more of a hidden 
payback to Sempra than a real relief plan for local ratepayers.""  Shames said 
he will release an analysis of the state's Sempra plan next week. The state 
Public Utilities Commission is expected to rule on the plan in August.  A 
Sempra spokesman said there is no connection between discount power and the 
tentative agreement to clear the $750 million debt. Doug Kline, the Sempra 
spokesman, said the power contract with the state was signed in early May and 
the agreement on the balancing account was reached in mid-June.  Sempra 
Energy Trading, meanwhile, said only 10 percent of its $69 million profit was 
earned from sales of energy in the western region, which includes California. 
The trading operation earned $40 million in profit during the comparable 
period last year.  California's Independent System Operator, which manages 
most of the state power grid, and other investigators have said trading and 
bidding strategies were tools used by energy companies to raise prices during 
the California power crisis.  Though Sempra earned money on trading, its 
wholesale power generating business lost $9 million during the quarter. Baum 
said the discounts on electricity provided the state were the prime cause of 
the loss for Sempra Energy Resources but added that a plant outage also 
contributed.  Sempra Energy Resources, which co-owns a generating plant near 
Las Vegas with Reliant Energy, earned $2 million during the second quarter 
last year.  Baum added that Sempra's long-term contract with the state -- 
under which it will provide up to 1,900 megawatts -- has allowed its 
wholesale business to pre-sell about half the power it expects to generate 
from the Nevada plant, which will be expanded, and three generating 
facilities it expects to build.  Profits at SDG&E slipped to $37 million 
during the quarter ended June 30, down from $40 million last year, according 
to Sempra. SDG&E, whose business is restricted to delivering gas and 
electricity, said it provided increased customer service during the crisis, 
which lowered profits.  Wall Street analysts generally applauded Sempra's 
results, noting that the company was ahead of its plan to generate at least a 
third of its profits from its newer businesses by 2003.  ""They're really two 
years ahead of schedule for their non-utility businesses,"" said Brian 
Youngberg, an analyst with Edward Jones & Co.  Bud Leedom, a San Diego-based 
analyst with Wells Fargo Van Kasper, said Sempra's move into energy trading 
now seems shrewd. ""We never dreamed they were setting themselves for a 
windfall like this,"" Leedom said.  Investors pushed Sempra shares up 17 cents 
yesterday, to close at $25.49 in trading on The New York Stock Exchange.

Smog Rules May Be Eased
Power plants: EPA proposes a sweeping change in how utilities' emissions are 
curbed, a flexible approach favored by the industry.
By GARY POLAKOVIC and ELIZABETH SHOGREN
Times Staff Writers

July 27 2001

WASHINGTON -- U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Christie 
Whitman proposed sweeping changes Thursday in the regulation of power plant 
pollution that would replace five of the government's toughest programs with 
a single, flexible approach favored by utilities.

Whitman outlined a plan for cleaning up major components of power plant smog 
that represents a significant departure from the EPA's traditional regulatory 
dictums. She called for a major expansion of pollution credit trading, which, 
up to now, has had varying success.

Under the new plan, the EPA would scrap some of the most stringent measures 
devised by the agency to deal with power plant emissions. One provision to be 
set aside aims to cut harmful mercury emissions; another is meant to reduce 
emissions from Midwestern power plants by 85%; another is designed to restore 
visibility at national parks.

Especially unpopular with industry, one measure, known as new source review, 
requires the installation of advanced pollution controls whenever power 
plants are expanded or modified. It too would be phased out.

""New source review is certainly one of those regulatory aspects that would no 
longer be necessary,"" Whitman told Sen. George Voinovich (R-Ohio) at the 
hearing by the Environment and Public Works Committee. ""All of those 
[programs] could be aligned into one regulatory process"" that she said would 
work better than existing rules.

Whitman's comments offer the first peek into the administration's plans for 
cleaning some of the dirtiest polluters left in the nation. Debate over the 
administration's clean-air approach has shifted to Congress as it considers 
whether to revise the national Clean Air Act.

The magnitude of the proposed revisions caught environmentalists by surprise 
but buoyed industry representatives who say existing controls are costly and 
inefficient.

""She has raised an appalling prospect of junking virtually every rule and 
strategy to deal with emissions of electric companies in return for some 
vague industry-sought plan for an emissions trading scheme,"" said Frank 
O'Donnell, executive director of the Clean Air Trust, an environmental 
advocacy group. ""If they go forward with this, it means a wholesale fight 
over the Clean Air Act in Congress.""

After the hearing, Whitman stressed that the overall goal is to clean the air 
more efficiently than current rules do. Although the administration has not 
yet released a so-called multipollutant cleanup strategy, Whitman contended 
that collapsing several regulations into one far-reaching approach would be 
easier for regulators and industry to manage.

""What we're looking for is targets under this legislation that significantly 
clean up the air beyond what our current regulatory, statutory requirements 
would do,"" Whitman said. She added that new source review, for example, 
""could potentially be no longer necessary if you have the right kind of 
targets set in a multi-emissions bill. We have to wait and see where the 
targets are set.""

Utilities have lobbied Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force to 
prevent the EPA from aggressively enforcing the new source review regulation. 
Industry and administration officials say the provision is onerous and 
prevents plant upgrades, although EPA officials say it is a key tool for 
forcing dirty, old plants to cut emissions by up to 95%.

During the Clinton administration, federal officials charged that 32 
coal-fired power plants in several Southern and Midwestern states ignored a 
requirement that companies install advanced emission controls when their 
plants were upgraded. The government reached settlement with three utilities, 
but a provision in the Bush administration's energy plan stalled those 
enforcement actions pending a review of power plant controls.

C. Boyden Gray, attorney for the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council 
and former White House counsel for the first President Bush in the 1980s, 
praised the administration's proposal. He said major utility companies he 
represents, including Southern Co., Duke Energy Co. and the Tennessee Valley 
Authority, could clean up with greater flexibility and less cost under the 
plan outlined by Whitman.

""To put everything in a market-incentives basis is a great step. It would be 
a real breakthrough and a plus for the business community,"" Gray said.

For example, Gray said EPA has four separate measures to control nitrogen 
oxides from power plant combustion, including programs to cut acid rain, 
ozone and haze. Another program scheduled to take effect in May 2004 requires 
power plants in 19 states to cut summer emissions by 1 million tons annually. 
He said those programs can be confusing and costly and could easily be 
replaced by a credit-trading program run largely by power companies.

Under the program being considered by the Bush administration, an emission 
limit could be established at hundreds of power plants followed by annual 
reductions in mercury, a toxic metal, as well as smog-forming nitrogen and 
sulfur oxides.

However, a provision to reduce carbon dioxide, a gas implicated in global 
warming, was dropped under industry pressure.

Power companies that reduce beyond their limits could sell emission credits, 
which represent a pound of pollution, to companies that exceed their limits.

Although industry and free-market advocates favor such programs, they are not 
without controversy. The record of market-driven programs is mixed. On the 
one hand, the nation's acid rain program uses marketable permits and is 
widely credited with cutting sulfur oxides at less cost. On the other hand, 
the world's first market-driven program to tackle urban smog has not worked 
in Los Angeles, where nearly 400 power companies and manufacturers failed to 
achieve significant cleanup for the nearly eight years the program has been 
in effect.

Further, many environmental groups are wary of market-driven programs because 
by design they preclude active government intervention. Critics say such 
programs could potentially limit public review of power plant operations, 
allow emissions to concentrate in poor communities and slow efforts to cut 
haze in national parks downwind from plants that elect to buy pollution 
credits instead of cleaning up.

The Bush administration's power plant strategy was aired before the Senate 
Environment and Public Works Committee, which is chaired by Sen. James M. 
Jeffords (I-Vt.), whose dramatic departure from the GOP threw control of the 
Senate to the Democrats. Jeffords is proposing legislation, different from 
the administration's approach, that would control four power plant 
pollutants, including the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, an approach rejected 
by the Bush administration.

Prospects appear to be increasing that Congress will pass one or more 
measures designed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, a belated response to 
this week's decision by more than 180 countries to deal with the problem 
without the involvement of the United States.

Indeed, in recent weeks several members in the GOP-led House and Democratic 
Senate have voted on bills with the intention of disassociating themselves 
from President Bush's environmental policies before the next election.

Among the votes, the House struck down a provision supported by the Bush 
administration that could hinder progress on global climate change policy.

The Senate banned new coal mining and oil and gas drilling in national 
monuments. Other recent rebuffs included rejections of administration 
initiatives on such issues as the Endangered Species Act, hard-rock mining 
regulations and offshore drilling for oil and gas.

Federal Caps Didn't Deter Higher Prices
Power: Cal-ISO study says suppliers continued to charge as much as five times 
more than the imposed limits.
By NANCY VOGEL
TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 27 2001

SACRAMENTO -- After federal regulators limited wholesale electricity prices 
last month, big private sellers of power in California continued to ask as 
much as five times more for electricity than the federal cap, according to a 
confidential study by state grid operators.

The analysis by the California Independent System Operator covers only the 
first week after the caps were imposed June 20. Cal-ISO has submitted the 
data to federal regulators for potential investigation. The report is a 
summary of what Cal-ISO calls possible anti-competitive behavior by Duke 
Energy, Williams Cos., Mirant Corp., Reliant Energy and Dynegy Corp.

""In a truly competitive market we would expect these suppliers to bid very 
close to their actual operating cost,"" said Greg Cook, senior policy analyst 
with Cal-ISO's Department of Market Analysis. The state did not necessarily 
purchase any power at the high prices being demanded. Instead, the 
significance of the bids is that they show how California could find itself 
paying exorbitant prices for electricity again if hot weather returns and 
conservation slackens, said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who 
studies the California electricity market.

""The bottom line is that the generators are putting out these bids in 
expectation of high demand,"" he said. ""If weather all of a sudden gets really 
hot from Southern to Northern California, the bids submitted by generators 
could be very costly to California.""

Cal-ISO calculated the cost of production for each company based on the 
efficiency of its power plants and estimates of what each paid for natural 
gas to fuel the plants.

The average cost for the five was $105 per megawatt-hour, which closely 
matches the federal price limit in California, which now stands at $101 per 
megawatt-hour. According to the power bidding procedures, companies that bid 
at or below their cost of production often still get paid a higher price, 
allowing them to make a substantial profit.

On average, four of the five companies submitted bids either slightly below 
or slightly above their cost of production. But with the exception of 
Atlanta-based Mirant, each company at times submitted bids that were 
substantially higher. Houston-based Reliant, for example, bid as much as $540 
per megawatt-hour, more than five times its estimated cost. Overall, 
Reliant's average bid was close to costs, according to the analysis.

Cal-ISO identified companies by code in its report. Sources familiar with the 
study identified the companies for The Times.

The Cal-ISO report singled out ""Supplier 5,"" identified by sources as 
Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Energy, saying the company ""continues to bid 
significantly in excess of its operating costs.""

Duke owns two large power plants on the central coast. It marked up its bids 
an average of 88% beyond its cost to produce electricity, according to the 
analysis. For example, it cost Duke $85 to $121 to generate a megawatt-hour 
of electricity in the time period studied, the report shows, but the company 
offered to sell a megawatt-hour from $149 to $195.

Duke spokesman Tom Williams on Thursday said, ""The use of the data in some 
cases doesn't appear to add up and in all cases appears to be selective and 
could easily be misunderstood."" Duke sells nearly the entire output of its 
power plants under long-term contracts, and not on the spot market, which the 
Cal-ISO report studied, he noted.

Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley said, ""We're looking at the data, and we 
question whether or not it is correct.""

A combination of cool weather, heavy conservation, the start-up of new power 
plants and recently signed long-term power contracts that guarantee supplies 
have eased the state's electricity crisis in recent weeks.

Market prices that as recently as May averaged $271 per megawatt-hour have 
dropped to less than $100 per megawatt-hour.

The more abundant power supplies have freed grid operators to ignore 
higher-priced bids. But they will have to consider paying such prices to 
avoid blackouts if supplies tighten, Wolak said.

Such a scenario would test the effectiveness of the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission order issued June 19, he said.

The bids of the five companies analyzed were offers of sales to Cal-ISO, a 
Folsom-based agency that manages the electrical transmission grid serving 75% 
of California. Cal-ISO buys power on short notice to smooth the flow on the 
state's electrical freeway and avert blackouts.

As California's fledgling market began to go haywire last fall, Cal-ISO 
workers struggled to purchase as much as 30% of the state's power demand with 
just hours to spare. Since then, the market has stabilized, and Cal-ISO's 
purchases now amount to roughly 5% of the electricity California consumes.

Fueled by high electricity prices, power generator Calpine Corp. reported 
strong second-quarter results yesterday. 
Calpine of San Jose said profit for the quarter ended June 30 almost doubled 
to $107.7 million (32 cents per share) from $59.5 million (20 cents) during 
the year-ago quarter. Revenue almost quadrupled to $1.61 billion from $417.2 
million a year ago. 
Excluding charges related to the acquisition of Canada's Encal Energy, 
Calpine's net income was $132.2 million (39 cents), well above the 31 cents 
per share predicted by analysts, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. 
Calpine is on an ambitious path to expand its roster of generating plants. By 
the end of 2005, it expects to have 75,000 megawatts in operation in the 
United States, including 12,000 megawatts in California. A megawatt is about 
enough power for 1,000 homes. 
The company, which generates 2,428 megawatts in California, this summer 
opened the state's first two major power plants in a decade. The new plants 
in Yuba City (Sutter County) and Pittsburg generate 547 and 555 megawatts, 
respectively. 
Combined with a new plant in Arizona that sells power to California, 
Calpine's new facilities helped the state stave off threatened blackouts this 
summer, Chief Executive Officer Peter Cartwright said. 
Calpine is building the 847-megawatt Delta Energy Center in Pittsburg, 
scheduled to open in May, and a 750-megawatt plant in Kern County, due in 
June 2003. 
It is also awaiting an August decision by the California Energy Commission on 
its proposed 600-megawatt Metcalf Energy Center in San Jose. 
""California is a very good market for us,"" said Bill Highlander, a Calpine 
spokesman. ""The pricing in California has benefited Calpine."" 
However, he said, the company was not one of the traders that focused on 
making top dollar in California's volatile spot market, because its business 
model concentrated on selling electricity through long-term contracts. 
During the past few months, Calpine signed 10-year and 20-year contracts with 
the state for as much as 2,500 megawatts, at prices ranging from $58.60 to 
$73 per megawatt hour. 
With most of its plants fired by natural gas, Calpine wants to control about 
a quarter of the gas it uses, Highlander said. Its April purchase of Encal 
Energy for $1.77 billion more than doubled its gas reserves, to about 1. 7 
trillion cubic feet equivalent, according to Hoover's Online. 
Calpine's stock closed up $1.08 at $36.89 yesterday.

Generators continue to set high electricity prices

(07-27) 00:59 PDT LOS ANGELES (AP) -- 
Power wholesalers continued to demand higher prices for energy despite 
federal regulation that capped electricity rates, according to a confidential 
report by the California Independent System Operator. 
In one case, an energy company charged as much as five times more for 
electricity than the federal cap, which were imposed June 20. State grid 
operators have given the study to federal regulators for a possible 
investigation, the Los Angeles Times reported Friday. 
Five companies were identified by code in the report and sources familiar 
with the study named the wholesalers for the Times. They include Duke Energy, 
Dynegy Corp., Mirant Corp., Reliant Corp., and Williams Cos. 
The average price charged by the five power companies was $105 per 
megawatt-hour, which closely matches the federal price limit in California 
set at $101 per megawatt-hour. 
Four of the five companies submitted bids either just below or just above 
their cost of production. Houston-based Reliant, however, asked as much as 
$540 per megawatt-hour in some cases. Overall, the company's average bid was 
close to costs, the report said. 
The state wasn't required to purchase power at the rates set by wholesalers 
but the bids reflect a potential repeat of charging exorbitant electricity 
prices if temperatures soar and conservation dwindles, said Frank Wolak, a 
Stanford University economist who studies the California electricity market. 
""The bottom line is that the generators are putting out these bids in 
expectation of high demand,"" he said. ""If weather all of a sudden gets really 
hot from Southern to Northern California, the bids submitted by generators 
could be very costly to California."" 
The Cal-ISO report singled out Duke Energy, noting it ""continues to bid 
significantly in excess of its operating costs."" The report shows the 
company's cost to produce electricity was between $85 and $121 but it offered 
to sell a megawatt-hour from $149 to $195. 
Cal-ISO calculated the cost of production for each company based on the 
efficiency of its power plants and estimates what each paid for natural gas 
to fuel the plants. 
""The use of the data in some cases doesn't appear to add up and in all cases 
appears to be selective and could easily be misunderstood,"" said Duke 
spokesman Tom Williams.

THE ENERGY CRUNCH 
Environmental suit against power plant 
Expansion called danger to slough

An environmental group filed suit yesterday to overturn a permit granted to 
Duke Energy Co. to expand a major power plant south of Santa Cruz. 
Saying the permit was illegally awarded, the suit warns that the resulting 
project will damage the ecologically important Elkorn Slough. 
Voices of the Wetlands accuses the board that awarded the permit of violating 
federal law by not requiring Duke to use the best possible technology to 
minimize impacts on the environment around the Moss Landing power plant. 
If plans to expand the plant proceed without change, the group said, it would 
kill off critical organisms at the bottom of the food chain. 
The suit, filed in Monterey County against the California State Water 
Resources Control Board and the regional board that serves the central coast, 
seeks a court order to return the case to the regional water district so that 
more environmentally sensitive cooling technology can be ordered for use at 
the plant. 
State officials said yesterday that the issues raised in the suit were 
considered and rejected during the initial permit approval process last year, 
and again during the appeal process this year. 
The case comes amid enormous pressure on state officials, in light of 
California's energy crisis, to rapidly accelerate power plant approvals and 
expand the amount of power generation available. 
Against this backdrop, the state water board on June 21 essentially rejected 
environmental groups' appeal that had sought to overturn the district board's 
decision approving the Moss Landing expansion permit. 
On another front, board members of the California Energy Commission took 
testimony earlier this week on a proposal to curtail public review of plant 
project proposals, with one board member, Robert A. Laurie, acknowledging in 
an interview that he believed ""in some cases"" it posed one of the most time- 
consuming aspects of project approval. A recommendation is expected within 
the next month. 
Duke, of Charlotte, N.C., bought the Moss Landing plant from Pacific Gas & 
Electric Co. in 1998, when the Northern California utility sold off many of 
its facilities to prepare for deregulation of the energy market. 
The plant was built in 1950 using a cooling system technology that sucks 
water out of the Elkorn Slough and Monterey Bay to cool generating turbines 
before spitting the water out into the Pacific Ocean. 
The group says wildlife conditions and sea otter population have improved 
markedly since PG&E mothballed many of the generating units at Moss Landing 
in 1995. 
But Duke now is proposing to resurrect parts of the cooling system in a major 
expansion that will make Moss Landing the state's largest power plant after 
its completion next summer. 
With an output of 2,538 megawatts, the plant when completed is expected to 
account for 30 percent of all new electricity generated in California next 
year, serving about 2.5 million households in the Monterey, Santa Cruz and 
southern Santa Clara County areas, including San Jose. 
Regional water quality board officials declined comment yesterday, citing the 
pending litigation. But in public documents filed yesterday, water officials 
said cooling alternatives had been considered and rejected. The documents did 
not elaborate on why they were not mandated. 
Duke had acknowledged during the process that more ecologically sensitive 
technologies were available, but at prohibitive costs of $20 million to $50 
million more. 
Deborah Sivas, an attorney for the Earthjustice Environmental Law Clinic, 
which filed the suit on behalf of Voices of the Wetlands, considered the best 
technology alternatives mandatory, not optional. She said the board had not 
considered alternative approaches in reaching its conclusions.

Let's make a real deal with Edison 
July 27, 2001 
By JONATHAN LANSNER
The Orange County Register 
When any government official tries to play business executive, it's time to 
get nervous. Take the Edison bail out as evidence. 
At its essence, the deal works like this: Taxpayers give the utility a big 
pile of cash; the state gets some old, rickety transmission lines in return. 
Don't be fooled: The power bounty is basically a political ploy. 
The state doesn't need to control electric distribution. What politicos need 
is a face-saving trade as evidence that this is a business deal - not a 
government handout. The state probably should just write the check and eat 
its losses. But if bureaucrats wanted real remuneration from this bail out, 
California would eye some juicy Edison assets. 
As a public service, I'll list a few. Now, for argument's sake, I won't 
differentiate between the utility and its parent company, Edison 
International. Hey, lawyers built those walls between the two. Let 'em figure 
out how to take 'em down. 
For starters, you'd figure an energy-strapped state would like some regional 
power plants, no? Like the San Onofre facility. However, it might be 
laughable to see Sacramento-types defending their future handling of the 
local nuclear plant. 
OK, if that's a tad too dicey for the state, how about a coal-fired plant in 
Nevada? Heck, Edison had a buyer at half a billion bucks before the state 
oddly quashed that deal. Maybe the state could grab it from Edison -- then 
flip it to pay off electricity-related debts. 
Of course, buying one of the out-of-town power plants that Edison's sister 
company in Irvine has acquired might be educational for Sacramento. Owning a 
plant in Illinois or Pennsylvania or possibly New Zealand might show state 
honchos how easy - or not - it is to rig supply and prices. 
Alternatively, the state could demand a small entity called Edison Capital. 
Basically, it's a bank. One specialty: the politically correct field of 
affordable-housing lending. A good fit for bureaucrats. 
Speaking of money, there's the Edison pension plan. Governments are really 
good at running retirement benefits. Heck, California already has a huge one. 
There's got to be some economies of scale - real cash savings - in merging 
the Edison plan with some state pension fund. 
Do note that Edison's plan might be overfunded by about $400 million. You can 
bet, though, that the state would never have the nerve to play 1980s 
corporate raider: profiting by grabbing some of a company's overfunded 
retirement kitty. 
Finally, there's Edison International Field in Anaheim. Stadium naming-rights 
contracts must have some value since corporations always seem to fight over 
these promotional gimmicks. (The utility's parent company paid $50 million in 
1997 for two decades of ""free"" publicity.) 
Imagine the buzz the state could get out of the huge sign age on a nationally 
renowned stadium. Plus, maybe the Angels could be good corporate citizens and 
tie into this deal. 
It's possible they'd allow a slight change in the team name to better 
emphasize the state's role in the ballpark. So, how does ""California Angels"" 
sound to you?

California Sempra Continues Improved Results

Sempra Energy on Thursday reported another quarter of higher earnings and 
revenue, a sharp contrast to California 's bigger and beleaguered 
investor-owned utilities. 
Although California 's electricity crisis has pushed Southern California 
Edison and Pacific Gas & Electricity into insolvency--and PG&E into U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court--the parent of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern 
California Gas continues to post improved results on the strength of its 
non-utility businesses. 
Net income for the period ended June 30 rose 25% to $137 million, or 66 cents 
a share, up $25 million, or 55 cents, earned a year ago, the San Diego-based 
utility holding company said. Revenue jumped 40% to $2.1 billion. Pretax 
operating income rose 24% to $291 million. 
Sempra's earnings came in just ahead of the 65-cent average estimate of 
analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
""Our strong second-quarter performance is primarily the result of our efforts 
to accelerate growth through new businesses,"" Stephen L. Baum, Sempra's 
chairman, chief executive and president, told analysts in a conference call. 
Sempra is in a vastly different position than Edison International and PG&E 
Corp. because its electric utility arm was able to avoid the deep financial 
woes afflicting their respective Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & 
Electric utilities. 
SDG&E was first to sell its power plants two years ago and thus was freed 
from a rate freeze. That in turn allowed the utility to pass along to 
customers the soaring costs of electricity beginning last summer. The state 
Legislature eventually rolled back and capped the rates for SDG&E customers, 
but promised the utility it would be allowed to recover those losses. 
Edison and PG&E, however, continued to accumulate staggering debts because 
their retail rate freezes remained in place. 
In contrast, Sempra is solvent, with $1.5 billion in cash and $1 billion in 
available credit, Baum said. 
The performance of its utilities was lackluster, with Southern California Gas 
earning $47 million, unchanged from the second quarter of 2000, and SDG&E 
earning $37 million, down from $40 million in the year-ago period. But 
Sempra's unregulated businesses--including energy trading, power plant 
construction and operation, international electricity operations and energy 
services--turned in an overall strong performance, contributing 39% of the 
parent company's earnings. 
Sempra's trading unit provided most of that profit, contributing $69 million 
to second-quarter net income compared with $40 million in the same quarter 
last year. 
Sempra's stock gained 17 cents to close at $25.49 on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

California Calpine Doubles Earnings, Beats Forecasts Energy: San Jose-based 
company credits higher electricity prices in California and sales from new 
plants.

Calpine Corp., one of the biggest U.S. power-plant builders, said Thursday 
that second-quarter earnings more than doubled, beating estimates, because of 
higher electricity prices in California and sales from new plants. 
Profit from operations rose to $132.2 million, or 39 cents a share, from net 
income of $59.5 million, or 20 cents, a year earlier. Revenue almost 
quadrupled to $1.61 billion. 
San Jose-based Calpine opened plants in the U.S. with a combined capacity of 
1,545 megawatts--enough to light 1.5 million average homes--and benefited 
from existing plants in California . Calpine has insulated itself from rising 
fuel costs by buying natural-gas fields to supply its plants. 
""Given the strategy they have chosen, they're following through quite well,"" 
said Andre Meade, an analyst at Commerzbank Capital Markets Co. ""They are 
growing from a small base and adding a lot of plants, so we'd expect high 
growth."" 
Profit topped the 31-cent average estimate of analysts surveyed by First 
Call/Thomson Financial. Calpine said it expects to earn $2 a share this year. 
The average First Call forecast was $1.92, with a range of $1.80 to $2.04. 
Calpine's shares rose $1.08, or 3%, to close at $36.89 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
The shares had fallen 21% this year amid concern that generators might have 
to give back some of the profit they made selling power in California during 
the last year. In addition, cooler-than-normal weather and conservation 
efforts recently reduced power prices in the state. 
Calpine runs or is building natural gas plants in 29 U.S. states and Canada 
that produce more than 30,000 megawatts of power. The company plans to more 
than double capacity to 70,000 megawatts by the end of 2005. 
Calpine this month opened the $350-million Sutter plant, California 's first 
major generator in more than a decade. The company is building 11 plants to 
run during times of peak demand in the state and getting permits for four 
more, James Macias, who oversees Calpine's West Coast power plants, said in a 
conference call with analysts and investors. 
Separately, Arlington, Va.-based AES Corp., a power producer that supplies 
California and operates in 27 countries, said second-quarter profit fell 20% 
because of losses tied to currency fluctuations and the sale of a U.S. 
electricity retailer. 
Net income fell to $112 million, or 21 cents a share, from $140 million, or 
28 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 26% to $2.21 billion.

Cap No Bar to Higher Prices Power: Cal-ISO study says suppliers continued to 
charge as much as five times more than the U.S.-imposed limits.

SACRAMENTO -- After federal regulators limited wholesale electricity prices 
last month, big private sellers of power in California continued to ask as 
much as five times more for electricity than the federal cap, according to a 
confidential study by state grid operators. 
The analysis by the California Independent System Operator covers only the 
first week after the caps were imposed June 20. Cal-ISO has submitted the 
data to federal regulators for potential investigation. The report is a 
summary of what Cal-ISO calls possible anti-competitive behavior by Duke 
Energy, Williams Cos., Mirant Corp., Reliant Energy and Dynegy Corp. 
""In a truly competitive market we would expect these suppliers to bid very 
close to their actual operating cost,"" said Greg Cook, senior policy analyst 
with Cal-ISO's Department of Market Analysis. 
The state did not necessarily purchase any power at the high prices being 
demanded. Instead, the significance of the bids is that they show how 
California could find itself paying exorbitant prices for electricity again 
if hot weather returns and conservation slackens, said Frank Wolak, a 
Stanford University economist who studies the California electricity market. 
""The bottom line is that the generators are putting out these bids in 
expectation of high demand,"" he said. ""If weather all of a sudden gets really 
hot from Southern to Northern California , the bids submitted by generators 
could be very costly to California ."" 
Cal-ISO calculated the cost of production for each company based on the 
efficiency of its power plants and estimates of what each paid for natural 
gas to fuel the plants. 
The average cost for the five was $105 per megawatt-hour, which closely 
matches the federal price limit in California , which now stands at $101 per 
megawatt-hour. According to the power bidding procedures, companies that bid 
at or below their cost of production often still get paid a higher price, 
allowing them to make a substantial profit. 
On average, four of the five companies submitted bids either slightly below 
or slightly above their cost of production. But with the exception of 
Atlanta-based Mirant, each company at times submitted bids that were 
substantially higher. Houston-based Reliant, for example, bid as much as $540 
per megawatt-hour, more than five times its estimated cost. Overall, 
Reliant's average bid was close to costs, according to the analysis. 
Cal-ISO identified companies by code in its report. Sources familiar with the 
study identified the companies for The Times. 
The Cal-ISO report singled out ""Supplier 5,"" identified by sources as 
Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Energy, saying the company ""continues to bid 
significantly in excess of its operating costs."" 
Duke owns two large power plants on the central coast. It marked up its bids 
an average of 88% beyond its cost to produce electricity , according to the 
analysis. For example, it cost Duke $85 to $121 to generate a megawatt-hour 
of electricity in the time period studied, the report shows, but the 
company's bids ranged from $149 to $195 per megawatt-hour. 
Duke spokesman Tom Williams on Thursday said, ""The use of the data in some 
cases doesn't appear to add up and in all cases appears to be selective and 
could easily be misunderstood."" Duke sells nearly the entire output of its 
power plants under long-term contracts, and not on the spot market, which the 
Cal-ISO report studied, he noted. 










Calpine Net Soars
On Added Plants;
Sempra Profit Rises

Calpine Corp. reported net income nearly doubled in the second quarter, 
reflecting the independent power producer's aggressive plant-building 
program. Meanwhile, the parent of a San Diego utility said profit rose 25%. 
Calpine, of San Jose, Calif., said net was $107.7 million, or 32 cents a 
share, up from $59.5 million, or 20 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest 
results, which were in line with analysts' expectations, included a special 
charge of seven cents a share related to Calpine's purchase of Encal Energy 
Ltd., a natural-gas company. Revenue grew even more strongly, soaring to 
$1.61 billion from $417.2 million. 
Separately, Sempra Energy, parent of electric utility San Diego Gas & 
Electric, reported profit rose to $137 million from $110 million a year 
earlier. Revenue jumped 40% to $2.1 billion from $1.5 billion. Sempra 
Chairman Steve Baum attributed the growth, which stands in marked contrast to 
the financial woes of California 's other electric-utility-owning energy 
companies, to Sempra's unregulated operations. 
Calpine's profit increased despite paying substantially more for natural gas 
to fuel its plants. It spent an average of $4.80 per million British Thermal 
Units for natural gas, up from $3.31 a year before. At the same time, 
Calpine's revenue per megawatt hour of electricity sold also rose, to $71.03 
in the latest period from $64.80 a year earlier. 
At Sempra, Mr. Baum said profit from Sempra's biggest utility unit, San Diego 
Gas & Electric, fell 7.5% to $37 million from $40 million. Results were flat 
at its gas-distribution company, Southern California Gas Co. Sempra Energy 
Trading was the big profit center, generating half its total profit, or $69 
million, compared with $40 million a year earlier. 
Mr. Baum said Sempra's stock, which trades at a low price/earnings multiple 
of 10, still is being ""affected negatively by the California situation."" He 
also said the company made less money in spot-power markets than in prior 
quarters but nevertheless intends to invest $2 billion in new power plants. 
In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Calpine shares rose 
$1.08 to $36.89, while Sempra climbed 17 cents to $25.49. ","Energy Issues.

Gray Davis by a mid-August deadline. A group of legislators and Davis staffers has worked this week on an agreement that would restore Southern California Edison's credit and relieve the state of having to purchase energy for the utility. Assembly leaders, who convened the group, set an ambitious schedule that would have led to a vote today had they reached consensus and been able to recall enough of the 80 Assembly members from summer recess destinations. But the newly formed plan, which would issue $2.9 billion in consumer-backed bonds in exchange for several Edison concessions, remains too rough for a vote, said Paul Hefner, a spokesman for Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks. Hefner was quick to note that Hertzberg has the Assembly ""on call"" for the scheduled monthlong break and is prepared to ask members to return if a deal comes in the next three weeks. But staff and lawmakers said earlier that organizing a mass return after today would prove nearly impossible because Assembly members are expected to travel throughout the state and beyond. Davis set an Aug. 15 deadline in his original Edison deal and recently said he could call a special session forcing legislators to return if they do not authorize a plan by then. His spokesman, Steven Maviglio, said Thursday the governor is not ruling out that idea but is waiting to see what comes of further legislative discussions. ""It's pretty clear that everyone's working pretty hard to form a consensus, but they're just not there,"" Maviglio said. ""The governor is optimistic about the Aug. 15 date."" Even so, Edison does not expect a solution by then. Company officials stated earlier this week that they would wait for a political deal at least until lawmakers return Aug. 20.

Rose UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER July 27, 2001 Sempra Energy, the parent company of SDG&E, reported a 25 percent surge in profit to $137 million last quarter but said yesterday it lost money on the sale of electricity under a long-term contract to California. On the other hand, Sempra said its largest source of profits was its energy trading unit, a middleman that earned $69 million during the quarter buying and selling energy produced by others. The results underscore the transformation of relatively simple utility companies into diversified energy holding companies that have learned to profit in new ways from the deregulation of electricity and the turmoil in energy markets. The surprising announcement -- that a company lost money selling power during California's run-up in electricity prices -- was explained by Sempra as an intentional consequence of the long-term contract it signed with the state to provide power. Stephen Baum, chairman and chief executive officer of Sempra, said the company agreed to provide a steep discount to California during the summer months but would recoup the losses later in the 10-year deal. California sought long-term electricity purchase contracts so it could reduce its purchases in daily and near-term power markets, where prices reached record levels. Critics say Gov. Gray Davis rushed into long-term deals because of concerns about getting through next year's election. They also say the contracts will saddle customers with higher costs for years. The governor has acknowledged that long-term contracts might cause consumers to pay relatively high prices for electricity in later years, but he maintains it is a fair price to pay for lowering prices that were devastating the state economy. Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, said the steep discount Sempra provided to the state on power this summer raised questions about the governor's proposal to help San Diego Gas & Electric Co. clear a debt of $750 million. SDG&E says it is owed that money for power purchases on behalf of its customers. In a media conference last month, Davis said the agreement would eliminate the threat of a possible balloon payment for consumers, who he said might have faced the so-called balancing account debt as early as next year. Shames says the proposal, which took the form of a memorandum of understanding, or MOU, is costly for consumers and a bonanza for Sempra. He said the relatively cheap power provided by Sempra this summer ""makes the MOU sound like more of a hidden payback to Sempra than a real relief plan for local ratepayers."" Shames said he will release an analysis of the state's Sempra plan next week. The state Public Utilities Commission is expected to rule on the plan in August. A Sempra spokesman said there is no connection between discount power and the tentative agreement to clear the $750 million debt. Doug Kline, the Sempra spokesman, said the power contract with the state was signed in early May and the agreement on the balancing account was reached in mid-June. Sempra Energy Trading, meanwhile, said only 10 percent of its $69 million profit was earned from sales of energy in the western region, which includes California. The trading operation earned $40 million in profit during the comparable period last year. California's Independent System Operator, which manages most of the state power grid, and other investigators have said trading and bidding strategies were tools used by energy companies to raise prices during the California power crisis. Though Sempra earned money on trading, its wholesale power generating business lost $9 million during the quarter. Baum said the discounts on electricity provided the state were the prime cause of the loss for Sempra Energy Resources but added that a plant outage also contributed. Sempra Energy Resources, which co-owns a generating plant near Las Vegas with Reliant Energy, earned $2 million during the second quarter last year. Baum added that Sempra's long-term contract with the state -- under which it will provide up to 1,900 megawatts -- has allowed its wholesale business to pre-sell about half the power it expects to generate from the Nevada plant, which will be expanded, and three generating facilities it expects to build. Profits at SDG&E slipped to $37 million during the quarter ended June 30, down from $40 million last year, according to Sempra. SDG&E, whose business is restricted to delivering gas and electricity, said it provided increased customer service during the crisis, which lowered profits. Wall Street analysts generally applauded Sempra's results, noting that the company was ahead of its plan to generate at least a third of its profits from its newer businesses by 2003. ""They're really two years ahead of schedule for their non-utility businesses,"" said Brian Youngberg, an analyst with Edward Jones & Co. Bud Leedom, a San Diego-based analyst with Wells Fargo Van Kasper, said Sempra's move into energy trading now seems shrewd. ""We never dreamed they were setting themselves for a windfall like this,"" Leedom said. Investors pushed Sempra shares up 17 cents yesterday, to close at $25.49 in trading on The New York Stock Exchange. Bloomberg news service contributed to this report. Smog Rules May Be Eased Power plants: EPA proposes a sweeping change in how utilities' emissions are curbed, a flexible approach favored by the industry. By GARY POLAKOVIC and ELIZABETH SHOGREN Times Staff Writers July 27 2001 WASHINGTON -- U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Christie Whitman proposed sweeping changes Thursday in the regulation of power plant pollution that would replace five of the government's toughest programs with a single, flexible approach favored by utilities. Whitman outlined a plan for cleaning up major components of power plant smog that represents a significant departure from the EPA's traditional regulatory dictums. She called for a major expansion of pollution credit trading, which, up to now, has had varying success. Under the new plan, the EPA would scrap some of the most stringent measures devised by the agency to deal with power plant emissions. One provision to be set aside aims to cut harmful mercury emissions; another is meant to reduce emissions from Midwestern power plants by 85%; another is designed to restore visibility at national parks. Especially unpopular with industry, one measure, known as new source review, requires the installation of advanced pollution controls whenever power plants are expanded or modified. It too would be phased out. ""New source review is certainly one of those regulatory aspects that would no longer be necessary,"" Whitman told Sen. George Voinovich (R-Ohio) at the hearing by the Environment and Public Works Committee. ""All of those [programs] could be aligned into one regulatory process"" that she said would work better than existing rules. Whitman's comments offer the first peek into the administration's plans for cleaning some of the dirtiest polluters left in the nation. Debate over the administration's clean-air approach has shifted to Congress as it considers whether to revise the national Clean Air Act. The magnitude of the proposed revisions caught environmentalists by surprise but buoyed industry representatives who say existing controls are costly and inefficient. ""She has raised an appalling prospect of junking virtually every rule and strategy to deal with emissions of electric companies in return for some vague industry-sought plan for an emissions trading scheme,"" said Frank O'Donnell, executive director of the Clean Air Trust, an environmental advocacy group. ""If they go forward with this, it means a wholesale fight over the Clean Air Act in Congress."" After the hearing, Whitman stressed that the overall goal is to clean the air more efficiently than current rules do. Although the administration has not yet released a so-called multipollutant cleanup strategy, Whitman contended that collapsing several regulations into one far-reaching approach would be easier for regulators and industry to manage. ""What we're looking for is targets under this legislation that significantly clean up the air beyond what our current regulatory, statutory requirements would do,"" Whitman said. She added that new source review, for example, ""could potentially be no longer necessary if you have the right kind of targets set in a multi-emissions bill. We have to wait and see where the targets are set."" Utilities have lobbied Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force to prevent the EPA from aggressively enforcing the new source review regulation. Industry and administration officials say the provision is onerous and prevents plant upgrades, although EPA officials say it is a key tool for forcing dirty, old plants to cut emissions by up to 95%. During the Clinton administration, federal officials charged that 32 coal-fired power plants in several Southern and Midwestern states ignored a requirement that companies install advanced emission controls when their plants were upgraded. The government reached settlement with three utilities, but a provision in the Bush administration's energy plan stalled those enforcement actions pending a review of power plant controls. C. Boyden Gray, attorney for the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council and former White House counsel for the first President Bush in the 1980s, praised the administration's proposal. He said major utility companies he represents, including Southern Co., Duke Energy Co. and the Tennessee Valley Authority, could clean up with greater flexibility and less cost under the plan outlined by Whitman. ""To put everything in a market-incentives basis is a great step. It would be a real breakthrough and a plus for the business community,"" Gray said. For example, Gray said EPA has four separate measures to control nitrogen oxides from power plant combustion, including programs to cut acid rain, ozone and haze. Another program scheduled to take effect in May 2004 requires power plants in 19 states to cut summer emissions by 1 million tons annually. He said those programs can be confusing and costly and could easily be replaced by a credit-trading program run largely by power companies. Under the program being considered by the Bush administration, an emission limit could be established at hundreds of power plants followed by annual reductions in mercury, a toxic metal, as well as smog-forming nitrogen and sulfur oxides. However, a provision to reduce carbon dioxide, a gas implicated in global warming, was dropped under industry pressure. Power companies that reduce beyond their limits could sell emission credits, which represent a pound of pollution, to companies that exceed their limits. Although industry and free-market advocates favor such programs, they are not without controversy. The record of market-driven programs is mixed. On the one hand, the nation's acid rain program uses marketable permits and is widely credited with cutting sulfur oxides at less cost. On the other hand, the world's first market-driven program to tackle urban smog has not worked in Los Angeles, where nearly 400 power companies and manufacturers failed to achieve significant cleanup for the nearly eight years the program has been in effect. Further, many environmental groups are wary of market-driven programs because by design they preclude active government intervention. Critics say such programs could potentially limit public review of power plant operations, allow emissions to concentrate in poor communities and slow efforts to cut haze in national parks downwind from plants that elect to buy pollution credits instead of cleaning up. The Bush administration's power plant strategy was aired before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which is chaired by Sen. James M. Jeffords (I-Vt.), whose dramatic departure from the GOP threw control of the Senate to the Democrats. Jeffords is proposing legislation, different from the administration's approach, that would control four power plant pollutants, including the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, an approach rejected by the Bush administration. Prospects appear to be increasing that Congress will pass one or more measures designed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, a belated response to this week's decision by more than 180 countries to deal with the problem without the involvement of the United States. Indeed, in recent weeks several members in the GOP-led House and Democratic Senate have voted on bills with the intention of disassociating themselves from President Bush's environmental policies before the next election. Among the votes, the House struck down a provision supported by the Bush administration that could hinder progress on global climate change policy. The Senate banned new coal mining and oil and gas drilling in national monuments. Other recent rebuffs included rejections of administration initiatives on such issues as the Endangered Species Act, hard-rock mining regulations and offshore drilling for oil and gas. Copyright 2001, Los Angeles Times <http://www.latimes.com> Federal Caps Didn't Deter Higher Prices Power: Cal-ISO study says suppliers continued to charge as much as five times more than the imposed limits. By NANCY VOGEL TIMES STAFF WRITER July 27 2001 SACRAMENTO -- After federal regulators limited wholesale electricity prices last month, big private sellers of power in California continued to ask as much as five times more for electricity than the federal cap, according to a confidential study by state grid operators. The analysis by the California Independent System Operator covers only the first week after the caps were imposed June 20. Cal-ISO has submitted the data to federal regulators for potential investigation. The report is a summary of what Cal-ISO calls possible anti-competitive behavior by Duke Energy, Williams Cos., Mirant Corp., Reliant Energy and Dynegy Corp. ""In a truly competitive market we would expect these suppliers to bid very close to their actual operating cost,"" said Greg Cook, senior policy analyst with Cal-ISO's Department of Market Analysis. The state did not necessarily purchase any power at the high prices being demanded. Instead, the significance of the bids is that they show how California could find itself paying exorbitant prices for electricity again if hot weather returns and conservation slackens, said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who studies the California electricity market. ""The bottom line is that the generators are putting out these bids in expectation of high demand,"" he said. ""If weather all of a sudden gets really hot from Southern to Northern California, the bids submitted by generators could be very costly to California."" Cal-ISO calculated the cost of production for each company based on the efficiency of its power plants and estimates of what each paid for natural gas to fuel the plants. The average cost for the five was $105 per megawatt-hour, which closely matches the federal price limit in California, which now stands at $101 per megawatt-hour. According to the power bidding procedures, companies that bid at or below their cost of production often still get paid a higher price, allowing them to make a substantial profit. On average, four of the five companies submitted bids either slightly below or slightly above their cost of production. But with the exception of Atlanta-based Mirant, each company at times submitted bids that were substantially higher. Houston-based Reliant, for example, bid as much as $540 per megawatt-hour, more than five times its estimated cost. Overall, Reliant's average bid was close to costs, according to the analysis. Cal-ISO identified companies by code in its report. Sources familiar with the study identified the companies for The Times. The Cal-ISO report singled out ""Supplier 5,"" identified by sources as Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Energy, saying the company ""continues to bid significantly in excess of its operating costs."" Duke owns two large power plants on the central coast. It marked up its bids an average of 88% beyond its cost to produce electricity, according to the analysis. For example, it cost Duke $85 to $121 to generate a megawatt-hour of electricity in the time period studied, the report shows, but the company offered to sell a megawatt-hour from $149 to $195. Duke spokesman Tom Williams on Thursday said, ""The use of the data in some cases doesn't appear to add up and in all cases appears to be selective and could easily be misunderstood."" Duke sells nearly the entire output of its power plants under long-term contracts, and not on the spot market, which the Cal-ISO report studied, he noted. Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley said, ""We're looking at the data, and we question whether or not it is correct."" A combination of cool weather, heavy conservation, the start-up of new power plants and recently signed long-term power contracts that guarantee supplies have eased the state's electricity crisis in recent weeks. Market prices that as recently as May averaged $271 per megawatt-hour have dropped to less than $100 per megawatt-hour. The more abundant power supplies have freed grid operators to ignore higher-priced bids. But they will have to consider paying such prices to avoid blackouts if supplies tighten, Wolak said. Such a scenario would test the effectiveness of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission order issued June 19, he said. The bids of the five companies analyzed were offers of sales to Cal-ISO, a Folsom-based agency that manages the electrical transmission grid serving 75% of California. Cal-ISO buys power on short notice to smooth the flow on the state's electrical freeway and avert blackouts. As California's fledgling market began to go haywire last fall, Cal-ISO workers struggled to purchase as much as 30% of the state's power demand with just hours to spare. Since then, the market has stabilized, and Cal-ISO's purchases now amount to roughly 5% of the electricity California consumes. RELATED STORY Power profits: Power plant operator Calpine said its quarterly profit more than doubled. C2 Copyright 2001, Los Angeles Times <http://www.latimes.com> Calpine profits double on skyrocketing sales Escalating power prices inspire plant building program Carolyn Said, Chronicle Staff Writer <mailto:csaid@sfchronicle.com> Friday, July 27, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle </chronicle/info/copyright> URL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/07/27/ BU234287.DTL> Fueled by high electricity prices, power generator Calpine Corp. reported strong second-quarter results yesterday. Calpine of San Jose said profit for the quarter ended June 30 almost doubled to $107.7 million (32 cents per share) from $59.5 million (20 cents) during the year-ago quarter. Revenue almost quadrupled to $1.61 billion from $417.2 million a year ago. Excluding charges related to the acquisition of Canada's Encal Energy, Calpine's net income was $132.2 million (39 cents), well above the 31 cents per share predicted by analysts, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. Calpine is on an ambitious path to expand its roster of generating plants. By the end of 2005, it expects to have 75,000 megawatts in operation in the United States, including 12,000 megawatts in California. A megawatt is about enough power for 1,000 homes. The company, which generates 2,428 megawatts in California, this summer opened the state's first two major power plants in a decade. The new plants in Yuba City (Sutter County) and Pittsburg generate 547 and 555 megawatts, respectively. Combined with a new plant in Arizona that sells power to California, Calpine's new facilities helped the state stave off threatened blackouts this summer, Chief Executive Officer Peter Cartwright said. Calpine is building the 847-megawatt Delta Energy Center in Pittsburg, scheduled to open in May, and a 750-megawatt plant in Kern County, due in June 2003. It is also awaiting an August decision by the California Energy Commission on its proposed 600-megawatt Metcalf Energy Center in San Jose. ""California is a very good market for us,"" said Bill Highlander, a Calpine spokesman. ""The pricing in California has benefited Calpine."" However, he said, the company was not one of the traders that focused on making top dollar in California's volatile spot market, because its business model concentrated on selling electricity through long-term contracts. During the past few months, Calpine signed 10-year and 20-year contracts with the state for as much as 2,500 megawatts, at prices ranging from $58.60 to $73 per megawatt hour. With most of its plants fired by natural gas, Calpine wants to control about a quarter of the gas it uses, Highlander said. Its April purchase of Encal Energy for $1.77 billion more than doubled its gas reserves, to about 1. 7 trillion cubic feet equivalent, according to Hoover's Online. Calpine's stock closed up $1.08 at $36.89 yesterday.

In one case, an energy company charged as much as five times more for electricity than the federal cap, which were imposed June 20. State grid operators have given the study to federal regulators for a possible investigation, the Los Angeles Times reported Friday. Five companies were identified by code in the report and sources familiar with the study named the wholesalers for the Times. They include Duke Energy, Dynegy Corp., Mirant Corp., Reliant Corp., and Williams Cos. The average price charged by the five power companies was $105 per megawatt-hour, which closely matches the federal price limit in California set at $101 per megawatt-hour. Four of the five companies submitted bids either just below or just above their cost of production. Houston-based Reliant, however, asked as much as $540 per megawatt-hour in some cases. Overall, the company's average bid was close to costs, the report said. The state wasn't required to purchase power at the rates set by wholesalers but the bids reflect a potential repeat of charging exorbitant electricity prices if temperatures soar and conservation dwindles, said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who studies the California electricity market.

Saying the permit was illegally awarded, the suit warns that the resulting project will damage the ecologically important Elkorn Slough. Voices of the Wetlands accuses the board that awarded the permit of violating federal law by not requiring Duke to use the best possible technology to minimize impacts on the environment around the Moss Landing power plant. If plans to expand the plant proceed without change, the group said, it would kill off critical organisms at the bottom of the food chain. The suit, filed in Monterey County against the California State Water Resources Control Board and the regional board that serves the central coast, seeks a court order to return the case to the regional water district so that more environmentally sensitive cooling technology can be ordered for use at the plant. State officials said yesterday that the issues raised in the suit were considered and rejected during the initial permit approval process last year, and again during the appeal process this year. The case comes amid enormous pressure on state officials, in light of California's energy crisis, to rapidly accelerate power plant approvals and expand the amount of power generation available. Against this backdrop, the state water board on June 21 essentially rejected environmental groups' appeal that had sought to overturn the district board's decision approving the Moss Landing expansion permit. On another front, board members of the California Energy Commission took testimony earlier this week on a proposal to curtail public review of plant project proposals, with one board member, Robert A. Laurie, acknowledging in an interview that he believed ""in some cases"" it posed one of the most time- consuming aspects of project approval. A recommendation is expected within the next month. Duke, of Charlotte, N.C., bought the Moss Landing plant from Pacific Gas & Electric Co. in 1998, when the Northern California utility sold off many of its facilities to prepare for deregulation of the energy market. The plant was built in 1950 using a cooling system technology that sucks water out of the Elkorn Slough and Monterey Bay to cool generating turbines before spitting the water out into the Pacific Ocean. The group says wildlife conditions and sea otter population have improved markedly since PG&E mothballed many of the generating units at Moss Landing in 1995. But Duke now is proposing to resurrect parts of the cooling system in a major expansion that will make Moss Landing the state's largest power plant after its completion next summer. With an output of 2,538 megawatts, the plant when completed is expected to account for 30 percent of all new electricity generated in California next year, serving about 2.5 million households in the Monterey, Santa Cruz and southern Santa Clara County areas, including San Jose. Regional water quality board officials declined comment yesterday, citing the pending litigation. But in public documents filed yesterday, water officials said cooling alternatives had been considered and rejected. The documents did not elaborate on why they were not mandated. Duke had acknowledged during the process that more ecologically sensitive technologies were available, but at prohibitive costs of $20 million to $50 million more. Deborah Sivas, an attorney for the Earthjustice Environmental Law Clinic, which filed the suit on behalf of Voices of the Wetlands, considered the best technology alternatives mandatory, not optional. She said the board had not considered alternative approaches in reaching its conclusions.

Take the Edison bail out as evidence. At its essence, the deal works like this: Taxpayers give the utility a big pile of cash; the state gets some old, rickety transmission lines in return. Don't be fooled: The power bounty is basically a political ploy. The state doesn't need to control electric distribution. What politicos need is a face-saving trade as evidence that this is a business deal - not a government handout. The state probably should just write the check and eat its losses. But if bureaucrats wanted real remuneration from this bail out, California would eye some juicy Edison assets. As a public service, I'll list a few. Now, for argument's sake, I won't differentiate between the utility and its parent company, Edison International. Hey, lawyers built those walls between the two. Let 'em figure out how to take 'em down. For starters, you'd figure an energy-strapped state would like some regional power plants, no? Like the San Onofre facility. However, it might be laughable to see Sacramento-types defending their future handling of the local nuclear plant. OK, if that's a tad too dicey for the state, how about a coal-fired plant in Nevada? Heck, Edison had a buyer at half a billion bucks before the state oddly quashed that deal. Maybe the state could grab it from Edison -- then flip it to pay off electricity-related debts. Of course, buying one of the out-of-town power plants that Edison's sister company in Irvine has acquired might be educational for Sacramento. Owning a plant in Illinois or Pennsylvania or possibly New Zealand might show state honchos how easy - or not - it is to rig supply and prices. Alternatively, the state could demand a small entity called Edison Capital. Basically, it's a bank. One specialty: the politically correct field of affordable-housing lending. A good fit for bureaucrats. Speaking of money, there's the Edison pension plan. Governments are really good at running retirement benefits. Heck, California already has a huge one. There's got to be some economies of scale - real cash savings - in merging the Edison plan with some state pension fund. Do note that Edison's plan might be overfunded by about $400 million. You can bet, though, that the state would never have the nerve to play 1980s corporate raider: profiting by grabbing some of a company's overfunded retirement kitty. Finally, there's Edison International Field in Anaheim. Stadium naming-rights contracts must have some value since corporations always seem to fight over these promotional gimmicks. (The utility's parent company paid $50 million in 1997 for two decades of ""free"" publicity.) Imagine the buzz the state could get out of the huge sign age on a nationally renowned stadium. Plus, maybe the Angels could be good corporate citizens and tie into this deal. It's possible they'd allow a slight change in the team name to better emphasize the state's role in the ballpark. So, how does ""California Angels"" sound to you? Business; Financial Desk California Sempra Continues Improved Results NANCY RIVERA BROOKS 07/27/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page C-2 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company Sempra Energy on Thursday reported another quarter of higher earnings and revenue, a sharp contrast to California 's bigger and beleaguered investor-owned utilities. Although California 's electricity crisis has pushed Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electricity into insolvency--and PG&E into U.S. Bankruptcy Court--the parent of San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Gas continues to post improved results on the strength of its non-utility businesses. Net income for the period ended June 30 rose 25% to $137 million, or 66 cents a share, up $25 million, or 55 cents, earned a year ago, the San Diego-based utility holding company said. Revenue jumped 40% to $2.1 billion. Pretax operating income rose 24% to $291 million. Sempra's earnings came in just ahead of the 65-cent average estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. ""Our strong second-quarter performance is primarily the result of our efforts to accelerate growth through new businesses,"" Stephen L. Baum, Sempra's chairman, chief executive and president, told analysts in a conference call. Sempra is in a vastly different position than Edison International and PG&E Corp. because its electric utility arm was able to avoid the deep financial woes afflicting their respective Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric utilities. SDG&E was first to sell its power plants two years ago and thus was freed from a rate freeze. That in turn allowed the utility to pass along to customers the soaring costs of electricity beginning last summer. The state Legislature eventually rolled back and capped the rates for SDG&E customers, but promised the utility it would be allowed to recover those losses. Edison and PG&E, however, continued to accumulate staggering debts because their retail rate freezes remained in place. In contrast, Sempra is solvent, with $1.5 billion in cash and $1 billion in available credit, Baum said. The performance of its utilities was lackluster, with Southern California Gas earning $47 million, unchanged from the second quarter of 2000, and SDG&E earning $37 million, down from $40 million in the year-ago period. But Sempra's unregulated businesses--including energy trading, power plant construction and operation, international electricity operations and energy services--turned in an overall strong performance, contributing 39% of the parent company's earnings. Sempra's trading unit provided most of that profit, contributing $69 million to second-quarter net income compared with $40 million in the same quarter last year. Sempra's stock gained 17 cents to close at $25.49 on the New York Stock Exchange. Business; Financial Desk California Calpine Doubles Earnings, Beats Forecasts Energy: San Jose-based company credits higher electricity prices in California and sales from new plants. 07/27/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page C-2 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company Calpine Corp., one of the biggest U.S. power-plant builders, said Thursday that second-quarter earnings more than doubled, beating estimates, because of higher electricity prices in California and sales from new plants. Profit from operations rose to $132.2 million, or 39 cents a share, from net income of $59.5 million, or 20 cents, a year earlier. Revenue almost quadrupled to $1.61 billion. San Jose-based Calpine opened plants in the U.S. with a combined capacity of 1,545 megawatts--enough to light 1.5 million average homes--and benefited from existing plants in California . Calpine has insulated itself from rising fuel costs by buying natural-gas fields to supply its plants. ""Given the strategy they have chosen, they're following through quite well,"" said Andre Meade, an analyst at Commerzbank Capital Markets Co. ""They are growing from a small base and adding a lot of plants, so we'd expect high growth."" Profit topped the 31-cent average estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. Calpine said it expects to earn $2 a share this year. The average First Call forecast was $1.92, with a range of $1.80 to $2.04. Calpine's shares rose $1.08, or 3%, to close at $36.89 on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares had fallen 21% this year amid concern that generators might have to give back some of the profit they made selling power in California during the last year. In addition, cooler-than-normal weather and conservation efforts recently reduced power prices in the state. Calpine runs or is building natural gas plants in 29 U.S. states and Canada that produce more than 30,000 megawatts of power. The company plans to more than double capacity to 70,000 megawatts by the end of 2005. Calpine this month opened the $350-million Sutter plant, California 's first major generator in more than a decade. The company is building 11 plants to run during times of peak demand in the state and getting permits for four more, James Macias, who oversees Calpine's West Coast power plants, said in a conference call with analysts and investors. Separately, Arlington, Va.-based AES Corp., a power producer that supplies California and operates in 27 countries, said second-quarter profit fell 20% because of losses tied to currency fluctuations and the sale of a U.S. electricity retailer. Net income fell to $112 million, or 21 cents a share, from $140 million, or 28 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 26% to $2.21 billion.

But with the exception of Atlanta-based Mirant, each company at times submitted bids that were substantially higher. Houston-based Reliant, for example, bid as much as $540 per megawatt-hour, more than five times its estimated cost. Overall, Reliant's average bid was close to costs, according to the analysis. Cal-ISO identified companies by code in its report. Sources familiar with the study identified the companies for The Times. The Cal-ISO report singled out ""Supplier 5,"" identified by sources as Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Energy, saying the company ""continues to bid significantly in excess of its operating costs."" Duke owns two large power plants on the central coast. It marked up its bids an average of 88% beyond its cost to produce electricity , according to the analysis. For example, it cost Duke $85 to $121 to generate a megawatt-hour of electricity in the time period studied, the report shows, but the company's bids ranged from $149 to $195 per megawatt-hour. Duke spokesman Tom Williams on Thursday said, ""The use of the data in some cases doesn't appear to add up and in all cases appears to be selective and could easily be misunderstood."" Duke sells nearly the entire output of its power plants under long-term contracts, and not on the spot market, which the Cal-ISO report studied, he noted. Calpine Net Soars On Added Plants; Sempra Profit Rises By Rebecca Smith 07/27/2001 The Wall Street Journal Page B4 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) Calpine Corp. reported net income nearly doubled in the second quarter, reflecting the independent power producer's aggressive plant-building program. Meanwhile, the parent of a San Diego utility said profit rose 25%. Calpine, of San Jose, Calif., said net was $107.7 million, or 32 cents a share, up from $59.5 million, or 20 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest results, which were in line with analysts' expectations, included a special charge of seven cents a share related to Calpine's purchase of Encal Energy Ltd., a natural-gas company. Revenue grew even more strongly, soaring to $1.61 billion from $417.2 million. Separately, Sempra Energy, parent of electric utility San Diego Gas & Electric, reported profit rose to $137 million from $110 million a year earlier. Revenue jumped 40% to $2.1 billion from $1.5 billion. Sempra Chairman Steve Baum attributed the growth, which stands in marked contrast to the financial woes of California 's other electric-utility-owning energy companies, to Sempra's unregulated operations. Calpine's profit increased despite paying substantially more for natural gas to fuel its plants. It spent an average of $4.80 per million British Thermal Units for natural gas, up from $3.31 a year before. At the same time, Calpine's revenue per megawatt hour of electricity sold also rose, to $71.03 in the latest period from $64.80 a year earlier. At Sempra, Mr. Baum said profit from Sempra's biggest utility unit, San Diego Gas & Electric, fell 7.5% to $37 million from $40 million. Results were flat at its gas-distribution company, Southern California Gas Co. Sempra Energy Trading was the big profit center, generating half its total profit, or $69 million, compared with $40 million a year earlier. Mr. Baum said Sempra's stock, which trades at a low price/earnings multiple of 10, still is being ""affected negatively by the California situation."" He also said the company made less money in spot-power markets than in prior quarters but nevertheless intends to invest $2 billion in new power plants. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Calpine shares rose $1.08 to $36.89, while Sempra climbed 17 cents to $25.49.",1,"Company Business, Strategy, etc."
